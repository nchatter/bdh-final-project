He does not teach anything, and he often invites guest faculty to lecture.  Final grades are arbitrary based on how much he likes you.  If you're an InfoSec major, good luck because this professor's courses are mandatory.

                      Dr. Balic is really good with AutoCad and Civil3D. You will know AutoCad very well by the end of the semester. Civil3D is a hard software to learn, but if you understand the labs you will be fine. Her lectures tend to be slow, and attendance is part of your grade.

                      I've heard wonderful things about Baron for 2312, but do NOT take him for 2311. He teaches the class as if you already know 2311 (b/c he's used to his students knowing it). He didn't explain any mechanisms in detail, and went way too fast. He was out the last week of the semester &amp; made us learn an entire chapter ON OUR OWN, &amp; tested it on final

                      Dr. Beck was my recitation professor for ECE2026. He was absolutely essential in understanding that class and made one of the harder classes at Georgia Tech an absolute breeze. He was clear, concise, and thorough in his recitation.

                      ECE2020 is a disaster. There is no recitation, no textbook, no good TAs, and no explanation apart from the one provided by the professor. Sadly, Beck wouldn't even post his lecture notes online, so it was tough to copy all the circuit diagrams and understand what was going on. Also, his office is not even in the GT campus.

                      Dr. Beck was a very clear teacher. He gave relevant class examples and his notes were very thorough. His tests were similar to a combination of notes and homework. He was a really interesting guy who was always willing to talk. I would absolutely recommend him for ECE2020

                      Dr. Behrens provides one of the most balanced experiences I've had in the ChBE department at Georgia Tech. I really appreciate that he creates original exams and quizzes every semester even if he is teaching the same class. He is also an ACTUALLY funny guy, which makes it that much better to be in lecture. Overall, a PHENOMENAL professor!

                      Dr. Behrens was a great professor! Super passionate &amp; gave great examples of the material we studied! Material is interesting and is presented in a way that facilitates understanding. Tests are average, Homework is tedious, project is easy. He was sometimes stubborn about certain answers on assessments that didn't (&amp; still don't) make sense.

                      Transport is a difficult, math intensive class, but Dr. Behrens makes it as accessible as I think it gets. He posts lecture notes, offers many office hours, and generally seems to care about students. His grading curves were 85 for A, 70 for B, and 55 for C. Projects were graded leniently- class averge of 96. Exams are fair to challenging.

                      Igor is a fair grader, and I guess he's an alright lecturer, not always the clearest explainer. Sit towards the front of the lecture hall because he's kinda difficult to hear. He also has a fairly thick accent, definitely not impossible to understand, but I had trouble understanding him during 8am lectures. Fair grading scale. 85+ is an A.

                      Professor Belegradek can get a little bit confusing during lectures but is always willing to answer questions and really cares to make sure that all of his students fully understand the material in the end. If you make the effort to ask him questions and go to his office hours, you will not regret it.

                      Professor Igor Belegradek makes sure we really understand the concepts in Linear Algebra instead of just doing computations. The tests are highly conceptual but these tests are based on the practice problems he releases before the test. He always answers questions on Piazza in a detailed and specific manner. Best Math Professor I have ever had.

                      Igor's style of teaching is difficult to grasp at first, but if you put the time into the class, you will do well. Practice problems and reading the textbook are key to doing well in the class.

                      It certainly felt impossible to succeed. I skipped lecturesarned through recitations, tutoring, and the textbook. Practice problems are given out before each exam that mimic questions on exam-if you have ALL answers to these problems, you are solid. Obtaining sufficient answers to theory questions is easier said than done; Piazza is a life saver

                      DO NOT TAKE HIM!!! He is horrible at teaching. He doesn't respect you at all. When you ask him a question he just quotes the syllabus or tells us to look at the syllabus. He has a strong accent and is hard to understand even though I speak his language. He is to fast and the exams our way to theoretical.
                  </p>, <p class=""commentsParagraph"">
                      Igor was a horrible teacher in that his entire lecture philosophy seems to be based off of two key ""facts"" - that everyone comes into the class with a background in linear algebra (not necessarily true) and that people understand what he his saying. He is both fast-paced and unclear and makes tons of mistakes in lectures. Take virtually anyone else

                      Belegradek has a pretty thick accent that takes some getting used to. TAs can be hit or miss for the class. Lectures are organized and informative, but the textbook is easier to understand. Weekly quizzes and homeworks were easy. Tests are typically 20 points over 7 questions, but grading is fair. A is an 85%, B is 70% and so on.

                      Has an accent and is very hard to understand in lecture. Tests all all theoretical (given this, prove why... ), and he gives easy online homework that takes up a good chunk of the grade. An okay class and professor, but you may find yourself learning it all out of the textbook.

                      Homeworks are easy. Igor has an accent but is still understandable. Quiz every recitation, pretty straightforward, totally hit or miss though, dropped bottom 3 so it was fine. Tests are all theory and he teaches the class like an honors class according to my TA. Very approachable for office hours. Reading textbook can almost substitute for lectures

                      He's a very smart person, and he knows his linear algebra, but he isn't the greatest teacher. His lectures are difficult to understand and he cannot engage his students. His tests are also difficult, it's largely based on theory.

                      Be prepared to teach yourself linear algebra. If you have a hard time understanding a Russian accent, skip lecture. Plus side of the class is getting to use crib sheets during the test and final. Take another professor if you can!!

                      Prof. Belegradek is a really good teacher who tries his very best to make sure his students are actually learning. The homework takes up to ten minutes every week, he gives out questions before quizzes and tests and usually asks similar ones on the tests. His accent is a little problematic but it's not that big a deal. Grades are curved, 85 is A.
                  </p>, <p class=""commentsParagraph"">
                      Weekly quizzes on ungraded HW and MyMathLab enforce learning. Tests are straight-forward, and based on the HWreview sheet but can be tough even so. Russian accent forces you to concentrate to follow the lecture. Attendance helps understanding- Igor is very enthusiastic about the material. Grades were slightly curved at the end: 85  A, 70  B, etc

                      Igor has a great sense of humor, but has a thick Russian accent that may be hard to understand for some people (although not the case for me). My TA was baller so I was ok with the class. Advice: do hw (although optional for the class), and ask questions during lectures or recitation on HW problems you did not understand.

                      The material was very understandable once it was explained by a great tutor. The professor is completely ineffective as a teacher, his heavy accent and writing make him impossible to follow. He also confuses even himself during lecture, not to mention all the students, he makes very simple concepts and theorems seem inexorably complex.

Luckily I took this class pass/fail because the class average is around a 65 (9.5/15 quiz avg), and I was around a 10.5, and he really didn't curve all that much even though I expected that he would.

                      Ridiculously unorganized. We found out about assignments 2 days before they were due. TAs did most of the teaching but rarely correlate with what Botchwey was going over. He has horrible handwriting and doesn't know how to use his own technology. Poor grading system with little structure. Most test were curved because the average was below a 50.

                      Dr. Botchwey is terribly disorganized and you will learn very little without complete dependence on good TA/self effort. His general format for class consists of telling students to open a practice quiz and work on it in groups, later going through the problem in a disorganized if not incorrect fashion. He is regularly not present either

                      This class was very disorganized, and there was a general lack of communication. Dates of HW, quizzes, and tests were almost always changed. Also, these usually had to be done on paper and then uploaded to T-Square, which was confusing. However, Dr. Botchwey was frequently willing to listen and make changes. Most questions came from the book.

                      Really funny guy- reason I showed up to lectures besides the poll question. This class is difficult in general, but his office hours as well as the TAs were really helpful. His accent can be hard to understand at first, but it's only an issue when he gets really excited about a problem. Final kills your grade and no curve.

                      Not as organized as some of the other professors but makes up for it during his Lectures. Didn't realize how great of an explainer he is until we had substitutes in the class. Hilarious guy, funniest part was when he read his own ratemyprofessor reviews to the class. Linear algebra in general is hard so don't just rely on lectures/recitation.

                      One of the best professors you could take. Definitely recommend taking him, especially for Linear Algebra.

Lots of reading though.

Not only have I matured in English, I have also gained some critical thinking skills. You read a lot, yes. But this is an English class. I suggest picking a class in which you would read, and learn useful skills applicable outside class

                      Cantrell assigns a LOT of reading (200 - 300 pages / week) and expects you to have it finished. However, you can skim through the reading and finish around 100 pages in 2 hours and still actually learn the content.  However, this is still significantly more work than any other English teacher. On the plus side, he does give out good grades.

                      Wade certainly garners mixed emotions.  The good: Very likable guy, great stories, clear explanations.  The Bad: Only graded assignment (14 page paper) is worth is 80% of grade, so it's a crap-shoot if you'll meet or miss his expectations.  Other 20% is participation, but no feedback during term.

                      High Level Overview: 1)He's a nice guy, if we walked into my bar I'd buy him a drink no questions asked. He has a million dog-bite stories, and I'd pay to hear more. (if fact, if you count tuition, I already did). As a professor, he gets too hung up on exactly recording the hour, minute, and second each student contributed. Overboard!

                      Do not take this professor. Extremely inflexible with regards to the schedules of working professionals in the Evening MBA program. He also changed the grading structure of our class two weeks before finals, assigning a major paper on top of the initial course requirements that were presented in the syllabus.

                      Professor Chumney is a very well-spoken, knowledgeable, and approachable individual. He explains topics very clearly, and as long as you listen to what he says, follow along in class, and read the appropriate chapters in the book, you will be adequately prepared.

                      Wade M. Chumney has done an impeccable job of conveying the material of business law to the entire class. He engages the entire class in relevant discussion and goes in depth with examples.

                      Chumney is one of the few great things about Belmont I will remember as I transfer. The key to success is to print off his presentations prior to class and take notes ON TOP OF the pre-written material. Then, before each of the 3 tests re-write EVERY word of the notes and memorize. GUARANTEED A+. This is coming from someone who earned a 102.

However, the prelab quizzes were outrageous and were weighted far too high for our grade imo. Also, there was a ton of work for the final project which made the class not seem like a 2 credit class.

                      I had Corsi at Emory this year and would not recommend taking her class. She made Calculus more complicated and confusing, as I didn't even need the course and could have used AP Credit. Her exams were not reflective of the material covered in class and it wasn't until the final that she gave us a practice exam that represented the material learned
                  </p>, <p class=""commentsParagraph"">
                      Corsi is friendly, but her lectures aren't the best. Too fast to understand material; posted slides aren't much help. Focuses on proofs, which can make it harder than other profs. I did most learning from textbook reading. Review sessions before midterms and final are great -- she takes the time to answer questions and explain how to find answer.

                      Good person but not a great teacher. Her classes are more formula oriented with very few examples. We would have to go through the entire book to prepare for the tests and her presentation slides or notes are not very helpful. Basically, you will end up studying the material on your own. On the bright side, she curves the class!

                      Under no circumstances should anyone ever take a class with Dr. Corsi. Corsi coves material that most other professors skip due to their difficulty (most other professors have a high B to low A student average, my class's average is about a 60). She does not know how to teach at all and so her lectures are horrible.

                      Most people find Phys2 pretty difficult, and that's going to be the case with any prof. Darnton is funny, easy to follow, and very willing to answer even the most basic questions in class or over email/in office hours. He would be my choice of Phys2 professors.

                      It isn't that he is difficult, it's that PHYS 2212 is difficult, plain and simple. Greco handles test making and gradin etc. so the only thing Darnton is responsible for is teaching his sections, of which he does a respectable job. No accents or mumbling or rushing to worry about here, just steady clean teaching. Wont get much better for 2212.

                      Physics 2 is inherently a hard class, but Darnton was good at lecturing about it. Homeworks were hard, and the tests were hard, but the lectures were somewhat lighthearted and he was good at giving you the information you needed to succeed.

                      Darnton is pretty funny and informal guy who formerly taught at UMass before this semester. He goes off on tangents during his long-winded, unnecessary lectures that do not prepare you for  tests. Attendance is monitored by clickers though. Stock up on all the word you can as tests closely resemble old tests.  Note that Greco admins the course.

                      It's fairly hard and a good amount of work but that's the nature of the course.  If you pay attention, read, and do the HW, you should be fine for an A, at least a B.  Tests are straightforward usually but that's done by Greco.  Not the best but would take again.  Attendance by clickers.

Test questions were barely harder than the  example problems he gave from the book (though the final was unnecessarily hard). He never tested over material that wasn't covered by the book examples.

                      Dorozhkin is the best prof. for ME 1770. The homework was time consuming, but he was an easy grader. If you show that you tried and meet all of the criteria you're basically guaranteed an A. He was funny in lecture and kept the environment light-hearted. Just take his class if you can. You won't regret it.

                      I loved this class and Dr. D. Super easy. All you have to do is the hw and show up. He just wants to see that you are trying. Not a super hard grader. Would definitely take him again.

                      Dr. D is really the best ME1770 professor. The assignments are easy to get full credit if you just meet the bare minimum he requires. The group project does have some stress but you will probably get a 100 on it. As long as you put in some effort, you will get an A. There are no tests or finals, just the group project presentation as a final.

He is super nice, super hilarious, super helpful, etc., etc. You do have a good bit of homework outside this class, but it is not difficult, just time consuming, but the CAD homework I really enjoyed.

                      Easy class if you put in the time and effort. He's very chill, but sometimes he seems a bit apathetic about the class. He doesn't do very much to make the material interesting, so I found the lectures boring most of the time, despite having mandatory attendance .

                      Dr. Dorozhkin is probably the easiest ME1770 professor. He is very chill and a very lenient grader (although the TAs grade your homework). He is also fairly humorous and incorporates some Russian humor into his lectures, but the material is still quite dry.

                      Dr. Dorozhkin made class fun with witty remarks and was very helpful with CAD... If you have experience with CAD, the lectures can be a little bit boring (I didn't really pay attention and still got an A). Most HW grades are based on your ability to follow the directions for sketching and CAD; for the individual/final project he doesn't grade harsh

                      Dr. Doyle tries to be relatable by playing music before class and passing out candy to those who choose the song correctly. It becomes clear fast that his efforts are being applied in the wrong place. He reads off his slides that look identical to the textbook and solves problems in a speedy yet monotonous fashion that doesn't really help anyone.

                      He has a lot of knowledge about the topics but had no passion in his presentation.

                      Doyle had a tendency to read off the projector and move past things before we got a chance to write everything down. I had to tag team each slide with the kid next to me. While Doyle was accessible during office hours, he rarely gave straightforward answers to questions. I have no doubt that he knows the material, he just can't explain it.

                      Professor Doyle covered the material adequately in class, but he basically just taught the textbook page by page. He taught in a manner that was conducive to a room of bodies that learn different ways, very generic, and only really connected to us in the morning song he played (and rewarded candy if you knew it). Mediocre teacher, great guy.

                      Doyle is a pretty decent professor. He isn't as good at explaining as Shepler is, but I found lectures very useful. The grading criteria for the class is very clear.

His course structure was logical in its sequece, his lectures well planned and his style clear with excellent examples worked in class. Plus he's thoroughly entertaining. I thought the class was easier, but I didn't give him a 5 because he grades dumb mistakes strictly on hw and tests.

Reading the textbook is a much better use of your time then going to lecture, which is just a less clear explanation of something the textbook covers. If anything, use lecture as a litmus test to see how well you understand a topic you studied before hand, not a learning tool.

                      Marty is an awesome person and is very entertaining to listen too. He is pretty good at explaining the calculus stuff, but not as good at explaining the linear algebra. His tests were EXTREMELY difficult. We got extra credit on the first test, but only on the first test. The averages were all C's or failing, but he doesn't curve AT ALL.

                      Marty is a really cool guy, and I really liked him as a person, but as a teacher...His tests were difficult and he DOES NOT curve. He grades on a weird scale by adding up total points. I attended every lecture and I ended up only a few points from a B, because the third test and the final were both terrible (really bad averages!).

                      Worst physics professor ever. All of his tests were MULTIPLE CHOICE (i.e. no partial credit!) with SIX questions!

                      The class itself (Intro modern) was pathetically easy and shallow. Prof Erbil, however, is an incredibly passionate guy who clearly would have loved to just teach to anyone who wanted to learn, even without requirements/grades/external motivators. Seems to me he wants to go into more depth than the course allowed. He seems like a really cool guy.

                      I had Erbil for Physics 3. Physics 3 is much easier than Physics 2, and unfortunately he realizes this. Unlike Physics 1 and 2 where the worst test is dropped as a buffer, in his Physics 3 class there is NO hope of redemption after a bad test grade. The final was 10 MC at 25% of your grade: one stupid math error drops your final grade 2.5 points.

                      He's an awesome guy, super nice and funny. His class should be an easy A if you look over words on the study guide he posts and attend lecture.
                  </p>, <p class=""commentsParagraph"">
                      He was an awesome professor. It was very clear what was going to be on tests. He was very open and fair in terms of going through tests and regrading. Just a top of the notch good guy who cared about his topic matter and the students. Super inspirational. Our last day of class he gave like a mini speech encouraging the class...I shed a few tears

                      Dr. Flamming is one of the teachers who will always have a place in my heart. His story telling and excellent sketches made the class interesting (history was my least favorite so well done), and he always dressed up sharp!
                  </p>, <p class=""commentsParagraph"">
                      3 Tests, each 33% of your grade, each test is 50% lecture material and 50% textbook memorization. Textbook notes are easy, lecture notes are from his lectures obviously, and Prof. Flamming is hilarious and engaging so the lectures are worth going to. Amazing teacher for (likely) your last history class.
                  </p>, <p class=""commentsParagraph"">
                      Prof. Flamming is one of the best professors I've ever had. He is a fantastic storyteller and brings history to life in his lectures. I looked forward to going to his lectures every week. He is also very encouraging and believes in his students. His class is really easy, as your grade is just based on three easy MC tests, but you will learn alot.
                  </p>, <p class=""commentsParagraph"">
                      Flamming is the best teacher I have ever had in my entire life. Enough Said
                  </p>, <p class=""commentsParagraph"">
                      Flamming is a passionate and funny professor. He makes lectures interesting and tells funny stories. If you show up to most lectures and pay some level of attention you will do fine. 3 tests, including 1 non cumulative final. 50 MC questions, half from book half from lecture. Study guide includes all terms from book so no need to read whole chapt

                      Really passionate and caring professor. Tests are really easy.

                      Flamming is a great guy and terrific storyteller with history. Stays relatively on topic and you'll learn a lot. Tests are multiple choice, half on textbook half on lecture. Only hw is the textbook readings which are long but you can scan for the list of terms he gives you (and review them before test). Very easy test and then gave extra credit.
                  </p>, <p class=""commentsParagraph"">
                      If you have to take history, definitely take it with Flamming! His lectures were always great and he told so many funny stories throughout the semester. There are only 3 tests but as long as you do the reading and go to each lecture, you'll be fine.
                  </p>, <p class=""commentsParagraph"">
                      Dr. Flamming is passionate about history, extremely knowledgeable, entertaining (you'll hear a few great stories), &amp; loves teaching us. He also believes in his students. Three exams are 50% lecture and 50% book (reading isn't that bad, and he gives a list of terms that are fair game). So if you missed APUSH credit, don't fret - this class is great!

                      Easy A for American students who have always been studying this same history.  Otherwise, you'll still get an A because it's just memorize the terms.

                      Great Professor, gives great lectures and a lot of extra credit opportunities to help you do well. Only downside is that the class was only three tests, each a third of your grade, so you have to make sure you do well on them. Favorite professor at Tech so far though, you will do well in his class if you show up to lectures.

                      Extremely funny and actually made history enjoyable, which allowed me to learn a lot more. Tests were all multiple choice, with half on textbook terms on assigned reading, half on his lectures. Pretty easy, and definitely fun.
                  </p>, <p class=""commentsParagraph"">
                      Lectures are 50% of the tests while the textbook is the other. The lectures were amazing. I was never a fan of history but he made me actually want to go to lecture. He made everything clear cut and entertaining,  and you could see his enthusiasm for the class. The tests were very clear cut. I'd take this class again if I could.
                  </p>, <p class=""commentsParagraph"">
                      Best professor I've had at Tech thus far. Definitely going to take another class of his if possible. Very straight-forward; 3 tests each worth 1/3 of grade (50% lecture material &amp; 50% textbook material). Textbook material is all from a study guide too. Lectures are actually interesting- he's pretty funny and actually cares about his students.

                      Dr. Fletcher clearly loves teaching Psychology. He's young so it is easy for him to relate to students and come up with relevant examples in order to make material more understandable. Tests are hard but there are lots of fluff points. GO TO OFFICE HOURS, will answer any questions. Also, review the midterm, half the final is verbatim from midterm.

                      Super funny guy, and one of the kindest profs I've had. Go to office hours &amp; be honest, he wants to see you succeed. Lectures are important, and there's a weekly participation grade. Grades are very spread out, so it's easy to recover from any bad marks. Tests can be difficult, definitely focus on making examples, not just studying definitions.

                      Very relatable. Tests based on textbook but he knows that most people won't read so if you take notes in class you'll be fine, unless he specifically says to read a certain chapter. Weekly assignments as a grade buffer. Make sure to review the midterm for the final. Class not mandatory but he does random graded attendance checks often.
                  </p>, <p class=""commentsParagraph"">
                      Lectures are usually pretty engaging and he really knows what he's talking about. There is usually two or more 10 point assignments a week, there are a lot of buffer points. His tests are pretty challenging, but if you understand the material you can do well. There is also small extra credit assignments throughout the semester.

                      An amazing lecturer with a sharp wit. Tests are fair and not difficult if you prepare, but may not be as easy as you expect. That being said, there's lots of ""fluffy"" points, so getting a good grade in this class is not difficult. Grades aside, I left this class with a much greater appreciation for psychology. And I never once got bored in class.

                      Keaton Fletcher is a fantastic lecturer. Classroom discussion is always very interesting and engaging. Attendance is not mandatory per se, but there are in class assignments that are only accessible during lecture which can impact your grade if missed. He offers ample opportunities for grade improvement via extra credit.

                      Clearly knows the material, but has been late or missed class altogether a few times. Much of this class is conceptual or theory based, which makes it a little bit harder to put together when tests and quizzes roll around.

                      this was the best class ever. attendance wasnt even counted but it was still the only class i was always actually excited about going to. benji turns architecture and art into this deep philosophical class wide discussion and its so awesome and i would take it 100 times if i could

                      I actually enjoyed coming to class to hear Benji's lectures. He made everything interesting, and really reminded me why I picked my major. There aren't too many assignments, and the tests are all memorization (and based off lectures). He'll make the class as enjoyable as possible, even if it is just about buildings.
                  </p>, <p class=""commentsParagraph"">
                      Benji is simply the GOAT. He gives the best lectures, and even though they are not mandatory, everyone shows up. The tests are a lot of memorization, but nothing too bad. He will keep you engaged for the whole semester and he has the best stories.

                      Extremely engaging lectures! The best professor i have had at Tech so far. However the tests and quizzes are 98% based on lectures so just make sure to show up and pay attention. He also says he requires books however i never opened any of them so my recommendation is don't get them if you plan on showing up to class.

                      Benjy is awesome! His lectures and assignments are a bit ""off the wall"", but are really interesting and designed to make you think. He really cares about what you learn, not grades, so he tries to do everything he can to make the class not about grades. There was only 3 easy assignments including the final, so make sure to do your best on each one.
                  </p>, <p class=""commentsParagraph"">
                      Benji Flowers is without a doubt one of the best. He has an ability to make the concepts very easy to understand; he has a great passion for architecture. He wont let you fail

                      Best best best professor ever!  Although attendance isn't mandatory, I'd definitely recommend attending lectures just because the way he delivers the course materials is very interesting &amp; enjoyable, u'll learn more than just architecture.  He's an easy grader, so long as you memorize what he tells you to study, you'll pass with an A.
                  </p>, <p class=""commentsParagraph"">
                      Hands down the best professor I had.  Attendance is not mandatory for this class, but Professor Flowers' lectures are definitely worth to attend. Your grade for this class consisted of 3 quiz, 2 test, a digital journal assignment and a final. He drops 1 lowest quiz grade and students are allow to exempt out of the final.
                  </p>, <p class=""commentsParagraph"">
                      He is the best professor I've ever had. Incredibly passionate and candid about architecture and also just hilarious. He's one of the main reasons I haven't dropped my major yet.

                      Benji is the best! His lectures are so informative and are super interesting. He will make you think about doors and windows and everyday objects in completely new ways. The class content is always enjoyable and the readings aren't bad at all. 10/10 would recommend.

                      Benjy is a truly fantastic prof. His lectures are informative, relevant, and interesting. He does not have an attendance policy, but everyone still comes to class because his lectures are so amazing. The projects do not require a lot of time, but they do require a substantial amount of thought.

                      Entertaining, funny, informative lectures (PPT's only). Be ready to memorize the names, dates, locations, styles, etc. of literally hundreds of buildings/paintings. Essay portions of tests are surprisingly difficult. Beware this class takes up a ton of time. He posts online what to study for the final, but will test you partly on other material.

                      Class with unrealistic expectations of content than students need to memorize. The goal of this memorization is unclear. Tests are tricky.

                      One of the least inspiring educators ever encountered. Confrontational when challenged by students on his methods. Relies entirely on memorization as a form of learning. Material is not organized to promote synthesis. Rather, everything is a jumble of partially related facts whose relationships are not explained clearly. Avoid him and his class.

                      Class was really boring, but he took attendance, so you had to go.

                      Dr. Foley really cares about students. He's not that great of a lecturer and his notes are sometimes confusing, but he gives you a lot of homework and tests you over similar concepts. He grades on a curve. I ended up with a grade much higher than I was expecting because of how I was doing so poorly. So I'm definitely glad I took him.
                  </p>, <p class=""commentsParagraph"">
                      Dr. Foley is an excellent professor. His homeworks are time-consuming and difficult, however, they're helpful and the grading is lenient. His exam questions are basically an extension of what you've already done. Use recent past exams and homeworks to study for his exams. Lectures are disorganized, but he's happy to stop and explain whenever.

                      Dr. Foley is a great professor who really wants you to do well. You'll most likely do poorly on every test, but you'l most likely end up with a B in the class. The class isn't that time consuming, and the homework is helpful. Go to office hours. An A is attainable so don't use his GPA as an excuse to be lazy.

                      Dr. Foley is awesome. He's a great guy. You will end up with a B in the class NO MATTER WHAT. Keep that in mind. He's a stickler for his GPA, so he legit rounds at least 90% of the class down/up to a B. So don't worry if you are sitting at a 50 or 60 in the class. You're fine. HW is difficult. Find old HWs. Practice old tests.

However, the lectures can be a bit unorganized at times, and the tests do not have partial credit, so do not be alarmed by your low test score, there is a curve. Also make sure to start homework early, it is long and an important part of your grade.

                      Spent a lot of time studying for this class, but often was disappointed by results on tests (short answer math, no partial credit). Homeworks take hours to complete, and it is difficult to prepare for tests because he doesn't give answers to practice tests. Great lecturer, answers questions; if you put in effort, expect a B.

Homework is very tedious but tests are easier. He likes to keep the average GPA between 2.9 and 3.0, so that's how the curve will be determined.

                      You can skip all the classes and get a B for this course. Entire grade is based on 3 exams and an optional final.

Each exam is 40 questions multiple choice format and since there is no homework you need to get over 3640 in each exam to make an A.

                      Proffessor Gangbo is a very smart man. Unfortunately for all of us, that is a very bad thing. If you come into this class with no background in calculus, you will have an extremely hard time passing this class.  He's very hard to understand, doesn't care too much for what is the cultural norm, and has rough tests. Curves, but still difficult

                      He really really knows his stuff. But he almost knows it too well, he basically teaches in proofs and can't explain things in simple terms. If you don't have much background knowledge of the stuff, you will be lost quickly. His tests are very hard, but he curves. Overall, I don't recommend taking him unless you don't have any other choice.

                      Took him for Honors Cal II. He is a very, very intelligent man, but has difficulty explaining things to those of lower intellect. Difficult to understand speech, but very legible and thorough explanation in writing. Homework has little correlation to class material.

                      Gangbo is the most worthless prof at Tech. He's arrogant, cold, and incomprehensible. He is out to get the students, to trap and spite them, plain and simple. He is even culturally insensitive, to the point of giving a pop quiz the day before Thanksgiving just to keep us American students stuck at school. Worst teacher I've ever had or ever will.

                      Gangbo is a smart man that cannot teach. He explains something with proofs, then tells you after the proofs what he was trying to explain. You get the hang of the teaching, but I recommend choosing a different teacher. Attendance not mandatory, but random pop quizzes. grades= few pop quiz + like 3 tests. Managed a B.

                      Terrible lecturer. The man really knew his stuff, but nothing would get through his accent. Often used pauses for ridiculous amounts of time as ""dramatic effect"". Tests were really not that bad if you studied, but with no homework, few in-class example problems, and no appearance of caring for his students, barely anyone had a prayer of passing.

                      Knows his stuff, but is not a good teacher.  He is foreign and it is very hard to understand what he is saying.  Tests were sometimes straightforward and sometimes not.

                      Don't reccommend taking him.  Never fully explained things and hard to understand (accent).  Would tell you what something was and then did examples.  The only reason I passed my class was cuz of an awesome TA.

                      Garmestani really cares about his students. His course is relatively easy, as most of his assessments don't require a great understanding of MSE, just the ability to memorize past questions. I highly recommend him if you simply need to get an A, but he's not the best at teaching so I don't recommend him if you want to actually learn the material.

                      Professor Garmestani seems to be very caring and understands that we as students can't spend all of our time on one class. He makes tests very doable (majority of the questions come from past tests) and curves so that the average is a high B. There are pop quizzes every class and chapter quizzes so attending lecture is a must.

                      The tests were not too bad as they were mostly questions from previous exams. Lab reports were very annoying to write but the TA's were generous with grading. He is not very accessible outside class. He took attendance with clicker quizzes so you have to go to class

                      He's a lecturer, but definitely not a teacher. He didn't explain anything and half the things he said contradicted what was on the powerpoints. He never explained what it would take to succeed in the class. Everything was memorization. He did not test our understanding, only our ability to remember facts. Easiest class you'll ever get a B in.

                      The lectures are clear and I actually enjoyed going.  while there are 2-3 pop clicker quizzes per class, they're easy to ace if you were paying attention. The tests are mostly recycled questions from the quizzes and it's difficult to do well. When I took it during the summer, he said he wouldn't curve as the vast majority would receive As or Bs.

                      I think the best aspect of this course were the clicker question quizzes. They gave us hints for what was going to be on the tests, as well as kept us engaged.

His lack of example problems and use of strictly variables and math notation doesn't help either.  You need either a good TA, or a patience to watch khan academy.

The main issue is that he teaches things one way in class, the book will explain them another way, and then the TA often does it a third way, so it gets confusing. He's a little difficult to follow, but he gives practice tests that make the actual tests much easier.

                      The design of the course was not to my liking-- it's a half-flipped classroom, with lots of worksheets and small group activities and only ""mini-lectures"", which wasn't particularly helpful for me. Expect a lot of time studying on your own to do well on tests. That said, Dr. Green was helpful and approachable and offered plenty of extra credit.

                      The worksheets during class are not helpful at all and waste precious class time. Her PowerPoint presentations are not detailed enough for you to study those alone. I would recommend taking notes in class along side the printed-out PowerPoint slides and then reading the book as well. MC is really hard, but the short-answer isn't graded too hard.

                      Amazing Professor!!! The first few days it was hard to understand because of his thick accent however, eventually it was understandable.

                      Rui Han was great. He was more than willing to meet with me at times separate from his office hours to go over old tests and homework problems. He is quick to explain a concept twice if need be and seems to genuinely care about his students success.

                      Posts complete lecture slides so that we can soak in what we're learning instead of frantically copying everything. He does exam review in lectures. Before the final, he made outlines on exactly what we needed to know. Not intimidating (an important quality for a professor to have). Has an accent, but it does not inhibit understanding at all.

                      Han is one of the better professors for this subject. His tests and quizzes make sense, and go along with the material well. You get unlimited tries for the homework, and if you turn it in late it's 10% off total. So if you're a day late or a week late, it's a 90% max. The class' tests averaged around a B each time.

                      He allows you a a sheet of notes for each exam AND the option to write a 2 page summary of an economics article for 7 bonus points. Final is optional and the online homework is more than manageable. I finished with an A (which you only need an 88 to do) without going to class. Just read the chapters and do the practice tests before each exam.

His lectures give a lot of good examples for the tests and quizzes.

                      Iliev was a great teacher. He really knew his stuff and could express it well in lecture. First math class here I have actually understood the concepts of. Tests were difficult but mirrored the homework and in class examples very closely. Very easy to talk to and is willing to take time and help his students. I Highly Recommend Iliev.

                      Hard tests and loved taking examples from the book as a surprise on the test. TA's were not helpful and were students driven. B average on tests, B on final, and C on quizes and finished with a A as final grade. To get an A in the class you just have to score in the top 20% of your class

                      Prof Illiev is difficult, but he's not unreasonable. He always seemed approachable and you can tell he wants his students to do well. Test averages were fairly low (~55), while quizzes were slightly higher (~70). He does curve at the end though. I did about average and received a C. (50 test avg, 75 quiz avg).

                      Very hard...his tests were too long and the problems were too difficult.  Assumes that you already know much of the material...and isn't super lenient on grades.

                      His tests are hard, but he isn't unreasonable. I recommend teaching yourself from the book because he goes pretty quickly in lecture and expects that you remember doing things from calc1. He does occasionally do problems in class that are identical/similar but more complicated than problems that will be on your test.

                      Coming from someone who has never done any Calculus whatsoever prior to coming here, it was hard. The first few chapters he will definitely fly by but will eventually slow down. If you put some effort, you can pass. Curves massively at the end of the year.

                      I didn't take Calculus in high school so the class was more of a challenge than most people. Overall, you can do well in this class. You have weekly quizzes in recitation. If you keep up with these quizzes the tests shouldn't be hard to study for and the final should just be a review. It is very possible to do well in this class

                      His class was fun at time yet the tests are extremely hard.  There are weekly quizzes in recitation so you are able to test your knowledge of the material,and this year he dropped 1 of the quizzes.  Overall if you study hard you should do well in this class the professor knows what he is talking about and can help if you talk to him.

                      Pretty difficult. I took Calc 1 before coming here, just not AP and everything was different. Im not a big fan of his teaching method; he moves through everything fast on the board so you better be able to keep up. Plus its pretty much the only Calc 1 class that doesnt get cheat sheets for tests and the final. Id recommend finding another teacher.

                      Very hard--even though I understood what he was saying I didn't understand what he was trying to teach us. Its more helpful to just go to your recitation. Its a good idea to go to lecture so that you know what you should be learning though. Iliev is really hot though.

                      A wonderful professor. Go to the review sessions! It clears things up. And do lots and lots and lots of practice with old exams. He is very helpful and very clear about what you'll be expected to know. If you have an A by the final you'll be exempt from it too, so try to get that!
                  </p>, <p class=""commentsParagraph"">
                      Lectures are done on the board &amp; his notes get VERY messy by the end of lecture. His redeeming quality is that he holds weekly review sessions. However, if you get lost in class, and can't make it to a review session you're in trouble. Not particularly helpful during office hours. Also a plus, he posts all of his old tests online for extra study.

                      Seriously, Jacobs is a fantastic professor. He definitely lives up to the hype and I HIGHLY recommend taking him if you have the chance. I hate 8AMs as much as the next person, but Jacobs makes it worth it. He's super energetic, has review sessions every Wednesday, and will tell you what's on the test in class. Also, he loves the word ""rhombus.""

                      Great professor but underestimating the material will earn you a bad grade so go to class and do the HW

                      EXCELLENT professor!  He's so energetic, even at 8am, that it makes you want to learn the material.  It's obvious how much he cares about his students and how much he wants us to learn and appreciate the material as much as he does.  Seriously, take him if you have the opportunity!  (also...he has a final exam exemption option if you have an A)

                      Definitely lives up to his hype. This man is a god among engineering professors. Makes an effort to learn your name and actually cares about how you do. He explains material very well and made all lectures fun and engaging. I wish he would teach all the engineering courses at Tech. Definitely one of the best teachers I've ever had.

                      Amazing teacher. Learns everyone's name. Teaches hard concepts well. Keeps lecture so interesting that attendance is very high even for an 8am 1.5 class. Take his class if you have the chance.

                      Dr. Jacobs expertly designed her lectures and assignments. Each reading assignment tied perfectly into lecture and our discussions were exciting. There were times when I had to call home to tell my dad about whatever we talked about in class that day. She is a tough grader but has a revision policy. Take her class if you want to learn something.
                  </p>, <p class=""commentsParagraph"">
                      Professor Jacobs cares so much about her students, from extending deadlines if you are having a hard time to addressing the well-being of all her students. She is very passionate about her class material and is sure to pass that onto you, her course including things from classic sci-fi to Beyonce. You do need to put a lot of effort into your work.
                  </p>, <p class=""commentsParagraph"">
                      In the classroom, Dr. Jacobs was fantastic. We had some profound conversations on enlightening topics. Unfortunately, I was weighed down with group projects that never seemed to get the grade that matched my effort. She does give some extra credit at the very beginning and end of the semester. Only take her if you have a light course load.
                  </p>, <p class=""commentsParagraph"">
                      HER CLASS is difficult
                  </p>, <p class=""commentsParagraph"">
                      Dr. Jacobs sets a tone for how class is. She wants you to attend and participate. The class material is unique, i.e. Afrofuturism in Beyonce's Lemonade (-: . Class discussions take up most of the time, are somewhat intense but are inclusive and open-minded. Tough grader, yes - but she offers revisions so it's fair. Overall, a decent teacher.
                  </p>, <p class=""commentsParagraph"">
                      Lectures were always very interesting. She can sometimes be a tough grader, but she wants you to succeed. If you take her class, make sure you show her that you are trying by participating in class and/or visiting office hours. Class composed of 3 group projects and 1 independent. Even though I got a C, I would definitely take her class again.
                  </p>, <p class=""commentsParagraph"">
                      Class topic is very interesting and enlightening; all group projects except for one, and she expects you to pull your weight and come up with some original ideas
                  </p>, <p class=""commentsParagraph"">
                      It was difficult to figure out what Dr. Jacobs wanted from me (or from my group) without going to her office hours. She favors those who contribute frequently in class discussions so get ready to participate and work ahead. In addition, expect to work for an A; without her revision policy, I wouldn't even have been close to getting an A.
                  </p>, <p class=""commentsParagraph"">
                      The course content is enlightening and Dr. Jacobs is both knowledgeable and passionate about it. She gives great feedback and is very helpful during office hours. However, the grading is frustratingly harsh compared to the majority of English classes at Tech and it is intimidating to express a conflicting opinion in class.
                  </p>, <p class=""commentsParagraph"">
                      She's a tough grader. It's really hard to get an A, so if you are not linguistically gifted, don't take her class. That aside, her class is pretty interesting. Her lectures were pretty cool, but her grading seemed really random at times. She can be very moody, and that definitely plays a role in her grading.
                  </p>, <p class=""commentsParagraph"">
                      Dr. Jacobs is definitely a harder professor/grader when it comes to English 1102. If you had IB Literature HL in high school, expect the difficulty to be about the same. If you're interested in the topic, the class is cool. It was one of my most interesting and enjoyable classes this semester. Know you'll have to work hard for an A. It's possible!!
                  </p>, <p class=""commentsParagraph"">
                      If youre interested in the topic Dr. Jacob's is teaching and are willing to work harder to take a more interesting class I'd say go for it. She really knows her stuff and as someone who was interested in this semester's topic, I found it to be my most interesting class. However its not an easy class and sometimes her expectations are unclear.
                  </p>, <p class=""commentsParagraph"">
                      If you thoroughly enjoy constant vulgarity, arbitrary grading, and very controversial conversation, you'll enjoy this class. As someone who agrees more with conservative views, I couldn't speak up in class. When I expressed my feelings about a project, she smiled in person, but then she deducted points. If you take her class, you can't trust her.
                  </p>, <p class=""commentsParagraph"">
                      Dr. Jacobs is extremely enthusiastic about the topic: African American Rhetorics of Resistance. She taught a potentially controversial class in a respectful, open-minded manner. If you are used to being babied by your high school teachers, this is not the class for you. There is occasional swearing - it can be an intense class. Tough grading!!
                  </p>, <p class=""commentsParagraph"">
                      Doctor Bethany Jacobs is a professor that believes no one can be perfect, so no one will be getting a high A. She will find something wrong with your paper. She also strongly believes in the use of group projects, which means you constantly are dealing with social loafing and team member arguments. She is more rude over email than in person.
                  </p>, <p class=""commentsParagraph"">
                      Dr. Jacobs treats her class very professionally (such as by responding to emails quickly and always being prepared for class) and was highly knowledgeable about my class's topic of black science fiction. I found her lectures and discussions interesting and her grading fair. The works we read in the class were very unique and quite intriguing!

                      She is very unorganized. Often forgets about assignments and seems to even forget her feedbacks from last time. She was good at giving critique. She expects that the students be on top of their assignments when she herself is not. The students were always confused about what's next. In summary, very unorganized.

                      She's a nice person and the class is easy if you are willing to put some effort into it. Her lectures are typically interesting and she uses a good mix of videos and powerpoint slides. Tests are fair and straightforward but you'd need to study a bit.

                      Young grad student who understands the undergrad struggle and is very passionate about her field. She lays out the expectations day 1 which makes keeping track of work easy. Overall easy class, although the tests can be a little tricky.

                      Dr. Jakacki is cool, very passionate about the topics she teaches! Very sympathetic and loves to get to know the students more. She's an easy grader as well. Take her!! I didn't have to do much work and still got A.

                      Dr. J was a pretty cool teacher. I didn't read any of the books and still escaped with an A. However, if you do read the books I'd imagine the class being much, much easier. I recommend the class because she really tries to get you interested in the topic. She'll make your final English class enjoyable.

                      Dr. Jakacki is awesome! You can tell that she is really passionate about the things that she teaches, and that makes it interesting. She's a really nice lady, very helpful and understanding. She genuinely cares. Her assignments are fairly easy. I love this class. Highly recommended.

                      Dr. Jakacki was actually interested in the topic, and really wanted us to succeed. I would definitely recommend her, but don't be fooled, it's not an easy A class. You do have to do some work.

                      Dr. Jakacki's class was quite easy, and she really does try to make the class fun while teaching relevant information. However, I still don't think that I learned anything from this class. She does have a bad habit of picking on favorites. Basically, if you can use image processing software, you'll get an A.

                      Professor Jakacki was awesome! Her classes were a lot of fun and the class material was very interesting. She treats students very well and is very understanding. I really enjoyed her class and would recommend it to anyone.

                      I had him for the summer semester. We had three tests and the professor basically gave us the main topics we should study. Also do the hw, almost the exact same, if not the same question will be on the test.
                  </p>, <p class=""commentsParagraph"">
                      First test is going to be very easy and he starts by giving out lots of extra credits before you are able to drop the class. When the drop period passes, things begin to change dramatically. Barely any extra credits in class. Would not recommend him.

                      This class was awesome. He is funny and makes the material interesting. I had him for the summer semester. We had 3 tests, which if you showed up to class and did the homework were almost guaranteed A's. Learned a lot and wasn't too difficult.

                      Took MSE with professor Jang during summer semester. The grades are only made up of 3 tests and I did poorly on one so I got a B. But if you go to every class (he tells you what is on the test) and do the homeworks (usually exact questions on test) there's no reason why you shouldn't do well :) He's also a really funny guy, who really cares!

                      He's really funny and puts powerpoints online. Go to class to get the extra stuff and do the homework because it IS the test. He loves having people come to his office hours and I would get him for 2001 if I were you.

                      A textbook is assigned, but he recommends that you not bother buying it. He's funny with a comprehensible accent. Go to lecture so you don't miss the extra stuff he says that's not on the power point notes. (It will be on the test!) Tests are DIRECTLY from the homework, so a B is effortless and an A requires minimal effort. Get him if you can!

                      Prof Jang consistently goes out of his way to help students. The tests are fair and only over material we have thoroughly covered. I came into his class with 0 previous knowledge and now I'm going to Korea within the year all thanks to what I learned in this class. Be prepared to study. The language can be tricky but the instruction is very clear.

                      Professor Jang is a great teacher who cares about students' learning. Attendance is check every day and homework is due almost every class period, but it is worth it! The learning material is more difficult than what I anticipated, but I learned a lot and was really happy about his teaching style. Study often and it will be easy to get an A.

                      Professor Jang is a wonderful instructor.  He genuinely cares about the success of his students and makes perfectly clear his expectations regarding what one must do to make an A. As long as you attend lecture (attendance is mandatory and checked daily) and read the book, you will do well.  Homework is important.  Late work will hurt your grade.

                      he is worth the 8am. clear, thorough, helpful lectures. linear algebra is a very conceptual class, but between jankowski and the textbook, I understood all the concepts I need for the exams. quizzes are very straightforward, exams are a little more difficult, but examples done in class are helpful. one of the best linear algebra profs here.
                  </p>, <p class=""commentsParagraph"">
                      Jankowski is one of the best (along with Margalit) for 1553. His lectures are super helpful (you can miss 3), but a lot of it is on you to learn/master. Homework is due every Wednesday and quizzes are every Friday. Each midterm is 15% of your grade, &amp; the final is 30%, which was bad and dropped my grade by a letter. You're gonna have to work hard.

                      Despite him having class at 8 am, Jankowski proved to be a solid choice for Linear Algebra. His lectures are so clear and concise, and he can explain the material well. He is truly a god for Linear Algebra.

                      His lectures are great; I even have friends that wake up for his 8 AMs that aren't registered. He paces himself well and clarifies any questions. You don't have to go to class except for the occasional in-class poll (3 get dropped, 5% of grade). Quizzes are pretty easy (1 gets dropped), and midterms are fair (but slightly harder than other profs).

                      Dr. Jankowski truly cares about his students and wants them to succeed. Linear Algebra is a hard class so you will need to work hard for it, but Jankowski makes it understandable. He's a little awkward socially but he is a great lecturer and easily accessible outside of class.
                  </p>, <p class=""commentsParagraph"">
                      Jankowski's course is very lecture heavy, but his lectures were inclusive, thorough, and he even provided great exam related problems. Quizzes were okay - if you studied - and exams were a tad bit more difficult, but if you want a professor who'll actually stimulate your interest in linear algebra, go Jankowski.

                      Professor Jankowski is a great professor. He's knowledgeable, and his lectures are helpful. He moves quickly, so be prepared. If you need someone to teach you Linear Algebra, take Jankowski! If you ever are confused or stuck on a problem, he is very approachable and will help during office hours or after class. Go to lecture and do the homework!

                      He is a good lecturer, organized and clear. but when it comes to the time when you have to encounter him individually (either when you just say hi or when you walked into his office hour) he becomes a super awkward guy. and office hour is not helpful. he would touch your question but never actually answer the question.
                  </p>, <p class=""commentsParagraph"">
                      Loved taking 2550 with him. Really helpful whenever anyone asked a question, and I actually understood the topic after he taught it (sat in on other 2550 professors and didn't understand at all). He's super structured and organized. Wish every professor was like him.

                      Prof. Jankowski is a hilarious professor who knows a lot about linear algebra. His quizzes are fairly easy, tests are slightly harder, but if you study the quizzes and homework ahead of time, you should do well. MATH 1553 also has a hearty curve, so it is very easy to get an A in the class.

                      Jarrio was a decent professor for the first two units (kinematics and forces), but for the last units (torque, etc), the class became suddenly more difficult. For the first two exams, I redid the HW, and I got As, but the last ones were nothing like the HWs, and his lectures weren't as good. Using the book kind of helps. He can be rude at times.

                      Jarrio makes PHYS understandable, even if you had little to no physics before GT. Lectures &amp; (sometimes tricky) clicker questions cover book material -- do assigned reading before class. Jarrio's sarcastic humor can seem condescending but it's not too mean. Do HW before next class for 40% bonus. Practice tests great to prepare for midterms/final.

                      This is my second review on Jarrio because the first one was magically deleted... Jarrio is very challenged and picky with notation. He can be rude during office hours when asked questions. Tests are extremely challenging, pay attention to lecture examples and DO THE HW EARLY! Overall, I would not recommend Jarrio. Take modern, tests are easier.

                      Dr. Jarrio is a great professor overall. As far as physics lectures go, his are really engaging, but you have to make sure you are paying attention to the whole lecture or you will miss something critical. Jerry will teach you everything you need to know, but you will have to work for your grade. Tip: Do your homework early for extra credit.

                      Jarrio is a great lecturer. He really seemed to care about the content, despite he fact that it was only intro level Physics. It was tough to get an A, but completely fair. Go to class, do all the homework, and work the practice tests he posts. If you do that you should be fine. Highly recommend.

                      I have taken IB Physics SL with a solid professor, and this class made me work to the bitter end. For Dr. Jarrio you need to sit up front for and take notes, go to him for help on HW and read. Tests ask for a lot in short time, get good at algebraic manipulations with letters only, and get extra time if you need. Jarrio is hard at first but fun.

                      Great Professor overall. I felt like he lectures well, and really devoted his time in office hours and making students feel like they are able to receive help. Tests were challenging across all PHYS2211 classes, and Jarrio could be picky about applying certain concepts and showing it in your work on tests. DO YOUR HOMEWORK EARLY for extra credit.

                      Dr. Jarrio taught everything in class as clearly as it gets in a large lecture hall. The homework and tests were nonstop and I was sustained mostly by in-depth readings of the textbook. Definitely do your homework early (extra 2%!) and read the textbook, preferably before class. Get ready for lots of clicker questions, too.

                      I spent the most time and effort on practicing the concepts for this class for my grade not to reflect my efforts. Didn't understand his lectures as he would often go on tangents and write stuff on the board and explain too quickly/skip over explanation. Clicker questions are difficult but reading the book helps. A lot of time spent on homework

                      Jarrio is a great lecturer and he is extremely passionate about the subject and teaching. He is also genuinely interested in your success in the class. If you read the text, do all of the homework, and go to class there is no reason why you won't do well.

                      Physics at Georgia Tech is hard regardless of who you take, but Jarrio is a good professor. Attendance is a MUST but makes lectures as fun as he can. Always willing to help &amp; answer questions, but he &amp; his TAs are tough/nitpicky with how he grades your tests and recitations. If you do all extra credit and homework he's known to round grades too.

                      He's an excellent teacher, but makes you work to do well. Does a lot of very hard clicker questions, but really drills home the key ideas. Very nitpicky, so be careful on tests. Go to every class, pay attention, do as much HW as you can &amp; buck up on your symbolic algebra &amp; you should be OK. Prior physics experience will go a long way in this class.

                      Probably my favorite class at Tech. It's problem solving masked as e/mag. Just do the HW and go to class (he's honestly pretty entertaining dude). He definitely has high expectations for students which is refreshing.

                      Physics II is a very hard class in general, but Jarrio puts all the tough concepts into understandable English terms. He is very passionate about the subject and teaches you the problem solving process very well. Read the textbook before class, practice old multiple choice questions and FRQs, and pay attention in lecture and you'll be fine.

                      This is perhaps the best class I've taken. You can go at your own pace, and you cannot receive less than a one hundred on any homework assignment unless you give up.

                      Just to provide a different insight to this class, if you are serious about pursuing CS you shouldn't take the online class.

I felt super unprepared when moving on to 1331.

                      She gives very little mandatory homework, there are attendance quizzes. She does go a little fast but is very understanding and stops for questions frequently. Recitation is important, but optional. She'll curve specific quizzes and test forms.

                      Kang is an amazing lecturer but her class is hard. The tests and quizzes are similar to the optional homework but Kang is EXTREMELY helpful in office hours. I spent a lot of my time in office hours and she is one of the most caring people I have ever met. I do recommend her just be prepared to do a lot of homework problems.
                  </p>, <p class=""commentsParagraph"">
                      Kang isn't that bad for DIFF EQ. For some reason the average on the first test was in the 50s... People obviously don't know how to do their homework and study. If you ask your TA for help, do the homework, and study a week before each test, you'll ace it. It's simply just following the same steps to answer a question, like all diff eq.

                      She truly cares for her students and wants to make sure everyone learns the material. That said, do not be surprised when you make a 49% on the first test which can be quite disheartening... This semester she allowed grade replacement with the final which was super helpful! The best advice I an give you is to go to ALL of her office hours.

                      Test average can get down to mid 40s, her lecture goes super fast and it's very hard to understand and follow. I agree that you can learn a lot of things in her class, but I don't think it's fair for most students to get a low grade with the amount of effort put in. Don't take her unless you don't have other time-consuming courses.

                      There's no doubt that she cares about each student individually and wants everyone to succeed in her class. However, her lectures are very hard to follow and we go through the material very quickly. She does curve and drop quizzes. Also extra credit projects. Homework is not for a grade but you definitely need to do it. Be prepared to work.

                      She goes over the topics way to fast when all she does is repeat what the textbook says. Although she curves and gives grade replacements, there is always a catch. She makes her test hard. She is a hypocrite. She tells her students that she hates memorizing, but all her exams are based  on memorization of formulas and equations. Don't take her.

                      Kang is one of the most caring profs I've had, and she curves A LOT. She lectures super fast and her tests and quizzes may be a little more difficult than the other professors who teach the class, but by the end of the class, you WILL know diff eq. As long as you make the effort and show you care, she will make sure you get the grade you deserve.

I would reccommend taking her if you can because as long as you try, you'll do well.

                      King assigns non-traditional assignments, but requires that you submit multiple drafts (which he gives very detailed feedback on). If you do what he suggests, your grade will be fine.  Very approachable and ready to help. Don't expect to be able to sit in the back and not participate. Weekly writing assignments graded only for completion.

                      Dr. King was very nice, and very helpful when you asked for help, but this is not an easy A english class. You have to do the readings because there might be pop quizzes, and the way he grades, if you get an A on every project but one, you'll have a B in the class. He expects the students to have a love for video games as much as him, which is not.

                      Dr. King is approachable and eager to help if you ask for feedback. However, he does not realize that students take English because they have to, not because they enjoy it.

                      I have taken 2 classes with Prof. Leahy (CS2110 and CS2316) and they were both my favorite classes at Georgia Tech. Leahy is the best professor I've ever had because his classes are really well structured. Weekly quizzes make it much easier to keep up with the material and not have your grade ruined by one bad day. Also, his lectures are great.

                      Professor Leahy is a once in a lifetime experience at Georgia Tech! He is absolutely hilarious and a fantastic lecturer. There is a lot of homework and one exam which are a bit tricky but if you go to lecture and understand the material, they are very doable. Don't graduate Georgia Tech without taking a class from Professor Leahy.

                      Definitely one of the most hilarious professors at Georgia Tech along with Greco and Simpkins. Lecture was always entertaining since Leahy likes to add humor to them and the topics are actually really cool imo. Quizzes, timed labs, and the final are definitely fair if you understand the material. The only downside is that some of the homeworks were

                      What made the class was the TAs. Professor Leahy taught the lecture and the main concepts on how to code in C (specifically for the Gameboy). TAs went over what Leahy taught and ran the labs. There were no tests, relatively easy quizzes (every other week), weekly graded labs, and weekly homework. Attending class  easy pass.

                      Leahy is easily the best teacher I have ever taken, I learned more in his class than all my others combined! Take him if you have a choice, but be ready to put lots of time into his classes.

While the material tends to be straightforward, this is definitely a class that will keep you on your toes. Mistakes are easy to make and, unfortunately, are punished severely. Leahy doesn't like partial credit. Good luck.

                      Awesome professor! Super helpful and made the class enjoyable/entertaining. DON'T BUY THE BOOK. You never use it. I had never done any sort of programming before, and I made an A. Leahy made the material easy to understand and the homework assignments were pretty fun! Make sure you go to each lecture. Quizzes are pretty easy as well.

                      If you've never seen this stuff before, he makes the class a little difficult. He assumes you already know C and won't actually teach it. Go to Office Hours and talk to him. He is really entertaining and funny, but is terrible at organizing lectures and doesn't know how to teach. The head TA taught everything on Piazza.

                      I'm considering minoring in CS because I loved this class so much. Leahy is probably one of the most patient and good natured people I've ever met. He did a great job explaining things to nonmajors; I think I got frustrated with the other students more than he did. My CS friends say he's always like this too, though their classes are actually hard.

                      He makes his lectures interesting with jokes and tries to make the class bearable, but it is still a fairly difficult class. The lecture and lab sometimes feel like different classes. The lab is taught exclusively by the TAs. Unless you are real smart, I wouldn't try going solo in this class. Make friends or go to the TAs for help.

                      Tests are average but working book problems doesn't help. If you are unable to make it to office hours, he's not willing to find another time or meet with you 1-on-1. When you email him questions about the homework, he takes 3-4 days to respond just to tell you that it is too difficult to explain over email. Absolutely useless.

                      Tests consist of a large part of final grade (each of the two midterms was 30%, and 13 homework was only 5%), but the problems are straightforward and not that hard as the homework. Get a textbook is a must.

                      When you first start the class and don't really pay attention, you think Leland is a really boring lecturer. If you start listening (and take notes - just for yourself), you will realize how unbelievably intelligent he is. I think I got a 100 in this class honestly. The work load was easy and the class was very interesting. Only open to LMC majors.

                      You are guaranteed an A if you sit down and do your work properly. He explains what you need to do clearly in class, and shows enthusiasm while lecturing. Most of the students seem bored, but this can easily be cured if you take part in the conversation. The professor is also very laid back, but do not treat him like a pushover. You are warned.

                      Prof Lin isn't the easiest professor, but not the hardest. We had weekly quizzes, except for when there was a test, which were challenging but kept us up to date with material.

                      I thought Professor Lin's lectures were fast paced. 2 tests, weekly quizzes, homework, and the final made up your grade.

                      Professor Lin is a typical Georgia Tech math professor who is incredibly smart, which causes him to go through the material really fast.

                      Liotta is awesome- he makes it way easier to get an A than the other professors do. The tests are super straightforward because he emails out a list of the types of questions that will be tested. Also, the test questions are always very similar to the homework questions. This class obviously takes a lot of studying though.

                      Grading scheme in his class makes it easy to get an A (final can be exempt, 1 test drop, 85 is an A, etc.). His lectures are based on powerpoint slides which are derived from the book, so attending lecture isn't particularly helpful since most of the class is memorization. He's often rude when answering questions, but sometimes tells funny jokes.

Get ready for curve-balls on the exams (engineering, think outside the box questions). The hw is very helpful in helping you learn. Do well on hw and it bolsters grade at the end.

                      Dr. Losego is one of  the most organized profs I've had. The homework is tough, and you NEED to go to class everyday. You need it for the lecture notes and the clicker points.

                      Dr. Loss is an excellent professor and overall a cool guy to talk to. The content of Calc 3 is difficult, but if you put in effort, it's not hard to get an A. There are quizzes every week, two exams and a final. Quizzes and exams were fair, final was hard. Everything on quiz and exam you've seen before. Do practice textbook problems to study.

                      He's not the most engaging lecturer. He mostly works examples on the board while facing it, which makes him hard to understand. That being said, his tests and quizzes are fair and you get two dropped quizzes at the end of the semester.

                      Professor Loss is a really cool dude. He's very approachable and friendly, and his lectures are actually quite helpful.

                      He takes his time to explain each concept thoroughly to you. The class is very textbook based. If you read the chapter, then homework and exam practice is straightforward. To prepare for exams, don't only depend on practice exam. Instead, focus on the topics list he gives you. The exams are straight off of the topics list.

                      Loss used to be hard, but he was paired with Morley to increase the percentage of kids getting As. As a result, the class is very doable, with extra credit on every exam. And I want to make it clear that it is VERY POSSIBLE TO PLACE OUT OF THE FINAL EXAM! I think about 50% of the class is able to. Highly recommend loss.

                      I enjoyed this class. It isn't always easy, but he provides you with the tools you need to succeed. He had three old tests posted on his website for each section to practice (and 2 old final exams), but also gave out another practice or two before each test- pretty similar to actual test. If you like math, do the work, and study, you can do great.

                      Loss is a genius and he makes sure his students know that. Coming from high school his class was rough because he speeds through large amounts of material in one lecture. Getting a B is his class isn't hard but getting an A is. I got an A but I had to study around 15 hours each test to get an A. His class is definitely tough but it's doable.

                      Not an easy teacher to understand in lectures. He curves his first couple of tests but after that you are on your own. His tests are very hard but he does provide practice tests. Your TA will be a life saver.

                      Loss was very likeable and was very willing to help in office hours. However, his grading is pretty rough. He drops one test, and if you have a low grade (f/d/c), you will get a decent curve. If you have a B though, you're screwed. I had an 88 without a curve and didn't get an A, even though the average of the five test averages was like a 60-63

                      He was understandable and really knows the subject. He also posted old tests online that were helpful. Sometimes he goes the extra mile and somewhat complicatyes problems, but that stuff never ahows up on tests. Overall very straight forward and likable guy.

                      At first I had a really hard time following him in lecture, but eventually I got used to his teaching style and he became my favorite professor. He does stress theory a lot, but he relates it to application. Very good professor

                      I struggled with the way taught the subject. Coming from Calc BC in highschool, I expected to know how to do some of the problems already, but he emphasizes logic and does a lot of proofs, so I spent most of my time trying to learn the math from his perspective. If you can understand his practice tests and u go to his review sessions you will b ok.

                      Grading is subjective. They ""grade on how much a project wows"" them (direct quote from TA in class). Lectures have nothing to do with projects.

He really does care.

                      Maybe it was just this class, but it was so hard especially if you don't have coding experien. There are like 5/6 projects and you have 2 weeks to learn a coding language and then make an amazing project. Grading was rather subjective, which was kinda annoying tbh.

Marchenkov tends to emphasize mathematics over physics, but he's careful and clear about explaining concepts.  His homeworks demand a lot of time and effort, but he weights them accordingly.  He's very willing to help students.  Get him for Class Mech II if you can.

                      Dr. Markley is the most kind and caring professor I've had at Tech so far. Her course is hard (esp if you're not into US politics), but she wants to succeed and is willing to do anything to help you reach that end.

                      One of the hardest classes I took at GT, but I also learned the most. Dr. Marr is an incredibly smart person, and he can be intimidating to talk to because he is one of those people who knows everything about everything. I think going to his office hour really helps because he sees that you want to do well and work hard (and he is fun to talk to!).
                  </p>, <p class=""commentsParagraph"">
                      Dr. Marr's class was very challenging, but I have not taken another class that taught me as much. His lectures are very interactive in the sense that he talks through the concepts and makes sure his students are on the same page. He has very high expectations, but in my case, this just pushed me to accomplish more than I thought I was capable of.

                      A brilliant professor that's passionate about his subject, yes.  But he won't let you through his class if he thinks there's any possibility that you still believe in such ""falacies"" as free will.  The single most depressing class you'll ever take in college.  It's hard to study anything when it just bums you out...

                      Professor Marr is horrible to take.  But you have no other option.  You will fail his tests, but it seems like everyone does so he curves it to some degree.  Just be prepared to have no idea what is going on, read 4 different books, write 200 pages of commentaries and outlines on them, and give up any reasoning to believe in free will.

                      It's too bad Dr. Marr gets bad marks. Yes, his classes are challenging. But, he was one of the best profs I had. He actually puts thought into what he teaches and cares that his students learn. Easy class doesn't = good class. It's the stuff you had to work for that you will remember down the road.

She's really a fantastic teacher and since she graduated from Tech she can really connect with what students are going through.

                      Looking back on it, I really enjoyed the class. Marsicano truly loves teaching matlab, and it shows. To do well, you really have to do all the homework (and be capable of teaching yourself). The murkiness of the grading system is annoying.

                      The class on its own is hard, so there's no way around that. Marsicano is definitely better than Smith, as you actually learn during lecture.

                      Dr. Murray is energetic, eloquent, and hilarious! He does a great job of explaining concepts and often prepares fun demonstrations for lecture. The exams in this course are fairly difficult, but if you keep up with the assigned reading and homework and work through some of the past exams, you'll be prepared.
                  </p>, <p class=""commentsParagraph"">
                      Dr. Murray is great. You just have to adjust your expectations from a typical class because he does the flipped classroom thing. He does teach in lecture (and with a very positive attitude); it is just through the explanations of his clicker questions. Do the short homework assignment and textbook reading before class and you will succeed.
                  </p>, <p class=""commentsParagraph"">
                      You have to read the course material from the (surprisingly unhelpful) textbook because the lecture is spent answering clicker questions.  Murray is enthusiastic and kind and will some explanation in class, so lecture isn't a total loss. The clicker questions may show up as MC on the test. If you can do the homework, you can get a A on the tests.

                      This is one of the hardest classes I've taken so far and Murray makes it somewhat bearable.  He is very good at explaining abstract concepts and is a fair grader.  However, his tests are reallllly hard and the homework sucks.  Try to get him though because just about every other professor will leave you confused.
                  </p>, <p class=""commentsParagraph"">
                      You have to read the book or else you won't understand. He gives really good feedback when you ask him questions. If you don't understand something just  ask him. You can walk into his office whenever you want and he'll let you in as long as he isn't busy. I asked him a question after every lecture and he gave me very clear answers.
                  </p>, <p class=""commentsParagraph"">
                      Murray is okay, but he doesn't really teach concepts in lecture. He just assumes that you come to class understanding the reading assigned so you can answer the clicker questions. You definitely should go to lecture to get the clicker points, but it's pretty boring. Tests were hard, but if you can do the homework problems on your own you'll do well

                      Murray's class is flawed but so is every GaTech intro PHYS class. Nothing is taught in lecture (all you do is clicker questions), but you have to go because attendance is taken (and you need the clicker points). Therefore, you're going to have to read the textbook before every lecture to do well.

                      Seems very knowledgeable but his lectures are just him asking questions via clicker the entire time. His tests are very easy as long as you read the chapter before.
                  </p>, <p class=""commentsParagraph"">
                      Dr. Murray does not teach. The class is based on you reading the textbook and then coming into ""lecture"" to answer clicker questions. The clicker questions included material that wasn't explicitly covered. I went to office hours once, but I didn't find it helpful because he did not explain concepts thoroughly and acted as if it were obvious.

                      Go to class! The clicker questions are part of the grade (and about the difficulty of the test MC part), and it will matter if you are boarder-line. He covers all material through clicker questions, so it is not a traditional note-taking lecture. DO THE HOMEWORK. There is a bonus percentage, but it won't help if you do not do the review practice.
                  </p>, <p class=""commentsParagraph"">
                      Go to class for the clicker questions and make sure that you read the sections before the class. Professor Murray starts class with clicker questions and then explains the answer afterwords. Class is more a practice for the tests than a lecture. Very clear professor, and he is very good at explaining the material.

                      I find Professor Murray to be really efficient. However, you must read the book in order to do well. I recommend anyone taking Classical Physics to actually study a week before every test from the test bank. Make sure you know how to do every single problem.

                      Tries to make lecture material clever but instead wastes time with arbitrary examples made up on the spot and full of mistakes. Recitation and online guides are your saving grace. Take the tests SERIOUSLY.

                      He spends too much time on examples that don't even go into much depth regarding the course material, and he often makes mistakes.

                      Fred is a caring professor and he knows what he is doing, but you'll not know what he is talking about most of the time. You will be confused and he will not give you the answer, but he will give you some feed back that can be helpful sometimes.  The class in general is very time consuming and hard but hard work will most likely/ hopefully payoff.

                      I attended Kantwon's lecture though I wasn't in his section. He is the best prof if you have no previous coding experience. Explains topics really well, focuses on the why behind each topic rather than just solutions to examples. This semester they stopped allowing students from other sections into his lecture and scan Buzzcards (due to fire code).

Don't wait until the last minute to do homework, because you never know when there will be that one problem that takes you forever to do. Go to recitation. The TA's are probably the best TAs at Tech.

The course load consists of a midterm short paper, a midterm, a final long paper, and a few quizzes. Definitely go to class if you can; a lot of the quizzes and midterm will have questions that we talk about in class. Overall, a really great guy and an amazing class.

                      Super funny guy, tells amazing stories. But you NEED to go to class, because the stuff he covers you need for quizzes, projects, and essays.

I've taken several of his classes, and he consistently gives about 50 pages of reading HW per class for the first half of the semester and then only assigns movies for the second half.

He is a pretty harsh grader. Forget everything you've ever learned about writing and get ready to learn how to write his way. He makes you work for your grade, but if you try you'll make an A.

                      I took this class online. Due to the setup of it, I never saw or met Schatz. But the online format seemed easier than in-class. There were 5 labs, which were making videos (easy A) and 2 tests, which were pulled straight from GPS, IPS and old tests. Not tricky. 1/3 of grade comes from online meet ups with TA and 4 students. Hard to fail this class

                      Schatz is a solid choice as far as physics 2 professors go. His style of notes works well for me and he is usually easy to understand except for some really difficult concepts. However, he had a tendency to get impatient with my class at some points and snapped at us a few times.

                      I thought PHYS 2212 was very easy with Schatz. His lectures focus more on concepts than problem-solving, which may or may not be preferable for you. Funny, up-beat guy. My advice here is mostly course-specific: focus very hard on trying to get a 95-100 on one of the exams. The weighting system will get you very far. Don't miss lab ever.

                      Schatz is pretty engaging for slightly boring material. Class is much easier than they make it out to be and they have ways to try to help you pass like weighting tests and stuff. Classes are pretty standardized. Schatz was pretty good about reading the room for when people really didn't understand and his notes style worked for me.
                  </p>, <p class=""commentsParagraph"">
                      Schatz is fine. He is an engaging speaker, but my interest in his lecture style waned over time. He uses a pen and tablet on OneNote to write out very bare-bones notes during class. This means that it's difficult to go back and glean any real conceptual stuff. The class is hard, but it's doable. Lots of weekly work, which can be annoying.

                      Schatz had good lectures. Information was presented clearly. Tests are tricky, but topics are always clear. Must know how to think critically. I approached him for help several times throughout the semester and he was not very helpful (redirected to other people/no direct answers). Overall teaches well but doesn't care about students personally.

                      Good professor, always made sure we understood any material before moving on. His lectures are always energetic and clear, though they tend to focus on specific problems to apply concepts learned, rather than giving definitions then an example then moving on.

                      This was Dr. Silva's first semester at Tech, so there is room for improvement. However, his lectures always seemed quite dry/robotic and ended up feeling too much like a chore (lectures are standardized across 1310). Fell behind on material often, resulting in doing homework that had not yet been covered. Common exams/final, you get a crib sheet.

                      Simpkins is one of the best teachers I've had here - easy tests if you study the PowerPoints. The homework can be slightly challenging sometimes but mostly very doable especially with a few friends. Highly recommend taking him - he makes the class very fun and even if you miss a week of lecture you'll be fine.

                      Dr. Simpkins has very clear lectures with well laid out expectations.

                      Simpkins is absolutely great! Lectures make sure you see things on a practical level. Homeworks took very little time compared to the harder CS courses. He teaches CS, not mindless coding! Only freshmen who've never taken a technical major course before complain. Don't listen to people complaining about technical language in a technical course.
                  </p>, <p class=""commentsParagraph"">
                      Homeworks are long and time consuming (esp the GUIs hw assignment). There was no final exam for this class (final project instead). Tests are manageable but be sure to review lecture slides and past homeworks. Lectures are unorganized (didn't learn much from them) so a lot of self-studying.
                  </p>, <p class=""commentsParagraph"">
                      Clearly thinks he's gods child and the only way he demonstrates care for students is jokes during class. Lecutres are scattered and mediocre at best. Once a TA taught a class and students actually got up and asked him stay instead of simpkins. The undergrad junior was a better teacher by a large margin. Rude during office hours and emails. Pompous.
                  </p>, <p class=""commentsParagraph"">
                      Your grade is 80% exams; the the rest is homework. Wording of homeworks and rubrics (if you get one) is unclear. You do not get an autograder. Tests aren't written to be hard, but the professor does not allow you to get any clarifications on questions during the exam. I felt like he didn't care about his students.

                      He does not care about 2316 at all he only cares about 1331. He released the auto grader for the final project at 5pm and it was due at midnight. His criteria for grading homework makes no sense either. Also, the week before finals we had 2 hws due, an exam, and he released the final project that week when he was supposed to release It 3 weeks ago

                      He is a great lecturer and likes his topic. He takes feedback very well. His tests are very weird and not at all like other material from class. His questions are worded very weirdly and specific. The material isn't too hard though and the practice tests are sufficient

                      Simpkins has a nice sense of humor. He (and his TAs) are accessible during office hours. However, his class is NOT beginner friendly. His lectures are disorganized and full of jargon. If you have not taken CS 1301, APCS, or any Java course, Simpkins is NOT the one to take. Homework is unnecessarily complicated and not relevant or helpful for tests.

                      He's a decent teacher, but personally I felt he went too slow. All of his lectures could have been completed in 20 minutes, but he often dragged them on. He does seem to take student feedback seriously though. He gave really easy and infrequent homeworks, which I personally didn't appreciate because they didn't prepare me well for the tests.

                      He seemed great at first but as the semester went on I realized he's not that great of a professor. He's funny but intimidating, he makes the homework hard for no reason and will lie about what is on the test.

                      Homework isn't that hard as long as you don't wait until the last minute. Tests aren't bad, you just have to make sure you study everything he mentioned in class, even if he only briefly went over it. If you ahve no java experience before taking this class, good luck, he goes fast. He makes students dance in class if their phone goes off :-) :-)

However, he explains new concepts very well by building on ideas that we've been working on the whole semester. His tests are pretty easy, the homework is alright, and he'll drop small jokes throughout class just to keep it interesting.

Simpkins' lectures are actually very interesting and he makes all of his materials available to study with. Would highly highly highly recommend!

                      2316 is the easiest CS class I've taken. Homeworks aren't that difficult, and tests are beyond easy. He gives extra credit opportunities and 5 free points on exams. The final was all taken directly from previous exams. He had pop quizzes in class, but if you tried, he gave you at least an 80 on them. Really nice professor overall.

                      Simpkins knows his stuff, but he doesn't put much effort into being concise or easily understood. This class is structured in a pretty disorganized way.

                      David Smith is a nice guy but his lectures are not great. But in all honesty matlab is not a hard coding language, it is how the course is set up that makes it difficult. This Calc 1 problem is a metaphor to what this class is: Find value of a, b, c so that lim (x0) (aex - b cos x + ce(-x))/(x sin x)  2 (in 2 mins). (Too much work for 2 min!!)

                      Smith is absolutely terrible. Just make your schedule so that you can go to Kantwon's lectures. Take advantage of the resources like Helpdesk and PLUS sessions for this class.

                      He's a nice guy. His lectures can be really cool and fun if you have prior coding experiences and really know the material. However, if you do not have prior coding experience, I would not recommend taking him, as his lectures utilize a lot of ""next step"" rather than the basics. Do all the tedious homework, and utilize TAs and recitation.

                      There's a LOT of homework. However, it only counts for a relatively low percent of your grade and doesn't get difficult until around 2/3 into the class. Final project was a bit of a joke. He often gets VERY off track (once timed for 17 mins) and can be difficult to understand from too far away. The recitation TAs were better than him in my opinion.

                      Would not recommend. By not having prior CS knowledge, his lectures can be confusing and unhelpful. Im pretty sure this man is highly skilled in MATLAB but he doesn't know how to explain it effectively to a bunch of kids that know nothing about MATLAB. Couldnt attend Kantwon's lectures but TAs know how bad smith is and do their best to catch us up

                      The problem with this class is that Smith just gives crazy examples in class and really never covers the fundamentals or goes off on tangent stories that have nothing to do with the concepts. I heard some recitation TAs are good but mine just went over the basics which isn't very helpful when homework is due on Friday and recitation is on Thursday.

                      I wish I could give Dr. Smith a higher rating because he's absolutely hilarious and easily my favorite professor this past semester but his lectures are not conducive for learning.

                      He wrote the literal book on the subject, but neither he nor his book is very helpful. If you want help, go to Kantwon's lectures since he actually teaches. For actual help, you have to go to the TA or the success center. Also, almost all of your grade is from the tests, so study for the tests and skip the homework if you have limited time.

                      If you CAN go to kantwon's lectures, do it. I couldn't, so I stayed with smith and it was fine. Everything is the same in 1371 across sections, so there are tons of resources to get help and do well. If you're in smith's lecture you'll be fine and learn the material, but he's not as fun as Kantwon even though he knows everything there is on MATLAB

                      Dr. Snow cares about health and wants her students to succeed, which is great. However, the lectures were boring, with her simply reading from PowerPoints (making notetaking fairly pointless). The tests had multiple questions relating to arcane statistics from the PowerPoints.

                      The textbook is all you really need for this class. It'll prepare you for anything he throws at you on tests.

There are things he talks about that are never tested on and things he doesn't talk about that are tested on so be on your toes.  It can be a bit frustrating.

If he catches you looking at your phone, he will fume like a child and storm out of the class, or simply stand there in silence for two minutes

St. John is rather rude and arrogant as a person, so I usually went to the TA for help.  An A is achievable if you put in the work.

                      I really enjoyed Stasko's class! His lectures are clear and helpful, so much easier than learning it on your own. He doesn't post notes, so you do actually have to go to class. He's a reasonable guy, and very articulate. Your grade is based on 3 Tests, homework, participation, and final. Homeworks require approx. 5-6 hrs a week. Would recommend!

                      Stasko is a really efficient lecturer and clearly communicates material in a way that is both engaging and entertaining. His exams are fair, and if you do the homeworks (which count for about 20% of the grade anyway) and study, the exams won't be an issue at all. Stasko posts practice problems from the texbook, but they are optional.

                      Stasko is by far the best teacher for introducing Java. You will learn a lot about the subject in this class at a quick, yet understandable pace.

Totally worth coming 15 minutes early every day to grab a good seat.

He doesn't pull any tricks on tests, tests are very fair and matches the lecture contents very well.

                      This class is an obscene amount of work more a mere 2 credit hours. There are several types of assignments including pre-labs, post-labs, notebook checks, lecture quizzes, pre-lab quizzes, etc. etc. In other words, there are many opportunities to lose points, and the grading varies widely between TAs.

He will do everything he can to help you and make class fun, and he gets to know each of his students. My only regret is that I probably won't get to take him again.

                      Prof. Stivers is such a good guy. His lectures are interesting, relatable, and easy to understand. As long as you watch the films he assigns (which are usually pretty good), pay attention in class, and participate, you'll learn a lot and get a good grade. I'm really glad to have met him this semester.

                      Man what a good guy. Not only had interesting lessons and lectures, but got the rest of the class to become more comfortable with each other.

                      He's a great teacher with a great personality. Possibly the most friendly guy on campus. He likes drawings on his quizzes. Study like he tells you and you will receive what you should. Easy class if you are interested in film analysis. Even if you aren't interested at first, discussing films with him will change you. He dislikes Chris Tucker though

                      Stivers is the only teacher you should take at tech for English hands down. He was always fun and engaging and his classes were never boring.

                      Streator is very well organized and has his lectures perfectly planned. 85% of your grade depends on exams, which are really hard and he does not give much partial credit at all. I wish the exams reflected more of what is asked on the homeworks. Only saving grace is the adjusted grading scale (A - 85 -B - 73-C) I put in so much work, still got a C.

                      Dr. Streator makes the most boring material interesting and funny.

                      Lectures are well-done, and he does a really good job of explaining tough concepts. My only problem with him is that his exams are really hard and difficult to finish in the time given. Also, the homeworks are graded really harshly. Otherwise, I think he's an excellent professor, and I'd take his class again.

                      He is entertaining as a lecturer, so paying attention in his class is not difficult.  He focuses on real life applications which makes for some hard homeworks.

He makes his criteria very clear, but he gives you creative freedom and expects the final work to be original/ good textual analysis. Lectures are more class discussions about the books we read. Participation matters in and out of class.

                      Dr. Sturm was very passionate about the topic of the course (Poetry, film, music, and art in New York City from the 1960's - present). His class was a bit homework heavy with questionnaires due weekly. He genuinely cared for his students in the sense that he wanted us to improve our multimodal skills. Overall, he was a fair grader.

                      He made a class about poetry I expected to hate fun and engaging.

                      The truth about English at GT is that it ends up being a lot of Engineering/CS students who don't care about English. Professor Sturm's class is not for those students. He is very passionate about the material he teaches and expects students to give lots of effort. You are allowed a few absences. I found grading to be difficult. 2 major group proj.

Class consists of  4 quizes and 3 tests,  the syllabus says you need a 93 for an A, but the average for everything is around a 90 and you also get a cheat sheet for everything. He is Awesome.

                      Dr. Taylor is a great professor and a great person! However, she assigns the most work out of any english professor on campus. Expect something due every single time you go to class. Also expect that you will have to submit every step of every assignment (logical outlines, rough drafts, peer reviews). Her class is really just a pain. Don't take.

                      Dr. Taylor takes English very seriously, and that means that she will be grading your papers (some are as long as 1700 words) somewhat harshly. She is helpful if you ask for help on rough drafts. Every assignment except the actual final draft is graded basically on completion. Make sure the topic interests you.

                      The class was really well organized. I feel she always came to class prepared, we never fell behind and it was easy to find out any information on T-square.

                      Unnecessarily time-consuming and generally uninteresting.

                      Take Dr. Thomas! His tests are fair (he provides study guides, which basically guarantee an A or B if you study those). HW consists of textbook reading comprehension quizzes, which you have unlimited tries on before the due date, so that's nice.

Lectures can be boring if you don't find psych interesting. CAP papers are easy As as long as you have been doing the homework. Do the study guides and you should get As on tests

                      The primary problem was that all of the combinatorial analysis material was taken from Trotter's own volume of work, so you won't get a survey of combinatorial analysis. Homework was easy and occassionally obtuse, and the single test was nearly straight regurgitation of long, drawn-out proofs. Try taking the grad-level graph theory course instead.

                      I actually switched into her class because I saw on here that she was a better professor than my other option (begrudgingly so because this was at 8am) Turns out I'd have been better off sleeping in. NEVER take her. I'm usually very good at math, but she was not fair, didn't curve like she said she would, and was not helpful. I hated this class.

                      She is very unclear in lecture, and never full explains a topic. She gives words and their ""definitions"", then shows a very simple problem in class, then moves on. She gives out practice tests that are MUCH easier than and often times nothing like the actual test. Not uncommon to have a class test average of 65% or lower. DO NOT TAKE!!

                      Everything was easy except the final, but I heard most professors for Calc 3 give hard finals. Generally, if you go to lecture and recitation, do at least some of the homework, and do the practice tests, the tests are easy.

                      She's a nice professor and is always willing to help. However, she gives weekly quizzes to be completed within 10-15 minutes which sometimes can take more than the given time. Aside from that, her tests are fair but the final was slightly difficult

                      Had her Spring 2012. She was very clear, but her tests are hard. Not only are they hard to complete in the time given, but they are worth a lot. Do not let quizzes lull you into false security. HW is optional but you must practice to do problems fast enough for tests. She dropped an impossible final and my grade dropped 10%-15% from that alone.

                      Valle is the greatest. Statics with her was an absolute breeze, and I came out knowing the material just as well as my friends with more difficult professors. As long as you go to class it won't be difficult and she's the nicest person.

                      Guy rating before me must be an idiot. Statics overall is not that hard of a class, and Valle has a clear cut way of teaching it. If you go to class and do the practice tests, you will make a great grade in the class. If you average an A before the final, you can skip the final. She is very particular about wording when you ask questions though.

                      Love his British accent, it's awesome. He's an alright guy and lecturer, but he tends to be a bit tangential. He also did not have many office hours, and all the ones he had were during hours that I had class. Pretty average professor, would recommend Shepler more.

                      The lectures were good, though he tended to go off topic at times. If you can, try to get Shepler for this class; both Wilkinson and Shepler are good professors, but Shepler explained certain topics much better.

                      I liked Dr. Wilkinson.  He has a funny British accent that makes some of the chemistry language used interesting.  He initially explains topics well, but I think he is sometimes too smart for himself and gets caught up in his own ideas when he has to explain things in more detail.  He is still very nice and the lectures are usually helpful.

                      Dr. Wilkinson is great! He clearly knows chemistry very well and endeavors to answer students' questions. Answers can get confusing, so I recommend Piazza or e-mails for straightforward answers. Overall, he's a good professor that really does care. His lectures can be on the dry side, but he covers the necessary material.

                      He closes his eyes while lecturing and does not lecture very clearly. He seems like a nice professor; he just cannot communicate well with his students during lecture.

                      Very nice professor. He knows what he is talking about, but can't really explain the material on a level students can understand. Reading the textbook and doing lots of practice problems will help in the class. Overall he is an ok chem 1211 professor.

                      If you pay attention in class and study the past exams, this class should be a breeze.

However, the final is going to be super easy (it's all the midterm exams compiled into one) and it'll be curved. Also, WebAssign is horrible so good luck.

                      I did pretty well throughout the semester and had an A in the class all the way up until the final. He pulled things out of the blue on that final. Kids were crying. I ended up getting a B in the class, though. Never went to lecture, and I wish I had gone just a few times because he's not that difficult to understand.

                      Once you get past his thick accent, Zhou really was a great professor. He tried really hard to ensure that the students were following what he was doing, and he did many examples. His tests and homeworks are fair; no surprises. There are no quizzes in the class. I would highly recommend attending lecture, not just recitation.

                      Bad lecturer, honestly, but his homework and exams are fair. He's known to put things on exams that were covered specifically in lecture, but not the in book-doesn't like low class attendance. He's hard to understand because of his thick accent, but he really does mean well. Put the work into the class, respect Zhou, and you'll be fine in the end.

                      Great professor. I can understand him well but you need to sit near the front. Very little homework and the tests are relatively easy. My TA is awesome.

                      Although he has a strong accent and does not use a mic, he is still understandable.  Examples on the board are very detail but sometimes a bit abstract.  His tests are quite fair, considering the subject.  Never did I feel like they were too hard or not pertaining to the material.

                      Probably the worst professor at Tech. DO NOT TAKE HER CLASS. She will spring surprise assignments on you due dead week, if you ask her for help she'll tell you about her straight A college career, and she reads off of he other professor's slides. She has no idea what she's doing. 10/10 would not take her class again.

                      Min Zhou is MY BOY. This man is the best professor I have had at Tech so far. His lectures can be confusing because he likes to derive pretty much everything, but on the flip side that gives you a pretty deep understanding of the material. The homework is way harder than the tests and he is mad accessible outside of class. Overall, I love this man.
                  </p>, <p class=""commentsParagraph"">
                      He gives very fair tests that are not too difficult. Lectures are not mandatory but a sign in sheet was passed around every class. There was a lot of homework for this class that was fairly time consuming. Overall nice guy and a decent professor.
                  </p>, <p class=""commentsParagraph"">
                      Overall nice guy and good speaker. Records lecture. Tells basic formulas and shows problem setup instead of working it out completely - enough for tests with formula sheet, but some (40%) homework is much harder. Book has similar Q&amp;A's, not worked out solutions. Work hard early in case by chance he makes the final optional (he doesn't always)

                      Min Zhou is an overall good professor. I found 2 problems: 1) If you go to him to ask for help on a problem, he will tell you how to basically do it and then just walk away and assume you understand completely now. 2) Half of the classes didn't seem like we were ever learning anything new. Other than that, he's pretty good, easy A not much work.
                  </p>, <p class=""commentsParagraph"">
                      I think the best way I can sum up Dr. Zhou is with a sentence he said a few weeks before the end of classes:  ""I'm going to be curving pretty heavily...I don't care if everyone in the class gets an A, I want you all to learn the material and succeed.""  There's a lot of homework and lecture material, but take this guy.

                      Took Zhou for COE 2001 as well. He likes to give a lot of homework with tough problems, however the test are much easier. He is very helpful and open during his office hours and he usually has really good Das as well.  As long as you stay on top of the homework it's an easy class.

                      The tests were fair and accurately tested the material we had learned. Also we could opt out of the final (regardless of current grade) and take a bonus quiz.   Only downside is the homework. It's a lot. Definitely at least 4 hrs a week (often more) and some weeks it was simply impossible. Much harder than the exams, so it prepares you pretty well.

                      First-class professor at Tech.  One statement of caution though: Be prepared to work/study very hard.  He claims he doesn't curve, although the test1 avg was ~35 and test2 a 50 even... BUT, he is a very smart man with a great track record, so if you want to learn one of the more difficult classes in AE, I'd recommend Ben Zinn

                      The class started out to be hard but he realized that students weren't doing too well and changed the quizzes and tests to be more practical and in line to what we were learning.

                      I thought he was fine, and it was also his first semester teaching this course. The first test was harder than we prepared for but he ended up curving it and gave use harder practice problems for future tests/made them easier. Our last two tests had a lot of problems we had seen before. He does do learning catalytics to check attendance.

                      let's start by saying that this man began a Finite Math class (one of the easiest math classes at Tech) by saying ""I anticipate this class will be harder than linear algebra and differential equations"" and he didn't lie. he doesn't teach well, he's boring, and if you ask him questions, he doesn't know how to explain answers

                      Praise the curve! This class was tough, and you have to work for your grade. Homeworks cover future material as on what you have already learned, which can make them tough. He also makes up his own problems. His lectures are high paced. He is very helpful in officehours, he also wants to help you understand the material. The class was a struggle.
                  </p>, <p class=""commentsParagraph"">
                      When he said the course was fast-faced in his syllabus, he was not kidding. If you do not go to class for a week, it feels like he is speaking a completely different language. His notes are very good, probably some of the best for the classes I have taken at GT. Oh, definitely go to his office hours, they are extremely helpful.

                      No matter who you take this is a difficult class. Haiyu (yes everyone calls him by his first name) is a very caring teacher. GO TO HIS OFFICE HOURS.

                      All of his assessments were much harder than the material use to prepare. He moves very fast so it's hard to catch up if you don't understand a concept.
