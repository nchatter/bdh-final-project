You're better off skipping every lecture and just reading the book.,"This professor has a useless website. His lecture is far away from the homework, the textbook and the exam. U always feel desperate before exam because he would post a lot of unknown stuff that would be in the exam. His lecture is confusing,and he wastes a lot of time waiting for u and doing extra useless work. Stay away from his class.","This professor is a great tutor if you are into the learning style of graduate level, otherwise avoid him at all costs. Class notes (some from wikipedia) and handouts are not organized, and he always assumes students to have known everything before class. Expect to spend extra hours on self-studying if you choose to take his class.","He's the worst professor I've had here. Though I got out of the class with a good grade, but I hate him since I didn't learn anything...Run away from his class as far as you can.",He is the worst professor I've ever had. He never explains examples and jumps all over the place in terms of material. Our class actually had to have review sessions with the math department before the final because nobody learned anything. Grading is completely arbitrary and unfair. AVOID AT ALL COSTS.,He tries to teach the class using real world examples without actually teaching the steps and how to use differential equations first. His first exam is easy as its more of a quiz. But without actually learning the concepts its very difficult to apply the material.,Has little respect for students. Probably shouldn't be teaching anymore. Avoid him.

If you show up to class, stay engaged, and ask questions, there is no reason you should not get a good grade in the class. His midterm was very fair and the group project is not difficult if you've followed along in class. For an 8am, 3-hour long class this was enjoyable.",Utku doesn't like giving students grades and instead focuses on making sure you understand and are learning the material. What this means is you will get an A in the class if you show you are trying and interested! I loved learning SQL and would totally take this class again with him! Even in an 8am section!,"Utku is the best professor I've had so far. He relates the class to real topics, tailors his lectures to your individual interests (as a class), and discusses his own research and how it relates to the class. Overall a really interesting guy who cares about his students and their success.","Literally so easy and a really good instructor. He makes the class not stressful at all so you actually learn. He checked our tests over before we turned them in, and still I learned more in this class than most of my other classes. Utku is a real gem.","Phenomenal, Knowledgeable and Well Respected Professor","Utku is inspiring, smart and quite engaging. Learned a lot.

Doing the readings is highly recommend.","Her Asian Mythology class is interesting, but the last word used to describe it would be easy.  There is quite a bit of material to know, since the exams are mostly written. Studying well, going to lecture and discussion, and reading guarantees success, though. There is one research paper, but on the plus side, the final is not cumulative.","Professor is very kind and helpful to her students, and the text she mentioned in the class can be found in the textbook. There are 3 exams and 1 term paper. Discussion only counts 5%, and the TA is important for your understanding of the course. Interesting class. I recommend this course if you are interested in mythology.","Not a blow off class, attendance is very helpful.  There are three tests and a weekly discussion with a quiz.  And a 7-8 page term paper. There are two texts and a study guide required.  She wrote one of the text books, and that one is much more helpful than the other in my opinion.",Very sweet and knows her stuff. Just make sure to do the readings and make it to class.,"Pandharipande definitely shows a mastery of her studies and presents her ideas in a fairly interesting way.  I'm not a huge fan of any kind of liberal arts classes, but I thoroughly enjoyed Asian Myth with her.  She writes the textbook as well, so as long as you do your reading, her tests are not difficult.  All of the main material is there.","Lots of mythology. Somewhat interesting lectures if you are interested in myths. Discussions are useless, only attend to get the 2% or whatever. Tests are extremely easy if you study and read the textbook.","Attendance is mandatory. Very very strict policy on it. Tests and quizes are extremely easy if you put the work into and go over everything that she puts on the study guide.

But if you enjoy the topic of Hinduism, you'll love it.","Apparently Asian culture is 95% about India and about 5% about all the other places. Seriously, her lectures are hard to understand, boring, and totally mandatory. Ugh... She tests on the pictures she shows, so if possible make a friend in the class and alternate going to lecture and taking pictures. Unnecessarily hard coursework for a 100-level.",She is a really sweet lady who genuinely cares about her students..She is probably not the best lecturer but her tests and quizzes are easy. The course lacked organization but the material was interesting enough.,I have found it very hard to follow her lectures. Often times she skips around between abstract concepts.  I would not recommend this class to someone who doesn't already know about Hinduism or isn't extremely interested in putting in the time to learn it. Also very disorganized with due dates and often cancelled or pushed back assignments last min,Incredibly difficult to understand and expectations way too high for a 100-level class.,"The class is only Asian Myth. after about 5/6 of the semester. Until then it's strictly Indian Myth, so if you have little prior knowledge of that, get ready to read your butt off. While not a super hard class, the grading policy was very vague, which made the 3 tests and term paper unnecessarily stressful. Just memorize every bold word","I had a really hard time in this class...the tests are pretty difficult since the just involve many short answers, matching, a few multiple choice and a long essay. It's hard to understand her accent (not her fault, just a sidenote) and it's overall just a really hard class, I wouldn't recommend it to anybody unless you have prior knowledge.","She is a cute elderly lady. Sometimes I have a hard time understanding her BUT, if you read her textbook (the one she wrote for like 80 freckin dollars)...you'll get what she is talking about. That textbook = the lecture. THUS..you do not really need to go to the lecture if you read the book. easy A... you just need to memorize for tests","Yeah, her Asian Mythology class is almost completely focused on Indian Mythology. But the class is easy enough. She emphasized keeping up with the reading but if you read the text the weekend before the exam and study vocab. you'll do very well.  easy and interesting class, get ready to nerd out hard on mythologies after this class","Its awfully easy if you're of Indian and have prior knowledge in the subject. I do not understand why Americans take this class. Be prepared to memorize 10 different names which sound exactly the same but mean totally different things. She is a really sweet lady, but some of the TAs can be quite painful.","I had a hard time understanding her (because it was a 9am class and her accent). She gives 3 exams and a term paper. I think this class should be called ""Indian Mythology"" instead of ""Asian Mythology"" because its 90% focused on india. Without having any knowledge about Indian mythology, I had a really hard time in that class.","I've only took her class because other people said it was an easy class. Apparently, the class is emphasized A LOT in Indian myths, and for some reason, there are many Indians. I guess that's why there are so many people saying it's an easy class...","I don't know why everyone thinks this is so easy. It is all memorization, however, it's all Indian terms. Be prepared to memorize about 150 terms per test. That's the entire class."

Likes to ask a couple questions about readings from the book on the exam.,"I found him incredibly hard to follow. If people asked him to clarify he just repeated what was on the slide in a difference word order. His tests were extremely challenging and designed to trick you. Every question had a ""none of the above"" option.

Extra credit on exams is not given by points but will be applied on how you do on the exam. Uses good charts though.

Not the worst, not the best","Professor Parker's class intimidated me in the beginning because there is so much to learn in his little book, which is however well written and friendly. He is a very smart man and I never thought he was pompous for making his intelligence obvious--in fact it pushed me to work really hard on papers and my lowest grade on anything was a B+.","I took both 300 and 301 with him. I LOVE professor Parker. I had a great experience in both of his classes and my writing has improved exponentially since taking his course. He cares about literature and genuinly wants his students to do well. Great, great professor.","I took his class in undergrad and now am a PhD in another uni. I thought itd be a good idea to take a class whose teacher instructs from his own book. Meh. Now, I use it as ref material (its an easy read), but not enough to keep me on par with my peers.  There is an ego, but its not intentional. Serious academics, avoid this class.","Pretentious, condescending, rude, and generally quite ignorant for someone with a Ph.D. He makes up words (HELLO??? ENGLISH PROFESSOR!)and if your opinion does not coincide with his you are automatically wrong. Ruined great literature and what could have been a very interesting class. Get out now while there is still time. You will not regret it.","People say he's arrogant, but I've never gotten that impression from him.  I've taken two classes with him now, and I've loved both of them.  He is truly passionate about what he teaches, and he really cares about his students.  Go to his office hours, it really helps!  Take his class!","1) do not take this class, take another professor!! he wrote his own book, he knows it well, this means high standards and ur papers are graded hard and u'll get low grade... if u want to learn something and get a good grade, take another professor... seriously... u'll regret it if u take this class. this guy is rude too.. sounds arrogant..he sucks",Genuinely cares about his students and passionate about what he teaches. One of the best teachers I've had and one of the best and most groundbreaking classes I've taken in the English department. I'd definately recommend his section if you're an English major!,"Huge ego and condescending attitude hidden behind an obvious layer of fake humility.  Still, wicked good at English, a good teacher, and helpful during office hours.  He compares skipping class to ""a slap to the face"" and an insult to everyone in the room, so you probably shouldn't skip - your grade drops pretty fast.","He is brilliant, and you will learn a lot, but he is condescending bordering on rude, and he does not make students feel important. Still, an extremely knowledgeable professor and worthwhile, if you can get past the ego.","He might come off as a little bit superior at times, but I really can't stress how much this man genuinely cares about the material he teaches and, more importantly, his students. He's a great teacher and a good guy. And his textbook is excellent.","He might come off as a little bit superior at times, but I really can't stress how much this man genuinely cares about the material he teaches and, more importantly, his students.

Somewhat difficult material, but he is very helpful and the best TA for the class. If you're required to take this class, get Tom as your TA!","Super cute, but way harder than the fall teachers.

This class is an easy A as long as you retake the online quizzes since most of those questions appear in the midterms. Also, there's NO final exam.",Very easy to go up to talk to. Understands and addresses any concerns you have. He curves all the tests so thats a plus. There aren't any extra points in the class besides test points but because he curves all of them its no big deal. Really nice guy!,"Dr. Parrett was always so nice and helpful and wanted everyone to succeed in the class. He curves the grades at the end so an 85% and above is a B, and doesn't believe in minus grades. I really enjoyed this class!",Great guy and professor,I thought the class would be fun but a lot of it is about farm animals and there is only a week for companion animals. I give 0 f-ucks about anything other than companion animals so the class was boring. Got a B,I loved Dr. Parrett he made the class fun and he is a real easy person to talk to. He wants the class to get a B and above.,"The class is much different than most classes. You are taught by a myriad of professors and are really only taught by Parrett for a few sections. All the professors are great. You purchase a DVD for $75 at the beginning of class that substitutes for 2 out of your 3 lectures of the week, so you only go on Mondays and labs rock! Highly Recommended.",No Comments,This class is ridiculously easy and Dr Parrett seems decent in class but he is  very **** when it come to girls that want to be veterinarians.,"Dr. Parrett is hilarious. Good teacher, interesting. Basically gives you the answers to his tests. No homework or book. The class is fun and easy","He is very condescending when you ask a question one on one, especially if you are female. He always tries to talk the entire class out of becoming veterinarians because ""you could make more money doing something else."" He doesn't understand that the majority of us want to be vets to help animals, not get rich quick. It is rude and insulting.",He is a pretty good teacher and a nice guy. Pretty much all the information on the tests are given to you in handouts so studying is not difficult. If you are a James Scholar I would recommend taking this class for easy credit.,he's really nice and down to earth. he wants everyone to do well in the class. he also really wants everyone to share his love of beef i guess? whatever its cool.,He's a very nice guy.  Taught straight to the test.,"He was a really helpful teacher, and always willing to talk to you outside of class",very good guy. class is good. usually a diff teacher each topic so you don't see parrett much. he curves all the tests 5%. you can do well as long as you study and go to class b/c they usally tell you whats on the test. class is mostly about farm animals/farming. i learned a lot,"really nice guy, good teacher, fair grder.","Good teacher, very considerate to students - doesn't make you buy a book and only gives pluses, not minuses.

Lectures were very confusing but Parrish is a nice guy and will help out if he can.,"I love him! He is humorous, motivating, helpful and motivating! The based-on-homework test system is so reasonable. A diet coke every day is fun for sure, but I appreciate his nice tidy dress. He is smart but not nerd, almost the perfect, ideal model among the math people.","He's fun,clear and helpful, but kinda glosses over the material and you only realize how much you don't know once you start the homeworks. Exams are straight from the homeworks though. Overall a great professor","In the beginning of the semester, he was not so clear, but over time he started explaining things in depth. Stick the the Webassign and you will do fine. But make sure you understand the underlying structures and read through the textbook often. His tests come right from the textbook. Overall, a great class.","Pretty good professor. Tests are fair and generally ""no surprises"" as he says. He sometimes explains concepts is a bit hazily, but it kinda motivates you to study a bit more. Has a killer sense of humor, so you definitely won't be bored in his classes. I'd recommend Parrish to any student who has an above average interest in math.","I very smart guy who is extremely good at math. I take his honor course. If u want to achieve high score, do the webassign carefully. It is much more difficult than exam, if u get through the webassign, u would definitely crush the exam.The only problem might be he doesn't explain everything clearly so later in semester it's much to read textbook",I don't know why he has a really high rating at all! HW is really tedious and cost me 8 hours to finish it. His lecture is not helpful because he only mentioned  the ONE easiest example during lecture but HW is really hard. Basically you just study yourself.  The only good thing for him is that he did CURVE for final grade.,"I found his lectures helpful, but later in the semester I found that the book is a MUCH better guide to learning the fundamentals. Parrish mainly does examples in class. Very likable guy, knows his stuff, and helpful, but the examples aren't as good as just reading the book. As mentioned above, Exams are VERY close to HW.","It's DifEq, so it's not super easy.  Test problems are pretty much the same as the homework, though- Parrish says ""no surprises"" and means it.  Only two tests, a final, and the homework. Class was okay though.  He was easily thrown off track, but seemed to always bring the topic back to math eventually.  Recommended.","Parrish is a smart guy and knows a lot about math. He is willing to meet outside of class to help. Material is hard and sometimes rushes through notes. He's an odd guy, but he is likeable. Unfortuanately, he goes on useless tangents in AND out of class; it can get frustrating, but it does ease the mood. He is tough, but not trying to fail anyone."

There is no need to attend his lectures at all and if you want to get a good grade, you definitely need to do a whole bunch of self-studying. Also, the homework and exams are way beyond the teaching materials.","Rude, unprofessional, not good at teaching, overall his is the worst course I've taken at the University. It's not the content it's just the way he teaches it.","Lecture is tedious and trivial, but exam is hard and expects you to know stuff outside the class. Try the other prof of this course.",Misses huge chunks of stuff in lectures yet expect you to know it all for the exam. There were specific chapters that he barely mentioned at all in lectures,"Madhu definitely knows his stuff, but sometimes he's not very clear about more complex topics in lecture.  Just showing up for lecture won't give you enough information to do well in the class.","While clearly explaining things, he does not try to make sure a majority of the class understood material before moving to another topic.  He is nearly impossible to contact outside of class, and did not even have office hours for the first half of the semester.  At least he's somewhat enthusiastic about the material...","dousche bag. He is rude and unprofessional outside of class. In class he is fine and understandable. If you go to talk to him about a grade on your exam, he will not listen to your explanations. He straight up insulted my character and questioned my work ethic when i tried to explain one of my answers on an exam.","Pros: Teaches important concepts missed out in the textbook. Good quality homework problems; extra credit ones are usually challenging. Cons: Takes a week to get feedback on homework, but that's forgiving given the large class size. Used a tablet to lecture, which proved ineffective.",Prof Madhu is bright. He understands his stuff. Decidability is just not understandable for many students.

Grades are no problem because he curves.,Ray is awesome. Strict in class. Lots of homework. He has tons of real world experience and makes course super interesting with industry applications. His exams are hard but he is super kind prof and if you meet him in office hours he will help you a lot. Also he will curve grade and so you end up with good grade in the end. He values learning over,"Ray is a good professor that values knowledge over grades. He applies almost all of what he is learning to the real world, and is not afraid to be honest. I just wish that there was more review in preparation for any content being graded because his quizzes and exams are difficult. He's a ""check all that apply"" kind of guy.",Interesting course. Great prof. Prof makes class interesting. Provides materials for taking certification exams. This class helped me pass my info security certification exam and I am now employed in industry. Not an easy A though makes you work for it.,This prof made the course interesting otherwise it be a lot of theory. He has lots of industry experience looks like and he would tell may real world examples in class which made it interesting. Quizzes kinda tough but he curves and gives everyone a good grade in the end. I thought he was too tough with deadlines and penalty points. I would again.,Good prof. Makes you work for grade but ultimately gives good grades. Hard exams and quizzes but gives bonus points. Has passion for teaching and has good knowledge of the subject.,Hard quizzes lots of class work. I was worried I may get only a B. Grades were posted yesterday and I look at my grade and WHOA I got A minus. This prof lectures amazing. I got interest in IT field after this class. Be prepared for lots and lots of work but final grade will be good. He will be kind and give lots of good advice if you go talk to him,Quiz was TOUGH. Strict about deadlines. Super strict in class. You do learn a lot. He told us he worked in industry for many years. Gives tips on what is important for getting jobs. I listened to what he said and got an internship.

Some of the exam questions are out of nowhere. She spends so much time speaking of the concepts, but doesn't use numberal examples at all. The problem sets have minimal guidance. She tries to be helpful, but usually isn't. She's nice, but a terrible professor. Lowest grade so far in college.

There are six homeworks and two midterms, plus a comprehensive final.  Class is calculus based, must know partial derivaties (just basic calculus is sufficient).  She does not allow calculators, but her exam equations are very simple and do not require the use of one anyway.  Very helpful in office hours as well.",This class is highly recommanded.  It is not easy but very helpful.,"The test are just like her pratice exams(almost exact). But don't be fooled the tests are hard.  The great thing is that the tests are graded to give you tons of partial credit, so just know how to set things up.  This class is Calculus based, not all the Econ 302s are.

1982066,3.9,James,Pascaleff,10,0.5190770996489226,James would help you a lot if you really love mathematics.

He mostly focuses on showing you the inner relationships between theorems and the beauty of math. Also approachable &amp; very interesting.,He does tons of proofs (not on exams) and few practice problems. The homework can be very hard at times. The exams contain mostly easy problems and are very similar to the practice exams. The worksheets done during discussion do not help with preparing for the exams.,His lecture was not comprehensive,"Pascaleff was pretty great when I had him for 241. He clearly explained concepts, gave examples, and most of the time I was able to follow what he was talking about. Sometimes he had trouble fitting everything he wanted to in a single lecture, but overall he was a good professor.",Every lecture is structured the same and he gives great examples. His tests and homework are graded fairly.  He is very approachable and has a good way of explaining concepts. Would recommend if you prefer a very structured lecture.,He's fantastic if you're a conceptual or visual learner.,"He's not a great lecturer, but he is definitely a funny guy. Math 241 was definitely a hard class for me, and his lectures were of no use to me whatsoever. You're better off just skipping lecture and instead learning the days material from the book or from the homework that's assigned, of which there is a LOT.","hes a pretty cool guy, but unlike the other reviewers I dont think his lectures are valuable/the tests are easy. I know many kids who skip lectures because they dont help for the test. Overall, this was the hardest class I have taken at UIUC.",Pascaleff rocks. One of the coolest and funniest professors,"He gives clear lectures without introducing unnecessary material. He motivates the material well, and is usually able to answer student  questions. He is pretty lenient with grading, making the course easy if you attend lectures and study. I only used the textbook a couple of times, as his tests are based only on what is covered in lectures."

He also doesn't like to answer in class questions.","Very, very good professor. He's a younger guy who is obviously very passionate about his class so he keeps it fun while still teaching a lot. Also, I was someone coming in with absolutely no accounting background and with the way he taught it was easy to pick up. Exams are a bit difficult but he tells you exactly what you'll need for it.",Great Class and Great Teacher.,"If you take ACE 240 before this class, it is the easiest A you will ever get. Paulson is an awesome teacher and it is generally fun to go to class.","The class was alright but the worst part about this class is his exams are so long that you usually don't completely finish it in 50 mins. as he likes to cram a bunch of stuff in. Also, if the project is anything like we had this yr.(a whole business plan), then expect that to take up lots of your time, and I mean lots of your time.",Good professor. Tests are very similar to homework problems. Does a lot of examples in class that are similar to HW and test problems.,"Real nice guy, does a good job of making the material straight-forward and easy to work with.  No textbook, everything is in class so going is recommended.  You can get the lecture notes online, but he tends to do examples and fills in a lot of blanks in class."

Conversely, he does not upload any lecture notes, nor does he work from a note sheet that people can follow.","High expectations from students. Killer exams, but his lectures are original and unique. He knows the material and can talk at length and in detail without great preparation. Lectures supplement reading rather than repeat it. Strict, somewhat intimidating, and does not take BS. Demanding professor, but best classes I've taken have been with him.","Great teacher and knows his subject(s). Committed to helping students understand the material. For ex., he created homework questions (pretty difficult) and the exams were a direct reflection of the homework. Also organized help sections for the homeworks.. But, yeah, he can be intimidating. And he expects you to know what was taught in the lecture",Notorious for being the toughest professor in the university. Talk in his class and get kicked out regardless of whether it deals with the class.,Writes an essay on the board during each lecture. NO correlation to the book material. Expects a class full of students such as Mr. Meyers. Test bends you over. Class is Class Impossible.,"Different than most professors. Makes the course more about understand why things are the way they are, rather than just having you learn it to test it. Learned more in his class than any other. Go to office hours, if he sees you've made an honest effort on the hw and you ask intelligent questions, he will walk you through them.","Don't miss class and ask plenty of questions. Office hours are a must, extremely helpful if he believes you are trying. Very tough but certainly doable.","He makes exams very difficult, but definitely do-able. Be a good student, go to class, and most importantly, show him you care about the material and he is a very helpful. People say avoid him, but I learned more about problem solving and engineering than I would in any other class. He only expects out of you what you can accomplish. Don't be lazy","This professor is infamous among ME majors at UIUC for being the worst professor you'll ever take.  Bad at teaching (spent 2 lectures canceling units on one problem), bad at helping (yells at students and even other professors), bad at writing exams(average on the first exam was 28%).  Avoid at all cost!",Comments said he is too harsh while I should say the comments are way too harsh. Pearlstein is a very patient guy who would explain something you don't understand many times. Exams are hard but not impossible. I was worried when I saw the comments before taking this class but it turned out that the class is the best one I've taken so far.,"Great professor, lectures are clear, homework questions are useful and helpful for exams. Exams are not that hard as long as you go to the lectures and do the homework. He also held question sessions weekly which are really helpful. He welcomes questions through email and answers them quite decently. Uses blackboard a lot. Like his way of teaching.","Everyone will tell you to not take a class with this professor, however he ties everything he teaches into the real world industry. He has more office hours per week than all my professors combined and yes, he WILL make fun of you for mistakes, but suck it up, you are there to ask questions. Exams are difficult, but definitely possible.","He's a grumpy old man that clearly does not know how to teach. The lectures are extremely boring. He wastes tons of time doing arithmetic rather than helping people understand the big picture. Frankly, he is quite an unpleasant person. Make a point to not take this class with him, as he turns it into a much bigger ordeal than it should be.",He prepares for this class the least of any professor I have ever had. He wastes so much time in class going over extended examples (which he does on the fly) that are not relevant at all to the material. He also gets angry very easily and is an overall unpleasant individual. NO PEOPLE SKILLS.,Class is extremely difficult and professor is definitely that stereotypical genius professor.  That being said office hours can be very helpful and he does offer lots of office hours/question sessions.  Definitely expect to work very hard in this class.,"Where do I start? Worst class I have ever taken.  Going to class does not help, doing the homework does not help, going to office hours does not help... nothing helps. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS WITH HIM. He gave 4 people a 2 out of 100 on a midterm and said there wasn't going to be a curve because someone got 100.",DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS!,If you like to learn by having someone talk in front of you for 50 mins and write down every single word that comes out of his mouth then this may be the professor for you. We rarely did example problems. Exam are hard but he says there is a huge curve. He really makes the test so someone as smart as him will ace it,He talks straight into the board and the tests are extremely difficult.  As he puts it if you know the information (and by that he means to his level of knowledge) then you will pass.,"Avoid taking any class taught by this man. He's your typical genius, arrogant professor that expects everyone else to be inherently brilliant. He seriously talks straight into the chalkboard for 50 minutes, and writes down every single word he says. Honestly, he is my worst professor throughout college thus far."

Quick tip- if you talk to him personally, he has a hard time not giving you the answer","Peecher is a super nice guy who cares about every student.  His class is very laid back - he is incredibly reasonable (will adjust assignments if the dates/amount of work is not fair). Show up, participate and pay attention and it should be an easy A. One of the best in the college of business.","Nice guy but is way too harsh on tests and group projects, when they're both highly subjective.  Kinda rambles during class lectures and it's hard to figure out what's actually important.  Easy to do well if you pay attention, but you'll probably do way worse than you thought you did on tests just because of how they're worded and graded.","Materials taught in Accy 405 is not easy. However, Peecher is willing to help and try to make it as easy as possible for his students. There are often extra credit opportunities, and he is really quick in addressing his students' issues and answering questions. I recommend him over other 405 professors.","Peecher is a nice guy. He really loves what he does, but auditing is a pretty dry topic, and Peecher makes it dryer. He likes to put the class to work, he expects you to try really hard, but you probably won't remember or use anything from class in the real world. But I guess that's just the way college is. BTW Peecher is a die-hard Republican.","Prof Peecher is awesome, and hes on facebook which is so cool!!","Prof. Peecher uses a lot of jargon and acronyms which makes him difficult to understand. He also expects you to read a lot of articles, some of which are a bit outdated. You just have to do what you can to make it through the course. I don't even remember much of what we went over, but I think that's typical of UIUC accounting courses."

My cheer goes out to those don't solutions to MPs!","The class is easy if you have programming experience, but if you don't you're in for it.

The lectures  aren't very good, but he will take the time to help you if you go to him.","Not that clear during lectures. Chad is there to help you understand the material. Don't expect to understand the lectures without a little bit of knowledge from Jason's Notes. Did not learn much from the lectures. Even though the professor was not very clear, it was hard to hate the class since his personality kept me interested in the material.","Good guy, stuck around after class upwards of 5 hours to help people finish MPs. Needs more experience, and it's noticable that he considers his performance and what he can do. There was a general consensus criticism in Mid-term evaluations and he changed what he was doing right away. Stand up guy who I highly recommend.","Loved teaching but had no clue how to teach. Enjoys high tech stuff but wasted lots of time when they brok. Bad handwriting and rambling lectures. Promised all As but reneged on the final grade, giving lots of Bs and Cs.

Now I can't get enough of it!",It was very hard to understand him.  He didn't explain things well at all.  It showed on his tests cause they were really confusing questions and they were usually worthless fragments.  Smart man but horrible teacher!!!,"Perdekamp is the man... i love his accent.  Hes really knowledgeable and helpful.  you dont have to go to class if u look at the lectures online, do the hw, look at the previous exams before tests, and go to discussion.  Lots of extra credit. Easy A.","Even if you get Cs on the tests you can get an A in the class. There's tons of extra credit and the curve is comfortable. Go to the labs and do the homework - and if you have trouble with it ask him, because he gives all the answers! Beware the TAs though, as you may have to work to understand the material on your own if you end up with a bad one.","He knows his stuff, but, more importantly for the people looking up this stuff, PHYS 140 is really easy. Extra credit is abundant, a high portion of your grade is determined by doing weekly homeworks and attendance to ""labs"" once a week, and the tests aren't hard. Unlike other very easy gen eds, though, you'll probably actually learn some physics.","When the tests roll around, you may think your grade's in jeopardy, but by the end of the semester, you'll find that an A+ is achievable. Perdekamp  has a very thick accent and poor English, which kind of hurts the lectures, but on the other hand, he is very smart and knowledgeable, and very kind and helpful.","How Things Work! His accent can be hard to understand if the class is loud. He's very nice, though probably too smart to be teaching this class. Attendance in lectures is required with IClickers and you just do silly experiments in lab.  Weekly homeworks that help boost grade. Exams are based on old exams that are posted online.

His exams were impossible because of the term section, which no amount of studying could help. His lectures were horrible, very confusing and did not help you understand the texts at all. Very rude and took himself too seriously.","Second time around with Prof Perry, rated him for 209 earlier as a freshman. This class was smaller, a little more intensive as it is a 400 level. Captivating speaker, knows everything- not just Shakespeare but Renaissance Drama in general. If you need someone to write a letter of recc for grad school, having the head of the department isn't so bad","Professor Perry is so much fun! He is a great lecturer, and he really knows what he's talking about--he makes lectures interesting. While lecture attendance isn't mandatory, it does help a lot with understanding the material. Perry makes quirky jokes, but helps get the point across.","The Best Lecturer i've ever heard. Wants to get to know all of his students. Very clear, very funny, very casual in his lectures. Great powerpoints and incredibly honest and humble. Class has tough materials but you dont even need to read if you consistently attend lecture and pay attention. Great person with a passion for English Literature.","Professor Perry kept things quite interesting in lectures, and also gave a very good analysis of all the texts we read. He spoke clearly and was easy to understand, and also very helpful if you ask him for help. I learned a lot in this class and also had some fun."

He takes a bit of warming up to, but in the end Professor Peters provided really useful &amp; practical knowledge about business and Finance. His class is simple (but not easy) and straightforward. Class discussions were enjoyable. Overall good professor!","As I look back on college, Peters was definitely one of my favorite instructors. If you participate in class and study the material you'll be fine with the curve. Think a little outside of the box. The material is super interesting and pretty useful in the financial world. Don't take him if you want to sit in the corner and avoid learning.","Easy grading scale, Cool guy. Interesting in class. Not sure what these other kids are talking about. Probably not business majors and don't know basics.","Of the handful of Finance classes I've had to take towards my Actuarial Science major, this one is by far my favorite because of Professor Peters.  He is a fantastic professor who pushes his students towards critical thinking beyond the textbook.  The class wasn't ""easy"", but the knowledge I'll for sure use later on is well worth a B in the class.",Avoid him if you can.,Do not be deceived...this man is not a good teacher..he tries to act like he knows what he is talking about and is above everything but really is just rambling a bunch of nonsense about banks. I don't even bother with class anymore b/c full-credit is impossible to obtain with his exams and the grading approach he uses or however the hell he grades.,"Seriously? He seems to think that he is extraordinarily smart, and you should easily know what he is talking about. My recommendation: don't take him.",No Comments,"Considers himself smarter than the textbook, tests are essay/short answer(with partial credit- arguing for more points will do you NO good).

2371997,3.5,Paul,Peterson,2,0.44846579007899634,One of my favorite finance classes in U of I. He is a fair grader and exams are very straightforward as long as you know how to do the sample exam. He also asks you to do a trading simulation online and an interactive trading simulation in MIL lab. I learned a lot about derivatives trading in his class and I would recommend it to anyone interested.,Peterson is exceptionally poor at explaining all concepts in the entire course. I learned everything on my own time from just reading his lectures myself. The homework and exams are moderately difficult. He's almost never in his office during office hours. He is a nice guy if that matters.
2299023,4.1,Sarka,Petrickova,26,0.5743067296508297,"Good at explaining things, although she went very fast. (Difficult for beginners.) Caring, kind person. Often didn't explain important topics till the end of lecture, thereby rushing them, or didn't complete explanations of longer, difficult problems. Sometimes wasted time on less relevant topics, instead of prioritizing important ones.","Sarka was a pretty good lecturer. Sometimes, she wouldn't be able to explain something clearly, but she did put up the notes online. Exams were somewhat difficult (as usual), but if you study enough you'll be fine. There's a slight curve at the end of the course, too.","Sarka is a very kind person and makes a clear effort in making herself accessible outside of the classroom. Her tests and quizzes are fair in difficulty and much easier than some of the homework problems. I do find her explanation of new concepts to be confusing sometimes. Overall, a good professor.",Sarka is a great prof! 10/10 would recommend!,"Personally, I really liked Sarka. Her lectures were always easy to follow. Sure, there were a few things that were a bit confusing at first because of a slightly weird explanation, but I certainly wasn't expecting perfection. In general, she was a great professor",Sarka was alright. Bad at lecturing but her midterms were fair in difficulty.,"Sarka is an amazing, caring, and funny person. Her lectures are great, and I was able to understand everything in one lecture. Never gone to office hours, but I heard she's accessible outside of class. She's also a human being, and you could talk to her about anything! I'd love to take one of her classes again.","Sarka is an incredible lecturer, and the course would have been a very trivial one without the quality of her lectures. She made things very intuitive and understandable for her students, which is incredibly hard to do in college-level mathematics.","The class is not too difficult, I only took Calc AB in high school and decided to take Calc II merit section. I was expecting it to be more difficult than it is. If you show up, take good notes, do the homework, and study, you should easily be able to get an A. Sarka does a good job explaining material, though she occasionally brushes over topics","Sarka is great, definitely go to lecture she makes things a lot easier and she is such a nice person.","The course is pretty hard. Sometimes the professor did not explain things very clear, so I watched Youtube videos to help me understand. Make sure you go to every discussion session. I found the tutoring hours helpful.","Her lecture was above average, I thought she was great because she gave you the materials needed to do well on exams, I always knew what to expect.",I love sarka. Her lectures are all online in case u cant be in class. The homework and quizzes/worksheets are there to only help your grade and theyre really helpful. Her exams are very similar to old ones and practice exams and she never threw curve balls on the exam. She even curved the class a bit. A really nice professor and a true gem.,Sarka is an amazing lecturer! I loved her,I've only heard math things about Calc 2 but the way that Sarka taught it made it frankly easy to do well. She lectures very well all you have to do is pay attention and you will understand. She works really hard to be available to students and to be fair when grading. I would definitely recommend her to anyone that needs to take calc 2.,Really easy to follow along lectures. Tests were very fair. The structure of the course was very well designed. Her office hours are also very helpful.,"She's pretty good at explaining things, especially for being a new professor. Her notes are very thorough in class - she starts with explaining the theory and then gives examples, which helps A TON with understanding.","Very sweet woman. Class is very fast-paced. so some people miss the concepts. What I did was, I went to almost every classes (6 times absence maybe?), rarely studied the class material, but studied for 5 hours a night before the exam dates. Since I had 4 exams, 5 hours was more than enough to get ready for 1/4 of class materials.","Go to class every day, she uses iClicker and it helps your grade at the end. She has tutoring hours for people that don't understand. She likes to move on even when the subject is not clear for students. The class is fast-paced and exam heavy.

Highly, highly recommend you take him if you have the chance."
1549754,2.9,Nick,Petruzzi,9,0.4908075848381044,Amazing professor. All his lectures are interactive and without presentations. He makes learning fun.,"This is probably the most contradicting MBA course I took.  The class is easy, but somehow Nick manages to make things 10x harder than what they really are.  He's always jumping from idea to idea, and goes ""EXTREMELY"" slow.  The homework's do require some effort and time, but overall are not bad.  The final exam does not reflect what was learned.","Nick's enthusiasm comes it present at every class and it is a great asset when going over the material. He seems to always be available whether he is in his office or wandering the halls, so there is never an excuse that you didn't understand the material. Most won't use the fundamentals from the class, but they do help ""round"" your prospective.","Useless teacher. Good dancing, though.","Nick is one of the best business professors I have worked with. He has a very effective teaching style and he senses when the students need more clarifications. Having worked in project management myself, a lot of the things you learn in class are applicable to real world situation.","Will go weith the gen opinion here. Not useful, prof does not know Project mgmt (hasn't managed a business ever! so no experience of proj mgm!) and all we did was solve problems in class. ridiculous.","Its not that bad. Nick is fun. Learning, hmm well you come to uiuc for the degree, at low investment. so you get what u pay for.",Oh my ! the emperor has no clothes finally. problem solving is not equal to management Nick...,Most overrated elective. Nick says hi to everyone. So you take the course. Then you see what a waste of time it was. Learning-Zero. Usefulness-Zero. Entire class copies assignments. Minimum grade B. Advice for future MBAs- stick to Accountancy/Fin electives.
215723,3.9,Joseph,Petry,159,0.5306646163373592,Straightforward professor and a great explainer of things. He's very caring and approachable.,great class!,"He gave big curves to every exam, and the project is pretty easy.","Petry is a great professor and I have learned a lot from him. While his lectures may begin to bore you near the end of the semester, he is great at explaining and knows what he is talking about. The term paper is easy just follow the guidelines and the homework is easy as long as you read the book. Attendance matters because there are iclicker q's.","Petry is real nice and is obviously passionate about Economics. However, I really struggle with his teaching style and feel like I'm learning everything on my own. If you're someone who needs to be taught the material and struggles with doing readings, this is not the class for you. This class also has a ton of homework in addition to the readings.","ECON 203 has interesting materials, I really enjoyed the class in general. Besides, he gives a lot of extra credits, making the median to be like 82%. I never had those kinds of classes in my life where the median is 82%. His homework and pre-lectures just help you prepare for all the exams. All the exams are pretty much similar to practice exams.",I don't know how anyone can give this guy anything below 4.5. One of the best professors I've had on campus. Clear. Engaging. Friendly. Funny. BUY THE COURSE PACKET!,"The class material wasn't difficult, but I didn't really like his teaching style. He uses a pre-lecture homework based on the textbook to ""teach"" you the material and then spends half the class time or more barraging you with iclicker questions that he hardly goes over. However, he does give you extra credit on the pre lectures so that's good.",good,By far my favorite Economics professor at the University. He's so funny and actually cares about the success of his students. He WANTS you to do well. Lectures went by so quickly because I was always learning something instead of spacing out. Exams were tough but grades were saved with a generous curve. 25% curve on Exam 2 my semester!,"Easy A. Show up for the iClicker-heavy lectures and make time for the tedious weekly homework assignments and you'll breeze through the course. The exams are simply variations of the practice exams in the course packet, so make sure to do those. Petry isn't a great lecturer by any means but his enthusiasm is contagious. He certainly knows his stuff",Petry is awesome and loves interacting with his class. He is ALWAYS trying to improve the course and constantly seeks feedback from the students about what him and his TAs could be doing better. Class act,You have around 7 homework assignments a week that will each take approximately 30 minutes. Homework is worth 20% of your grade and takes up more time than it's worth. Lectures are useless because he doesn't lecture he only asks iClicker questions that will not help you. The only way to do good on exams is the practice exams. Final is impossible.,"By far the worst class I've ever taken at the University of Illinois. We were required to purchase an iclicker, a ""course packet"" that was just printed out lecture slides, and access to online homework which was a huge amount of mind numbing busywork. The only reason anyone showed up to lectures was for iclicker credit. AVOID AT ALL COSTS.",Thumbs up!!! Lots of Extra Credit!!!,Thumbs up!!!,You definitely had to work for your grade. I studied extensively for the exams and utilized outside resources yet I would receive low exam scores. The exams are EXTREMELY hard but he makes up for it with a curve. Definitely the hardest business core class. First class I ever got a B in.,"This is not a class where putting forth the bare minimum will cut it. Petry is straight-forward and has a lot of resources available (plus a generous curve on most exams), but he has high expectations of everyone in the class and demands that everyone LEARN the material, not just memorize. Makes you work for your grade, but an overall solid choice.","Very enthusiastic professor who is pretty good at explaining things, and the material really shouldn't be difficult if you are at all comfortable at statistics. Always curves if median isn't in the low 80s, so that's pretty nice.","Petry is one of the best professor's I've ever had. He is amazing, but ECON203 is one of the toughest classes you will ever take. He is super laid back, he would often have his dog run around the room during lecture. There are 2 midterms and a final, which are so tough, but he will give VERY GENEROUS curves. There is 1 group project, HW every week."

The work was supposed be very intense, but Dr. Pettijohn was very helpful and accepted late work for points off. He was very understanding of our personal lives, and made the class enjoyable. He loved to get feedback on the assignments as well. Great class!","Professor Pettijohn is overall a great instructor, advisor and person. If you can take one of his classes, do it!! He's passionate about everything he teaches and he genuinely wants the best for all of his students. This class is a lot of work/very accelerated because it's an 8 week class but he made me really enjoy it!!!","Professor Pettijon is really energetic about teaching and cares about his students. Most of the work in the class is reading from the textbook and watching lectures based on the chapters, with some reading quizzes too. A good chunk of work, but a fun course about the oceans if you're interested.","Prof. Pettijohn is such a great professor. Sometimes online classes can get boring, but he is VERY engaging and passionate about what he teaches. He structures the class very well too. As long as you focus on the lectures and don't let assignments slip by, this is an easy class. Plus, you'll actually learn meaningful things!",The class is a well rounded course where the professor is patient and does not skip steps or large portions of dense material. This is a great class to take for a general education credit. It keeps your brain working.,Dr. Pettijohn is the sweetest thing. He really want you to do well and is flexible on extensions and is very accessible. Great class!,"He is a pretty good instructor, but because I am currently taking this course in an eight week format, the information does seem a bit rushed, but it is supposed to be an accelerated course.",Very interesting class with relaxed workload and pacing. Dr. Pettijohn was very attentive and responsive to questions and really tried his best to make the experience as good as possible for everyone.,Great teacher! Very engaged with students and very passionate about what he is teaching.,"Overall, Dr. Pettijohn made a fun and engaging learning environment for The Oceans. Everything was easy to find and complete with a clear due dates. The workload was not bad and we connected with other students despite the online nature of the course. I would take another course with him as the professor.","I'm an online degree student and I took Prof Pettijohn my first semester and he set the bar so high for all my future professors. He is passionate about what he teaches and his lectures are engaging. He incorporates informative and inspiring articles and videos into the learning materials. He grades fair, if you do the work you should pass.",Was able to make online classes accessible and engaging! His enthusiasm about the material is apparent and makes lectures enjoyable. Very easy to reach over email and has a cute cat to boot!!,Mrs. Pettijohn is a great professor to work with. He is really nice and reachable at anytime. :),Professor Pettijohn is very caring for his students and helps with any problem you have with the course. He gives good feedback and are well prepared before class. He gives related material with the course and includes many activities. The 8 weeks section is pretty short and intense for me but I would recommend to those who like ocean.,"Really had lots of materials to memorize, but Prof. Pettijohn really did a great job in organizing them.",Best Professor ever. Love his online course. He really cares about students and responds really quick. Extra credits every week.,"Makes a full effort to accommodate all students in any situation, even recorded himself voicing over the required videos because some of the students thought the voices were unpleasant. Cares a whole lot about everyone learning and passing but packs a lot of information in so you will still have to work for your grade. Ideal teacher overall.",Would absolutely take again,"Great class but since I took the 8 week course there is a lot of information and work to do for it. Overall, would recommend. They give out extra credit every week so that was really helpful.",He is a great professor. Recommend to take this course.

This is the real world - get ready for it!","On the first exam I knew all the material, got all the right answers and received a D-.  I didn't format my work correctly. This means writing the word ""solution"" or lose points.  Drawing and labeling axis or lose points. Include the phrase ""draw the free body diagram"" or lose points. I got a B on the next exam. I didn't get a single answer right.","The midterm tests are extremely hard.  He is picky. I got A+ in physics and got c+ in this class.  If you can choose not to take this class, do not take it.  It is the worst grade for me at UIUC.","I don't get what people have with this professor. Yes, is you sleep through class you will fail.

You'll learn a lot from Philips if you listen in class.",Avoid him. Doesn't put lectures or HW solns online.(??!?) Has no idea how to efficiently lecture; he simply goes over too complicated examples very quickly. Very boring and dry. No calculators on exams; ALL questions are solved symbolically. Shouldn't be allowed to teach; everything about his class is way too strict and ridiculous.,"NOT A NICE PERSON.  His, exams are long and tedious.  He believes that it's his way or the highway. He is unwilling to change his views on anything.  His homework policy is CRAZY.  If you follow his RIDICULOUS policies, maybe you can scratch out a decent grade,  that is if you can follow his fast lectures and intense examples.","He gives very hard tests. Doesn't care if you pass, and has ridiculous homework expectations.","I got all the correct answers with all the correct work on the first exam but received a C because I did not format correctly, but on the second exam I got a C+ even though I got no right answers and had no idea what I was doing, but I did learn to format the way he wants... There seems to be something wrong here huh?","He is very intelligent and knowledgeable about the material. I learned a lot in this class because he is very clear. He is a bit too anal about formatting and solving rather than the concepts. He doesn't give out very much partial credit, and hardly gives points back on exams.","Terrible professor! I got every exam question right, yet i got a C and a D on the midterms and failed the final exam. He puts almost no emphasis on actually getting the right answer, but on doing everything HIS way. Way too anal about formatting your answer/work.",He is a nerd.

Tortorelli = nerd who needs a course in communication and to wear a bag on his head and ranaweera should never be allowed to teach again (wait...he's not) due to lake of understanding of english language.","A lot of people didn't like Philips but I didnt mind him so much.  He seemed kind of anal about some details but he always explained the requirements so it's your own fault to not follow the directions.  He gets annoyed by and tried to humiliate people who talk during class, which was kind of funny if it's not you.  Could've been a lot worse!","My best advice is to just avoid the TAM department altogether.  Between Philips, Tortorelli, and Ranaweera, words can not describe how horrible the teachers are in this department.

COMPLETE WIENER","Philips = perfectionist,if you don't explain stuff on the exams how he wants them plan to lose a lot of points regardless of being correct. Actual class material isn't hard but he makes up for it by having long tests. His examples are extremely clear and he is really helpful.

Design project at the end is a lot of work, but it's not bad.","It sucks that this lecture is at 8 am, however he gives answers to all the homeworks if you show up. Irregular grading scale (lower percents = higher grades) which is very nice","Ok so Philpott is a pretty cool person. I've learned CREO before taking this course so it isn't hard. Basically all what you are going to learn in this course is in the lab and from the textbook. Here's some advice: Go to every lab and sign in, do exactly what the textbook tells you to do, submit every inclassassignment in time and you'll get an A.","Brilliant man. Awesome person. Granted, lectures are a little dry for 8 a.m., but it's not his fault. Take a class with him if you get the chance.","Lectures are optional in my opinion. The material covered in lectures is about manufacturing and is never tested on. The true material is learned during labs (how to use CAD software), which is for a grade.","Easy. Don't have to go to class. If you do go, you get the answers to the homework. Go to lab and get your work done and is an easy A. Just have to hear him clear his throat a lot, but there are worse things.","Pretty good class overall.  You learn a lot more than you think.  You don't learn much from lectures, but sometimes he'll do the homework during them, so that's nice.  Real chill guy-brings a lot of prior knowledge to the class, which can be interesting at times.  You learn much more in the Labs than from Lecture.","Obsessively clears his throat. Pushes his software almost every class. Didn't really learn much in lecture, but there are in-class quizzes. Labs always took me more than two hours. It's really an easy class, though. You should get an A. It's just extremely annoying.","The guy loves his accomplishments. He loves to tell you about his software he made...which sadly i can tell you the name of it and who uses it and why because...hes told us so many times. ITS SO BORING. but, the class is quite easy and the labs make sense the way they are layed out so...good job.Easy grading scale though","Easy A. Show up for quizzes, if you sleep in have a friend do it. Professor is nice and helpful, his accent is awesome, the chairs and too comfortable and you will doze off.","Extremely boring teacher, but you still have to show up to 8 am class because there are in-class quizzes. I would either bring homework to do during class, or I would just go to sleep. I learned the most from doing the labs, and from my TA.",Philpott is a cool and nice guy but his class is extremely boringgg!!! I hate going to lecture but overall the class was easy because the labs make up a huge % of points. Labs are easy if you follow instructions. Quizzes r hard and unpredicatable so you have to show to every lecture. I don't think there was ever a single lecture that i stayed awake,"Good guy and I realize he can't help it, but his lectures are SO BORING. Labs are straightforward. Easiest class I've taken so far. In class quizzes are a pain in the butt, but they aren't difficult. Show up for the quiz and take a 50 minute nap.","Class is 8am and there are graded quizzes given in class.  Hard to stay awake because the lectures are boring, but he tries to make things exciting.  Hes a very cool guy and is extremely nice.  He is my academic adviser as well and hes awesome.  Knows everything about pro/e.  Good lecturer, and his british accent helps u stay awake",The class is really boring and it sucks that it's at 8am.  If you have ever used any CAD or 3D modeling programs before then the lectures are basically pointless but he gives out quite a few in class quizzes so it's a good idea to go.  Philpott explains things well but it's easy to figure everything out in the lab section.,"Brilliant guy, knows his stuff, admits that he wishes the lecture wasn't at 8am.   Ask him about his research, it's amazing!  Seems to have trouble remembering faces so if you say hi to him out of  class you might get a blank stare."

Every lecture was a rant about how the US sucked and Marxism was the way to go.  No facts.  Just his terribly-accented opinion.  Tests were impossible to decipher as well.  Avoid him at all costs.,"Literally the worst professor I have ever taken. I could not understand two consecutive words that came out of his mouth, and was uninterested the entire quarter. Horrible organization and terrible lecturing.","One of the very best professors I've had.  He is challenging, though, and abstract at times-- if you are looking for an easy, blow-off course (as many in my class were), you might try looking elsewhere.

The best part of class was when he ended a set of slides and then for a moment thought about going onto the next set...and when he let us go, everyone would exhale and cheer about finally getting out early.",Very bad teacher. Also his dandruff was distracting,"Not as horrible as it sounds. All 3 projects in the last 4 weeks of the class sucked. The final exam really sucked. Other than that, it really wasn't hard at all. Lectures are like death sometimes, so I only went on a grouptalk day.","He is absolutely the worst ACCY teacher on this campus.  Completely haphazard grading, no feedback on low grades, ridiculously poor timing of assignments and exams.  Spends no time on the most difficult parts of the course, tons of time on stupid sh*t.  Wastes time (goes the full 2 hours every day) and lots of awkward silences in class.","What a sorry excuse for a teacher.  The class is a total waste of time, you learn absolutely nothing.  He just rambles on for two hours but never actually covers any material.  If you have an ounce of common sense you can do just fine without ever going to class.

Would definitely recommend!,Loved her as a professor. This semester most of the grades were from online posts. There were no quizzes just a final paper at the end. She is extremely passionate about this which makes it interesting and very helpful. Attendence is extra credit - I went to maybe half the classes. Also you don't need the text book just read others posts,"She's pretty nice overall. Take the class if you can. 40 online writing assignments for the semester, they make up 40% of total grade.

I did not learn much in the class, but at least it wasn't too hard.","Not sure if I signed up for a Rhet course or a Documenting Inequality course  because we seemed to talk about civil issues more frequently than rhetoric/writing &amp; research. Expectations were unclear and syllabus was inconsistent. Grading is extremely subjective. She lacks conciseness, clarity, and comes off as overly-abrasive and self-proclaiming.","She does not teach CS-210, but I have had her tutoring appointments for my essays. We had good conversations on the essay's structure. She also helped me with grammar mistakes.","She makes a simple paper into an unnecessary amount of work. Not only do you have to write this huge paper, you have to do the weekly emails, weekly reports, connections, and argument mapping. On top of that she still wants to have lecture on long, boring readings that have nothing to do with what anyone is writing. Unnecessary amount of work!!!","If you attend class and genuinely contribute to conversations, Samantha's discussion section will easily become your favorite. She clearly cares about the quality of discussion and works hard to make sure class is worth your time. When she's not teaching, Samantha often meets with students. She's a fabulous reference and a knowledgeable teacher.",AWFUL! She doesn't explain what you need to do.

I really have no idea what you'd have to do to get a bad grade out of her but I think her mind is going a bit.  she pauses in the middle of words and loses her train of thought.","I think watching paint dry was far more exciting than her class: her lectures are impressively boring. I took ""Gender History until 1877"" which is truly only about white women in New England, Mayflower-1877.

Her class is not interesting and neither is her lessons.  She very rarely understands what she is teaching or the questions being asked in her class.

I can never really judge how I did on tests and essays because her grades seem to be sporadic and random.  She is very technologically challenged also.  Pretty nice lady though overall.,"This class was pretty easy with a light workload for a 400 level history class. The material was interesting, but she was kind of a hard grader with papers"

He stimulates your mind by teaching you not just the basic material, but in depth so that you are certain to understand the material one way or another. Your lucky if  you are assign this professor!",I had him as a Linear Algebra professor during the summer and he was honestly quite good. He would even take time out of his schedule to have dinner with us as well as play some games of Basketball during the weekends.

Very understanding if you miss class due to an illness or someone else. 12/10",Absolutely amazing guy. Cares deeply about his students and wants everyone to succeed. 2 short and 1 long-ish paper with an opportunity to revise one for a higher grade. Workload is fine. Highly suggest talking with him in office hours to solidify ideas for essays and chat about class. Highly recommend -- one of the best in English at Illinois.,i love tony. this is the 3rd class i've taken with him. by far the best professor in the english department,Tony is an amazing teacher. He learns every students name and really gets to know them. he is a very fair grader and gives chances to rewrite. He gives awesome lectures and is so funny. He makes the classroom feel very comfortable and he picks great books to read.,Tony is very by far my favorite professor I've ever had. His class is mostly discussion-based but he is so open and non-judgmental about student in-class responses that discussions can be really light-hearted and interesting. He is SUCH a nice guy and I wish he could teach all of my classes.,"i love tony. hands down one of the best professors at uiuc. i took engl200 with him and am going to take engl245 with him in the spring. if you get the chance, take his class.","Just an overall great dude. I am a lazy student and i still did well. furthermore, i wanted to do well in his class. He cared a lot so it made me care more.","Tony was very accommodating. If you want to meet with him, he'll work on your schedule.

He gave great feedback on all of my papers and was really knowledgable on the books he taught. I would highly recommend taking him for ENGL 200.,Pollock is definitely a great teacher. He tries his best to engage all his students and genuinely cares about each and every one of us. He is a great person and gives good feedback on papers.,"Tony is Incredibly smart, yet very down to earth. He's super helpful in office hours, whether it be to talk about a reading, or to get feedback on a rough draft. He grades on a system where you submit a draft, then revise and resubmit with the grade counting twice as much the second time. Above all, stand up guy who made going to a lit class fun.",I feel like this is more of a discussion class than a lecture for sure. I couldn't imagine having any other professor for this class. He's hilarious. Every time he curses catches me off guard. I would recommend Pollock to anyone.,"I've already written Tony a review and here I am again. I graduated but still remain fascinated by this man. In 16 years of attending school, he is the best teacher I ever had. I don't care if you don't even need one of his classes to graduate - take it anyway. Spoil yourself by being one of his students. The best of the very best.",Great class! Tony really knows what he's talking about and keeps the discussion flowing and interesting! He made every short story we read in class engaging!,"Be in Tony's class is the one of the few most enjoyable things you can do as an adult. He is such a pro to deliver the messages and techniques in the literature, at the meantime engaging your thoughts with optimal respect.","Tony is an amazing teacher.

Easily one of the best classes I've taken at U of I so far.","Tony is absolutely a riot. All of his classes were really engaging, hilarious, and he really brought the material down to everyone's level - which is nice considering it's 18th century fiction.

He engages all of his students, and whether in class or email or office hours, you always get the sense that he wants to be doing this and wants to help. Equally hilarious and insightful. This is how an English class should feel.","Tony is easily the best English professor I've ever had and I'm going into my senior year of college. Class was 1.5 hours long but it flew by.

DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS AT ALL COSTS. DO not be fooled by the fact the class meets two days a week. You will not care at all about this class. You have quizzes every week, which include doing powerpoint discussions and readings before the class.

It requires a lot more time out of class than I expected and attending lecture is mandatory for ""engagement"" points. The exams are tricky and are hard to study for.","This class is all based on strategy of how to take it. The online quizzes are easy, the participation points aren't because attendance isn't mandatory, and the tests are not bad if you study the materials he gives you. It's all about knowing key words from each chapter. Poole is always glowing with positivity and I actually learned.","O M G, HORRIBLE CLASS ! He's really interested in what he's teaching, but what they don't tell you is that this is really an online class with weekly meetings for attendance points! His 3 exams have the most OBSCURE questions and he literally have 5 answers to chose from, with one word variances between them! His TA (Yonnick) has an annoying voice.","I am not sure how he does on his major field, but he is doing really bad on teaching. If there is not attendance requirement, I will skip all his classes for sure, because they are too boring. I read so hard, but still do bad on exam, because he give chicky questions on exams. I prefer to learn more that relate to Communication.","The worst prof.Meets two times a week and the rest hour was for online stuff.But you will need way more than one hour for those.Classes are bored, cant learn anything, students go because of attendance and the discussion points. I had other CMN profs that really teach and we can learn, but not this one.

Slides posted online. 1 HW problem due every lecture, but it really helps you keep up with the material. Asks questions before and during lecture to make sure the concepts are getting through. He comes off douchy at times but sometimes it's funny. The hardest part of this class is putting in the time.","Hard, time consuming class but overall a great professor to learn from.

Hard exams, though.",No Comments,"Very knowledgeable professor, knows exactly what he's talking about. Tests are pretty hard, homeworks are anal just like any other TAM related class.

Needless to say, the class never had any discipline problems.  But she also could lighten the mood with humor.  She has an impression of Steven Hawking that is spot on.  Also, she is very helpful, conscientious teacher.","She's nice, and will definitely help you if you ask. However, she's pretty harsh on grading speeches - you will need to start practicing for them days before the actual presentation.","Went into cmn101 hating public speaking.

Easy to get an A if you try.",Terrible teacher. Do not take CMN 101 with her!!!!,"Beth is an enthusiastic, caring professor who wants her students to succeed. She always gives constructive criticism as well as positive feedback. I was a horrible, nervous public speaker when I came into class, but the exercises helped me overcome that. As long as you follow the rubric you will do fine. She grades more on content than delivery.","Hardest grader ever, don't expect a good  grade no matter how much work you put into an assignment. She will tell you to do something then mark you down for it on your speech. WORST TEACHER I'VE HAD IN COLLEGE. Drop if you get put in her public speaking class.","She's very very very strict with the grades!! she said she would do nothing with the curve even when you are on the edge. She's really passionate to help but sometimes the guides become confusing. At the office hour she told me to move partC into partA of my outline, but in the end she reduced my grade and told me to cut the whole part A off.",Not a good teacher. She will grade really hard.

He can be funny sometimes, but his cynical nature is a huge turnoff. His Wednesday lecture was the biggest waste of my time. He stopped giving quizzes after two weeks because he got too lazy. Pointless.","Professor Porton isn't entirely unpleasant, but his attitude is a huge turnoff.  He comes off as pompous and not very amiable.  I never spoke to him face to face, but this is what I got from his lectures.","aarogant, pompous ****...never take a class with this pessimistic jerk..i was lucky to only have a few lectures with him",This guy is ridiculous. He was a complete **** and completely uninterested in anyones opinions but his own. HE ALONE MADE ME WANT TO DROP OUT OF THIS CLASS - but I did stick it out. He really needs to get off his high horse and realize that he is simply a teacher and that he doesn't rule the world (THANK GOD FOR THAT).,"Porton has a very poor outlook on teaching.  He is very hard to approach and when you do he often talks about alot of things that you won't understand.  He doesn't take well to questions.  Overall, it was a hard class for me I only read the textbooks when absoloutly necessary.  I went for his help on one paper.  I got a B in the class stay away","This class is a lot of reading and writing because it is an Adv Comp. And true, Prof Porton is very cynical--he told us the first day that half of us wouldn't come back (he was right)--but his lectures are very interesting and he really knows his stuff!","He thinks he is always right and even seemed kind of arrogant. His class is deathly boring, definitely would not recommend it!","Portrays Judaism (his religion) as correct and thinks he's always right and will even begin debating students.

Some of the weekly readings are too long and hard to follow, but he covers them in class so their easy to understand. He also doesn't explain the 3 papers (2 reaction and 1 final) in detail so you just have to email him or go to office hours and you'll be fine","You gotta be really careful choosing this class. The prof typically doesn't give sufficient instructions on the papers assigned and the grading seems fairly arbitrary and unreasonable followed by no further interpretation. Very strict on attendance, weekly readings are more than enough to be finished. Get ready to work your tail off to get a B."

Oftentimes he doesn't explain what should be explained, and (although he can't control it), his voice is very soft and hard to understand. Most students prefer Chandra. Exams aren't too bad.","He's clearly smart, but he's just not a good teacher. He talks softly and he'll often talk for 10 minutes on one slide. Often he would cover 5 slides in 45 minutes. He doesn't provide review that's helpful for the  tests, making them unfairly hard.  I got a curved B+,  but I do not have a real understanding of the course. I wish I had taken Fleck.","He was an incredibly boring lecturer and he had no control over his students. Most students taught themselves. His examlets were very difficult both because of content and time constraints. Hard hw. Doesn't curve much, and Fleck's section is apparently way easier. He also doesn't iron his shirts. I'd skip this dude if you can.","While I have no doubt that Manoj is an intelligent person, it's hard to see while taking his class. Homework occasionally covered topics that weren't every breached in class, and the book for the class never touched the topics either.  Along with this, grading for the examlets was never really clear.  You would often lose points, but not know why.",There are some crazy hard homework  problems and recap quizzes that are literally impossible to solve or take a long time that are meant to bring your grade down.. tests are tough. He knows his stuff but I don't learn from his lectures.,Material is highly theoretical and often simply does not get the point across. Exams have averages of 50% frequently. Some lectures are interesting but most are hard to follow. Genuinely understands the material but has difficulty expressing it for a 100-level course.,Super hard compared to flecks section.  Annoying amount of work and completely useless lectures but have mandatory iclicker question so you have to go anyway.  Avoid at all costs!,"The whole class was very disorganized, the way he lectures is by reading power-point slides, you never know what's going on with the grading (the way he's set up the homework is ridiculous). Should've taken Fleck's class instead.","He's a great guy who knows his stuff. Lectures were usually boring, but that's probably because I knew half the material beforehand. A handful of people complained about the poor organisation of the course, but I don't think it was too bad. I do recommend the you get the Rosen book that Fleck (she wrote the book the courses uses) recommends.","Obviously a very smart guy, he's just not that great of a teacher."

One paper and two tests. Also had to attend a performance at Krannert which was out of my comfort zone. All in all pretty easy class to get some gen-ed credit for. Loved my TA he was super cool.",If you have any music experience this class is a breeze. iClicker in lecture and participation in discussion are part of your grade. She does a good job with the material and loves teaching. She does request student responses to her questions in lecture. Usually the same few kids always answer. Exams are easy to study for with her study guide.,"Praeger is a nice lady, though she is sometimes a little hard to understand. Class is not that important to attend, though discussion is (participation is a large portion of your grade). An easy A.",No idea what her focus of music is. Lecture are useless so are the TAs. Half of the Class skipped the lecture and the other half usually just sleep in the Hall. The TAs need to keeps waking people up and tell them stop texting.

I think we got some respect from him and he enjoyed a beer with us after the last class.","He thinks really highly of himself and he thinks his class is the most important thing in your life. Although the material is easy, the tests are unnecessarily hard because he phrases questions like SAT questions. You are also forced to go to his boring lecture to get the iclicker points.",Easy class but extremely boring,Most stuck up arrogant professor I have had at uiuc.. starts every class by a slide telling people to turn off cell phones Pauses randomly during lecture if there is any noise at all  and  just stands there wasting everyones time. yells at people before exams if they have hat on (seriously raises voice)..exams dnt start for 20 min into exam period,Difficulty of this class is overblown. I am not a business major but this is one of the easiest classes ever. The material is pretty common sense stuff. Exams will only appear tricky if you don't study at all.That said Preis is grumpy at times.And the only reason why someone might attend the boring lectures is because of the silly clicker points,"I-Clicker points make attending lecture almost mandatory.Since material is relatively interesting though you won't fall sleep during class.Useless activities as well but the silver lining is that you get 25% outside of the tests.These are hard because there is a lot of stuff and some of the questions,it seems, are deliberately phrased to trick you","I only took this class because he was the only one teaching it. His exams are very hard, and not from his lectures. Lot of readings to do (articles,textbooks,lecture notes). Lots of useless Pre-class activities that I don't understand why they have only one attempt. Not sure if it was always like this, but the TAs are lot irritating too.",EXAMS ARE NOT REFLECTING WHAT HE TAUGHT...,"Very boring, very stuck up.  No one likes going to his class.","Just a grumpy old guy. Just as 'difficult' as BA 310. If you read, you'll be more than fine.",One of the bad professors that you can't even avoid at U of I. Very nagging. He told us there would be no iclicker questions for the next class but he lied. Exams are pretty hard.,Tries to keep students paying attention with clicker questions.  Develops his own classroom distractions when he calls out people texting or on their laptops.  Very intelligent and friendly if you interact with him personally.  Exams are challenging but some questions are worded awkwardly.,"Also, forgot to mention that he is the type of teacher who likes to gloat about his accomplishments. I.E.: ""When I was in business"" ""I worked in consulting."" And anyone who's been in his class knows about his desire of boating. He even used it as an example of ""services mix"" in the lecture when he mentioned some East Marine boating school.",Terrible professor.  Managed to make interesting material extremely boring.  Called out kids for talking just to embarass them.  Unfortunately you have to go to class for clicker points.  Exams were pretty difficult.  Too bad he's the only professor for this class.,"One of the real awful professors you will ever run across at U of I. He is a smart guy but that unfortunately takes a backseat to his pissy attitude. He is a control freak basically. If 2 people are talking or texting or you try to open your test early, he will call them out.And for how much material there is, he makes the tests fairly challenging.","Smart dude, if you started your own company and went to Harvard you would mention it too. I missed a bunch of classes and still got over full credit, the trick is to look at the slide he JUST COVERED and answer them correctly. Don't ask questions like ""How hard is the test from 1-10?"" He'll rightfully make you feel like an idiot.",Go to class for the clickers but he makes the material harder than it should be.  he is also very arrogant,"I have never dealt with a more disrespectful professor. Disregards his students' legitimate questions and makes everyone in the class feel like they are unimportant. Which is odd since the students are in fact paying his salary. At least the class is easy, even with the pointless clickers.","class is a piece of cake. I dominated this class despite being a dumbass. just read the lecture notes and scan the definitions in the book and you'll do good. also, he's one of those guys who will stop the entire class and embarass you if you're using a laptop not for class or sees you texting. weirdo.","Clickers are a waste because they make you go to class. Lecture's so boring as he spends forever talking about the most simple things. The HWs are pointless, but easy. His exams are strange because he oftens puts more than one correct answer so you have to guess which is the ""best answer"", which is pretty subjective. About 2 Qs per exam on book."

A solid choice for the Writing/Language elective, really just busy work (most of which can be done in class).","Honestly, the best professor, by far, that I have had at UIUC. She really cares about the issues in her class and her students. She teaches in a fun, innovative, and effective way. I am taking one of her classes next semester as an elective I because of I loved the first one so much.","Favorite class of all time. Movies viewed in class included Frozen, I Am Sam, and Memento. The discussions are interesting too because Professor Prendergast is super knowledgeable and every student has a different level of exposure to and understanding of disability.","Professor Prendergast was my favorite professor at U of I.

The exam material is very easy, and it's a nice class to have at the end of the day and just relax. Although occasionally boring, lecture was helpful for pinpointing the specific exam material. TA sections are  somewhat annoying and unnecessary but sadly mandatory.","You don't need to go to lecture, in fact if you do it will probably just aggravate you (very very dull lectures). This is one of those courses that's so ridiculously boring it's actually difficult. I could've gotten an A, but ended up with a B because I couldn't even bring myself to study for exams. That said, a B without studying is pretty nice.","Overall an easy class, if you read the book there's no need to go to lecture.  And do not take Renee Gordon's Discussion Section!!!! I had her and her quizzes were really specific and did not reflect the difficulty of the exams.","Somewhat easy class. Lecture is optional, no random pop-quizzes like some other Mus 133 classes. Just memorize the stuff in the book and focus on the culture aspects of each country. DO NOT take discussion with Renee Gordon!! Each TA makes their own quizzes and she likes to make them impossible - try Rick Deja instead.",World Music is an okay class. It deals more about culture than music in my opinion. I pretty much skipped lecture and went to discussion only and got by. Too much of the class is brute force memorization.,"The worst, stupid and socially awkward professor ever! Extremely annoying, very bad at teaching...goes on rambling about pointless things that are not on the test!","In general her classes are very easy, exams are moderate... She talks to the students as if they were in second grade, a real snooze. She posts the powerpoints online. Don't bother going to class, you'll learn more from reading the book.

I learned a lot about how to do research.  The group projects where we designed and ran a study were awesome.","Good personality! A bit difficult of a course but if you study (as you should... you are in college for a reason), then you'll be fine.  Anyone hating on her prob got a bad grade and that's their own fault.

She really cares about her students, if you take the time to talk with her.","Can't teach to save her life, but excels at being extremely condescending and rude to cover up for her lack of knowledge and confidence. She does not know what she is doing which will show in her remarkable inability to teach and grade fairly.

She gives wonderful feedback and makes sure you leave her class with better skills than you came in with. She's also hysterical and makes class a lot of fun.","Julie is the only professor at UofI who I really connect with. She is hilarious, dark, a spunky hardass, and more compassionate than any prof I've met. She creates a community vibe in class where people get serious about their writing while still having a lot of fun. She makes you work, but why else should you be at University? Highly recommended.","She's worth taking a class with. You will write many poems, but it's up to you to revise as she doesn't (or didn't in this class) require a portfolio or grade revisions.

I can see how he might have been a bit dull, but some of the most thought-provoking conversations I've had in the department were with him.","I became so bored with one of his lectures that I decided to drop while in class.  He is a tough grader, an uninteresting lecturer, and I learned nothing from his course.  Also, used a horrible textbook (Adas Turbulent Europe or something) that was very expensive, despite low quality.",Worst guy ever. So boring. Dont sign up for his classes.,"I am a history major and this class is still unbearable. I really wish I could have dropped, but I was unable to. This prof seems to read off of his notes, is uninteresting, and spends way too much time talking about the assigned films. Worst prof I've had and worst class I've taken.","HIST 259. Worst professor and class on campus. Required to watch numerous foreign films outside of class, so much reading for 200 level class. Grading and exam study guides are ridiculous. Prof. is arrogant and expects you to know everything he reads off his papers in class. Very unorganized. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!",So much writing and reading. It's like having 400 class instead of 200 class. Countless documents and journals to read.,"He basically reads off ""lecture notes"" that are more like written essays. Slides are very unorganizaed and verbose. He does not get to the point despite all the information he gives. He expects you to read from multiple text books and watch films outside of class. His attitude is some what arrogant. Very harsh grader. I dropped the class.","I just dropped this class and I'm SO HAPPY. Unorganized lecture slides and boring lecture. We begged him for an exam study guide and he gave us 180 terms and 22 essay prompts, so he expects you to know everything he said plus the textbooks. The exam is tomorrow and I'm so glad I don't have to take it. Grading is 1/3 paper, 1/3 midterm and 1/3 final","Class basically involved watching him read from his own notes for an hour and twenty minutes. Very difficult class to sit through, and it is sad because the content was interesting. Beware, this class meets an extra day of the week, monday nights we had to watch movies and were a huge part of your grade as you will see when the first test comes","If you value your GPA, do not take a class with Prochaska.  He gave me the worst grade in my college career.  He is not clear on his requirements and grades harshly.  He held a grudge against me the entire semester and berated me in frontof the class.  My fellow classmates even sympathized on my behalf.  No one in this class or others likes him.","Although he is a bit vague, he is an interesting professor.  He is helpful when you go in to talk with him.",I didn't know I was signing up for a film class.  His grading is extremely vague but at the same time nothing to really worry about.  I think he is kind of cocky and his wardrobe kind of speaks volume about his personality.,"He took an interesting class and made it terribly boring.  He gives a lot of busy work homework, particularly for a History class.  Pretty boring guy.","What a disappointing class and professor. The class was a gigantic waste of time. It only met twice a week, and he only lectured once a week. The other times we watched movies. I didn't sign up for a film studies class. Got a B+, but wish I would have saved my time. Boring lecturer and speaker.",No Comments,"Not what you would expect.  A total independent study of foreign films, no modern political movement study as of 3 weeks til finals.  Lectures are harsh and necessary for the exams.  Nice guy at office hours but it doesn't help you with the arbitrary grading system.","I don't recall signing up for a film class, but that's what I got. Absolutely ridiculous class. Midterm 'study guide' preposterous. He must have tenure. Arrogant, smug, not much actual teaching going on."
2045607,4.4,Erik,Procko,12,0.5736179389292765,"Hard but DEFINITELY doable. Thoroughly enjoyed the first half of biochemistry with Procko. Hard material but if you go to lecture, review his discussions, and start studying WAY ahead of time (amino acids, structures, etc.), you will be prepared. Helpful during office hours. Really nice that they provide a lot of practice exams for 354 too.","354 in general is a pretty hard class, but Procko really makes you work for a good grade. Definitely go over the previous exams multiple times, and go to every lecture. He occasionally hand-draws notes on concepts and projects them in class, which end up being heavily tested on. Don't fall behind on the material, and you should be good.","Procko is a great lecturer and has a cool accent. His exams are pretty hard but fair, if you study hard and put the work in you should be ok.","His lecturing ability is amazing! He's very organized and speaks clearly (with an awesome accent). Study from the discussion worksheets and past exams, and make sure you word things correctly on exams. His explanations also made understanding MCAT concepts much easier.","Procko is a very solid lecturer. He got most of the concepts across pretty well. The exams, for mcb standards, weren't too hard. As long as you know some basic o-chem and the amino acids, all of the work will be plugging stuff into equations.","He's the better  professor of the two (combo procko/gerlt). His material is more computational and involves formulas, but if you know how to do every problem on his worksheet you'll do fine. MC was much easier than Gerlt's. Questions were not unfair, biochem is just difficult. Definitely go to his office hours because he's really helpful.","He gives great, informative lectures. He knows that most students are pursuing medicine, so incorporates real life application to much of the biochemistry in the form of diseases/causes. It is the hardest class I've ever taken, but easily the most rewarding. Procko is a great teacher, can't say the same about Gerlt unfortunately","Yeah, biochem is hard.  Procko's pretty low-energy but he's decent with his explanations, and his Aussie accent makes lecture more tolerable.  Note that he likes his mathematical derivations (some of which aren't in the slides - go to lecture!).  Overall a pretty standard MCB lecturer",He goes so fast in explaining the slides and just read them,Very good professor. Clear and helpful. No fluff. Hope he teaches again for future semesters.,"For someone teaching MCB 354 for the first time, Erik did an excellent job with his lectures. His slides are very well organized, and he throws in interesting tidbits. He's approachable, and office hours are helpful. I hope he keeps teaching this course.","Dr. Procko taught this class for the first time this semester and he did a really great job! The first test kind of shocked everyone (we all did poorly) but if you work at it, the class is not impossible. You learn A LOT!  Go to lectures, take notes, and study! The class is 96% tests and quizzes so you really can't earn points somewhere else."

Not accommodating and was not accepting of student's opinions. She read directly from the slides that she found on the internet, and did not give any explanations.",Class of 1997.  Great mentor and professor.  Dr. Proctor was a great resource in SPSHS and served as a mentor for my Ronald McNair and SROP projects.  Can't say enough wonderful things about her.  Reading is essential. Critical thinking is a must.  And expectations are high!  This is expected and should be for anyone entering the field!,"very unaccomodating to students requests or needs.  class attendance is a must, since her tests are based on no facts you could learn the text book, but on her opinions and experiences alone.",She's pretty cool and obviously extremely intelligent with the credentials to show it. Attendance is crucial to do well in this class since most of the material is covered in the almost 3hr class. Overall I liked her and you dont perform well you probably didn't go to class.,i can't believe u of i allows her to teach. honestly worst professor i've ever had,Her tests are subjective and she can't even back her own answers up let alone explain them.  She refuses to meet with students and going to class is pointless.  I have learned nothing in this class that i didnt learn from a previous class!,She is convinced that U of I is composed of criminal idiots and refuses to listen to a word that anyone else has to say unless it exactly agrees with her.  Bring a crossword to do in class so she doesn't drive you mad.,Very good professor. Must go to lecture for very easy points. Tests are easy.

She grades very promptly so that you can adapt your skills for the next assignment.  I did a presentation and got the grade in the same day with feedback.  Like another reviewer, I appreciated the fact that group work was eliminated. Too impractical for online.","Awesome class. She's a straight shooter with a sense of humor. Especially appreciated that she knows how difficultawful group projects can be, so they are eliminated from her syllabus. There are a lot of assignments, but they're actually kind of fun. Engaging class. Highly recommend!","Really wonderful teacher with an awesome sense of humor and a great approach to reference and customer service.  Assignments and lessons are extremely practical, even if you already have experience working in a library.  Highly recommended!","Incredible teacher. She was very organized, enthusiastic, knowledgable and helpful. Great communicator and fair grader. I like that her class was really practical; it wasn't into abstract theories. She also had a great sense of humor and was really open minded. Provided great feedback on assignments.","Awesome teacher, awesome human being. Jeanne really knows how to teach and keep her students involved.  Assignments can be tough, but she's always there to help, so don't leave it for the last minute!",Jeanne is a great teacher.  She is thoroughly knowledgable about reference and has much experience in the field as well.  She teaches (and gives assignments) in a very practical manner;  a student can actually apply what he/she learns in future jobs.  Hghly recommend.,"Puacz is enthusiastic and very intelligent.  She knows her topic and makes class interesting.  The assignments were reasonable (you had an assignment most weeks, but only had to answer 4/7 questions.) Fair grader.","She is a fantastic teacher.

In  addition, I  didn't  learn  anything  interesting  and  useful  in  this  class.","I have taken her online class IB 105 which is second-half semester course. This course is definitely not an easy A course. It requires so much work. If you are switching from tough elective course to IB105 by this professor, you would have more work load then before.","Surangi is a fantastic professor! She genuinely cares about all of her students, and is very intentional about offering help and ensuring that everyone understands the material. Take good notes, the material is not hard. Should be an easy A, she gives a lot of extra credit. If you are present in lecture and discussion, tests are not hard.","Go to lecture, take notes, pay attention to things she repeats (she repeats a lot - but for a reason). The tests can be tricky because you get a lot of allnonecombination of the above answers. TA's lecture notes are posted before tests - compare them to yours to study and you'll be fine.

RIGHT?"" she says it at the end of every sentence I'm not even kidding. you can't even pay attention while she's lecturing because her speech is that poor",She constantly wasted time with pointless slides that had nothing but pictures on it and waited in silence for people to answer he inane questions. Just all around awful.,"Her class was absolutely awful, in four years I have never been motivated to actually review a professor until I had her. This class was highschool material but she constantly insists on asking questions like what is a hypothesis to 100 people and waiting for a response with the answer on the slide. Tests are fairly hard designed to trick you.",Professor Punyasena is very nice and helpful. She gives good explanations and has informative and interactive powerpoints.

TA's are much more helpful!!,She makes Elementary Math harder than it has to be.,"She's just not good at teaching. And she doesn't know much about math, either, at least not enough to be a college professor. People often ask her questions and if she doesn't know the answer, she spends 20 minutes trying to figure it out! Also, completely UNREACHABLE. She admittedly doesn't respond to emails or phone calls. Good LUCK",I have never had a worse teacher in my entire life! its probably mandatory for you to take this class if ur in the college of ed but seriously whenever she has a question on the review packet and then she goes over it make sure you ask her verbatim what she will give points for.... HORRIBLE TEACHER! fairly easy class that she makes kinda difficult,I feel sorry for anyone taking any class with Sue. I'm taking math 117 and it basically is to teach you how to teach children math by relating it to things they understand(Sounds fun and easy)........my thoughts exactly however Sue is a HORRIBLE explainer and I would feel sorry for any kids she had to teach!,Horrible teacher. Can't teach to save her life. I had to go to a different Lecture because she couldn't explain a thing. Worst teacher of my college career thus far.,Worst college teacher I've had. She doesn't know the materail so don't bother asking questions. I learned all of the material from the book.,"The class is pretty easy and the review packets are really helpful... Her TA's, at least the one I had, kinda sucked so try to get on their good sides or else you're not gonna get an A. Also, recheck your test points because a lot of times they don't add them correctly and you wanna make sure you get all the points you deserve.",Not very helpful at all. Had no idea what she was teaching.,"Doesnt teach very well, but class material was easy enough if you know some math. Students correct her too much for being a professor in math and teaching a lower level course. She takes forever to answer emails. I entered the class late and couldnt do the first assignment so I emailed her to excuse it. Still hasnt as of the day of the final.","I took her for both math 103 and 117 and she is the worst teacher. She knows absolutely nothing about math. Luckily the concepts are easy to grasp and you don't even need a teacher to teach you. The Ta's are better than her as are the students in class, they constantly correct her and she makes simple mistakes. I got an A but she is just horrible.","Honestly the worst teacher I have ever had during my entire education. I had her for 103 and 117 &amp; she had no idea what she was teaching. The students and TA's knew more than her &amp; she often asked questions &amp; was being corrected. The classes were both super easy though. Exams are the same as the reviews, so just memorize them. But shes horrible.",I had her for both 103 &amp; 117. Terribly dull- I would never have gone to lecture if she didn't take attendance. She acts like none of her students have ever been exposed to the simple concepts we all learned way back in jr. high. Makes math errors such as calculation slope as change in x over change in y and adding numbers wrong. Avoid if possible.,Don't take her class whatever you do.  When taking math it is important to have a good teacher that you can depend on. She doesnt even know what she is talking about.  She refers to her notes just to add 1 + 1. She is constantly making mistakes because students are correcting her. IF YOU WANT A GOOD GRADE IN MATH DO NOT TAKE HER CLASS!,"If you KNOW math this class is probably easy, but if you are ok. DONT TAKE IT!! She did not teach that good, so if you Have to talk pre-cal get in another section, because the explanations were horrible. i took calculus and the class was not the easiest. it is not hard, but this class is boring and MathZone basically teaches u everything.","Really easy class, but lectures are pointless.  She talks sooo slow about simple concepts.  If attendence wasn't taken no one would ever come.  I fell alseep every time and still got an easy A.  I would still recommend the class just because it's such an easy gen ed.",worst teacher ever.,"She took over for Carol Castellon, and tried to use all her material but didnt understand it since it wasn't her own.

The feedback she gives in very helpful and if you use it, no doubt you'll get an A in the class.","Isabel is a cool person, has a fun sense of humor and really like feedback from students.

Sometimes he's a little underprepared and we don't really do anything all day, but overall, I recommend.","Dr. Rabern keeps things lively in lecture, and really cares about the topics.  I learned alot of new and exciting information that I have shared with friends and family. I took this course just for the credit and ethics sounded interesting. But I'm now a vegetarian!","As a senior I have taken a lot of horrible classes at this university, but this must have been one of the worst. I have never had such an unprepared teacher, whose lectures made no sense and who spend 6 weeks talking about the same topic. Do not take this class unless you wanna fall asleep in lecture","You don't really need to read the readings he assigns since he explains it thoroughly in class. You probably only need to read through it when you need to write a paper. No exams, just homework assignments and papers.",I love this guy. Everyday is a weird adventure. I wish all classes were like this.,He's a cool guy and he makes lectures somewhat amusing. He doesn't put much effort into making the material interesting which is something philosophy needs. He's okay overall,"He does a good job of explaining stuff. Sometimes people in the class are so confused that its painful. But I don't think its his fault.

She's sweet, witty, funny, leads great discussions, and really teaches you how to read primary sources and interpret history.

As long as I talk to her about my struggles before.  LOVE HER!,"Wow, while this is a 200 level class, Prof. Rabin seriously makes it very challenge with very unique teaching styles. She made a very painful experience on topics. She is very sharp. The most difficult thing was there were no clews on what she talks. The lack of clarity made it kinda tough.","I'm an engineering major, so I thought taking this history class would be boring. But she made it SO interesting! I really enjoyed going to class. You can tell she is VERY passionate and loves what she does, and it shows through her lectures. She expects a lot from students, but genuinely cares. This is a class you should definitely take.","Professor Rabin is very helpful and an interesting scholar. Her classes are full of discussion and while reading the textbook is not necessary, reading the readings in her course packet IS. Exams in 256 are all written essays but you can be creative and explain your point of view. Great course, great professor.","Professor Rabin is very vibrant and approachable and I liked learning from her. We didn't crack open the textbook once, but there were TONS of outside readings. In class she favored letting us discuss instead of lecturing. This was good for the essays because they were geared towards these readings. However tests were a nightmare w/out lecture","Took Hist256 as a first semester freshman expecting to be overwhelmed by this class, but in fact it was fairly easy. Prof is very nice, straightforward, understanding, and actually is concerned about students progress. Reading the primary source documents is important, reading the textbook not as much.

I attempted this course in the spring, the other instructor never taught the course. Ryan makes every effort to make sure everyone understood concepts. He does expect you to KNOW the material and his exams are HARD, but is available to everyone and honestly wants you to succeed. One of the best professors at the UIUC for sure!","He makes chemistry bearable and is willing to explain things until you understand. If you are not the best in chem, buy the book he recommends and read each chapter. The book he chooses it great","He was a good teacher and also he was fairly available to help. On the other hand his exams were way too difficult compared to homework and quizzes etc. Not saying they should be easy but they should be similar to what we get for practice. I got an A so I'm not just bitter, I really think he does a bad job of preparing students for his exams.","He is the best professor I have ever had in this school.

You create your own grading contract.","Just attend the class, take notes, attend discussion section for additional notes and comments.  You have to decisions to make your own grading policy; percentage of assignment and exams.  You have to take all exams and submit at least one assignment.","Excellent teacher. Fun, energetic, and makes material very relevant. Good sense of humor. This is not a hard class if you just do the readings and participate every once in a while.","Awesome teacher. She will surely bring a smile to your face even at 8 am on a dark and gloomy day. Though, she may be leaving soon to obtain a higher paying job elsewhere so take 101 with her as soon as possible.

He wants his students to have their own opinions, and is easily approachable.","I had Prof. Ramsbottom for Hist 141. I really love History, so I enjoyed this class. He has outlines for each lecture which is posted on Compass. There are also quizzes on Compass, which questions appear on the exams. We also did debates in that class, which was enjoyable.

Also, they grade the essay portion insanely hard. You have 2 papers as well that can be graded hard or easy. A lot of reading, but I wouldn't do most of it. He's a nice guy. A B is doable. If you want an A- be ready to work really hard. Discussion assignments are dumb.",He's a good guy and a fair teacher. I enjoyed his class very much.

Take the rewrite paper policy to improve your grade.","Dr. Randolph did his best to help me through a thesis when I didn't have any real advisor. He was not in my field, but his advice got me infinitely further than I could have gotten otherwise.","While this is a 400level class, Prof Randolph really makes it easy and laid-back.

Group presentations, 2 papers,2 visualization projects and a final paper/project. Overall recommend for a good class experience.",Great teacher and turned a 400 level class into something that was easy to understand. He did not expect people to have any expertise in a class but wanted everyone to learn. If you have a chance to take a class with this professor DO IT.,Prof. Randolph is one smart man. He's a natural lecturer and is also very engaging during in-class discussions. I only saw him once during office hours and I really wish I had visited more often. He is so friendly and helpful. Above all(literally) he's a tall dude so it was refreshing to look a teacher in the eye for a change.,"Randolph is an excellent teacher that gets all students involved. He has been the only prof so far that made sure the class members knew each others' names in order to improve discussion. Friendly, even tempered, very smart, good lecturer. My only issue was not fully understanding his expectations for essays - sometimes his feedback was unclear.",He is an amazing lecturer. The discussion sessions are actually interesting because he can keep it going. Overall he is the best professor at the University.,"God know why they have a Russian History professor teaching The Enlightenment but he managed a pretty good job. The course is pretty simple, but often a pain considering that history majors have to take it. I would recommend taking a different section of 200 unless you really like Enlightenment.","Very nice man, the first teacher ever that made me want to contribute in class because he always seemed so interested in everyone's opinion.  Also, really helpful during office hours with essay writing advice.",Very smart - almost too smart - makes it very abstract and confusing at times,"It was clear that he knew what he was talking about and he worked hard to keep the class involved in the progression of the course. That said, he uses a lot (LOT) of grandeloquent rhetoric and thus lectures will leave you thinking: WTF did he just say?"

Very discouraging and unfair.,once picked a concertmaster that was one of the worst violinists in the section. are you kidding me?,As a conducting teacher he is very good.  He makes helpfull comments and is usually very kind.  My complaint is that everyone in the class got a B+ or B... no A's and no C's...,He does not know how to lead a college-level ensemble.  Philharmonia is awful!  Not a good conductor -- he never varies his style or size of pattern -- and does not prepare cues.  The winds are usually neglected and he sets low standards.

If you work hard, you will definitely be rewarded.",Basically follow the text book so that attendance is not necessary if you can read the book yourself. Grader is pretty harsh... Exams are easy since she gives review sheets. We can bring a cheat sheet to the final and the 2nd midterm. Not many proofs but many calculations.,"Professor Rapti is crystal clear in lecture and in her expectations for homework and exams. Before each exam, she gives out a review sheet that tells you what to look over. Very fair grader. Some of material can get difficult. Only part I didn't like was that sometimes, the exams tested your algebra manipulation rather than PDEs understand.","Professor Rapti pretty much teaches from the book and does problems from the book in class as examples. The book has the answers in the back, so you should average very high homework scores. She gives GREAT review sheets, which let you know pretty much exactly what you need to know for the exam.

Exams and homework are very fair, and she doesn't try to trick you.","She is one of the best math teachers I ever had.

In summary: great professor to have!",she knows what shes doing but doesnt really teach the material. mostly she just goes through exactly what the book says and does a step by step example. as long as you copy the examples you should be able to do the hw. she doesnt really explain anything so if your bad at teaching yourself find another professor,"A bit hard to understand, due to the accent.  Weekly quizzes weren't bad.  Exams were a bit tough, but gave GREAT review sessions before exams, saved my grade.

Her lectures consist of her repeating the same unclear explanation over and over. Verbally insists on excessive levels of showing work on exams but also imposes harsh time constraints which makes writing all of the work extremely difficult. Find another prof.,She did a poor job on clearly the explaining the contents. Whats most astonishing is that she even forces everyone to take Final on another date than whats written on the syllubusannouncing it only a few days ahead of time. I don't understandboth the contents and what she thinks.,"This class is geared to be low stress. Ravat offers a flexible exam option where the final is optional. If you wish to do well enough on the two midterms you may skip the final exam, or take it to replace your midterm scores. The homework is time consuming but manageable. She is knowledgable but spends too much time asking for volunteers in class.",Amazing person!!! Loved her class. She is so sweet and knowledgeable about the subject material she teaches. Always willing to help students with any issues they have. Interesting and engaging lectures. Would definitely take this class again!!,"Worst professor I've ever seen. Her lectures were unorganized and dry, basically just reading through the slides. She couldn't answer students' questions effectively and sometimes made mistakes about the easiest formulas we need to know in class. Grading process was too slow. Not recommend taking her class. SO BAD!","I was not a fan of Prof. Ravat's lectures. They were dry, and I found it easier to teach myself course concepts. She provides many online resources (practice problems, fill-in-the-blank notes, practice tests) that completely supplant the textbook and make skipping lecture a decent idea. Mideterm grades are replaced by the final, making an A easy.","I would say, it is not a good idea to choose Uma if there are some other profs also teach this class. Even though she is respectful, she was unhelpful on the homework and lecture was unorganized. The grading is fair but the workload is heavy. Both lecture and textbook are confused sometimes, so Good Luck.",She was is a nice person and her lecturing skills are decent. I had her for stat 400 and the good thing about her was that her tests were easily (but there was no curve at all). If you go to lecture and do the homework you should be fine.,If you are a math person who is a visual learner such as myself then I would recommend this professor. She works through problems which is what I need to learn from. I actually changed going from my old professor's lectures to hers because they were more valuable in regard to my time. The exams are average but the final replaces the two midterms.,"The course was extremely easy. Everyone got B or above &amp; many got an A. However this teacher is not a good lecturer. If you are prone to falling asleep in boring lectures I guarantee that will happen here too. Also, self-study instead of lectures etc is better than attending class. She is a good person and very kind. Therefore I give her 2 points.",Worst professor I've ever seen. Used other prof's lecture notes and homework. The course is disorganized and her lecture was horrible. Little feedback of homework and exam provided. I thought 428 would be a coding course but she never used a computer during the lecture. I doubt if she really understands the materials.,Disorganized class and homework. Even exam schedule is not clear. Change exam date 5 days before the exam while I have already set up an off-campus job interview at that day.,"I was originally not looking forward to this class. However, this class was the opposite of what I expected. There are 3 exams and a final. They are all not so bad because there are practice exams given. There is homework everyweek. All in all, I would take this course again if I had to.",I skipped 65% of the lectures and still got an A. Everything you need is on Lon-Capa.,Professor Ravat  genuinely takes the time to get to know her students in the lecture hall and will assist anyone when they have a question. Lectures always felt very comfortable and engaging. STAT100 as a course itself is very easy (in my opinion) so you will not be learning anything too hard but Ravat definitely made it clear and accessible.,"One of the first classes at UIUC; Made me think: ""Hey! College is Easy!""... Then I took Econ....","She's a sweet teacher! Good teacher, easy class, don't worry. Go to office hours if stuck on a concept, she'll help. The ""textbook"" is our incomplete notes book which we also get extra credit from (on top of all the bonus prelectures, surveys, and clicker points) at the end of the year given we have completely filled it out and it's definitely used"
2011693,3.5,Saiprasad,Ravishankar,1,0.6354751991914391,"This was his first time teaching a course. He was a good professor. He goes very fast, his handwriting can get pretty difficult to read at times, and he demands answers from the class during his examples. That being said, he approaches his students and asks them for feedback and opinions on a daily basis and actually caters to their needs."

He gives you everything you need to be successful in the class, and he sometimes brings his kids to lecture.",He is a great lecturer. His tests are more straight forward then CHEM102. Don't need to go to class even though there are clickers because he posts video which are easier to understand on LonCapa. Ray also is good at explaining and answers all your questions thoroughly. Great teacher,Dr. Ray is the best chemistry professor I have ever had. He genuinely cares about his students which was evident on the first day when he made an announcement about caring about student mental health. He is vey busy but usually is available outside of class and puts in a lot of effort to help you succeed.,Dr. Ray is the most amazing professor that I have ever had. His lectures are easy to understand because he takes scary topics and breaks them down. Take good notes and do all the practice exams. Make sure you ask if you do not understand something! Dont let questions build up. Hes always available before and after class. Great prof and class!,"Ray was a gem -- if you have the opportunity to take him, I HIGHLY recommend you do so. This is not to say that his exams were easy (they were rather tricky), but he was FAIR throughout the entire semester. As long as you participate in lecture, take good notes, DO THE PRACTICE EXAMS, and just spare some time throughout the week, you will be gold.","Dr. Ray is one of the BEST professors one could ever have! Do not defer the opportunity to have him as a professor. His exam questions are slightly convoluted and tie multiple things together, but as long as you understand the concepts, it's not all that bad- he does not try to trick you on exams! He will go out of his way to help you succeed.","Honestly the best professor I've has at this University so far. I found him extremely funny and was very knowledgeable about the subject. Exams need a pretty big time commitment to do well, homework is relatively easy. Put in the time and this class is very doable.","Makes you work extremely hard to keep your grade up in the class, seems to be easy to pass, but with what grade you want is to be determined how hard you work and understand the material. Tests sometimes don't exactly reflect the material taught in my opinion. Overall, would not say this is an easy A, but an easy pass is definitely a possibility.",Dr. Ray is the best professor I have ever had. His lectures are easy to understand and he does not speak too fast. His office hours are wonderful and he will remember you by name. The project isn't bad as long as you get a group of people that actually do work.,Dr. Ray is a good professor but his exams are pretty difficult. Don't think you can pull your grade up with them for the most part. Do all the little homework assignments and get them all right and you will have some padding for the exams. He has a group project for some lectures that sucks so make sure to start early on it.,"You need to go to lecture, and he can be intimidating at office hours, but he's a nice guy.","Professor Ray is an amazing teacher. His gives a lot of resources to help prepare for tests and his tests are similar to those materials. He doesn't curve, but he does give every student a chance to ""earn a curve"" by doing an online retake with multiple tries. These helped my grade a significant amount!","Dr. Ray is extremely knowledgeable, and always seems to love to come to class. He makes lectures interesting, and is always there to help you if you need ANYTHING. I wish I could take every chemistry class with him as my teacher - he is awesome!",I thought he was amazing!  Really great at coming to lecture early and had good office hours at the CLC.,Gives you everything you need to do well on exams but they can be a bit tough. easily one of the best professors i've had so far on campus,"As much as Ray was a very nice professor, he was extremely difficult. He was a good lecturer &amp; I performed well on homework and quizzes, but majority of the class grade is from exams. He states at the beginning of the semester that he challenges you on the exam with questions you haven't seen before. Easy to perform poorly on them &amp; kill your grade","This is my favorite professor to date. Given that I am just a freshman, take that with a grain of salt, but I have previously taken Chem 104 in high school and retook it for a grade boost, and the way he teaches the concepts is very similar to my high school teacher. He really walks through exactly how to do problems and makes lecture fun.","The only redeeming quality of this class was the online lecture videos. He talks constantly about his own life, and never replies to emails. He is late in posting on Ion Capa and his grading system is very test heavy. He is a nice guy but really shouldn't be a teacher. Puts little time into the class.","He's a good lecturer but that's about it. Takes weeks to reply to emails. Is always late up loading exam material therefore, giving students very little time to study. The answer keys were littered with mistakes. You will end up knowing more about his personal life rather than chemistry. Would not recommend."

An A requires excellence. Where is the rubric for ""excellence"" then? His prompt is confusing so make sure you are in his section because different TAs offered diff explanations &amp; examples.",Nathan was by far the best TA for RLST 110. He made the class great. I loved going to discussion! The only difficult part of the class is the paper. He grades a little hard but overall the class is pretty easy.,"Overall the lectures of this course were horrible.  Nate's discussion is the only reason I understood anything in this class.  If you take this class, make sure you get Nate as a TA.  Students in other sections always ask me for notes from his section because they know how well he presents the material to his students!","I took this class last year (spring '12) and I dont know what everyone is talking about. The class was not hard at all. I barely ever went to lecture (missed half the iclicker points), didnt read the book (except the vocab terms 15 min before class) and I got an A-. And seriously, Im not a genius or a good writer. Nathan's just a really nice guy.",boring and annoying. he grades papers expecting all students to be a RLST major. too hard to be a 100 level class,"he is a bad TA! poorly organized class, hard exams that require students to memorize the entire book, getting a good grade for a paper is hard. this class could be really interesting, but he totally ruined it. DONT TAKE RLST 110 AND DONT GET RAYBECK AS YOUR TA",He is the worst! he is really mean and he doesnt care about students. He thinks he is the smartest guy in the world because he teaches the most ridiculous religious class. You wont learn anything taking this class and if you work hard you will get a B,"Lecture for this class sucks. I suggest not even taking it at all. Nate is a nice TA, he does good explanations but when contacting him out of class he is rude and he wont keep up his promises and he wont be helpful. it is easy to get a B but to get an A you would have to work really hard, a lot more than what makes sense for a stupid gened.","just don't do it. not an easy grader, not nice at all","Nate's discussions are way more productive than the boring lectures for this class. Definitely an A in this course if you study a bit but I missed a surprise quiz (that was 5%), so got an A-. I would recommend this TA and course but be prepared to put in some amount of effort if you had very little idea on that religion beforehand.","Best TA I've ever had. All-around awesome guy, that's very willing to help his students.",I personally thought the course was extremely dry and boring. I really didn't learn much at all from the class since you're taught only to regurgitate information. I don't agree with his teaching style. Many times I felt the quizzes were 'gotcha' questions. You have to read a chapter of 25+ terms but only two are on the quiz. Lame.,"The best TA i've had, make sure you get him for World Religions.  Very helpful and funny.  He cares a lot about his students.  The class is pretty easy and not that much work, but I just messed up on the quizzes given at every discussion so I got a B, make sure you attend class and you should be guaranteed an A or B.",

Class involved writing assignments, quizzes, EC, exams, and one group project. I really enjoyed this class!","Fun professor and has a real passion for his class. It is relatively easy as long as you pay attention. I took it online and he makes it so you have to look up the answers and takes quite a bit of time, but they aren't terribly difficult. Class just had 2 research articles and two exams and you had a week to do each.",Crazy professor and easy class. Exam contains quiz questions. Take his class if you want A.,Give hard quizzes and tests,"Rayburn is crazy, but a pretty good teacher! He made the class easy and gave a ton of extra credit. The material was interesting and there were pop quizzes so attendance was key, but he drops 3 quizzes. Only had 3 exams and he took all the questions from the quizzes and put them in the exams. 1 group project at the end but not bad. Overall easy A",He restructured the online class so it's not so easy anymore. Quizzes/exams are tough in that it's timed and you can only go through one question at a time and you cannot go back to previous questions! There's also fill in the blank where you need to type in the answer. Very passionate about the class but not an easy A class.,"This class was an enjoyable gen ed. Rayburn is a real fun guy and his lectures were always entertaining. There are three tests and 10 or so pop quizzes. He puts the questions from the quizzes on the tests. There is a group project. You research a topic and do a presentation/video. If you want a good grade, always go to lecture. Tons of extra credit","While the info that we learn is pretty straightforward, the questions on the exams are intentionally tricky. In many cases there are two answers that mean the exact same thing... overall, this class was more frustrating than it had to be.  Side note: he looks like Santa Claus and he's hilarious. But his exams made me dislike the class.","This was an easy A. All you have to do is show up to the online lectures/discussions. Which are MANDATORY. He takes attendance randomly, multiple times a session. Quizzes are fairly easy. The final is pulled from a test bank, which  is a compilation of many quizzes.

Truly one of the best teachers at U of I.","Class is very casual and he tells a lot of stories while sneakily throwing tons of information on you that seems very easy on the surface. His test shied away from what he said were the most important topics and focused more on seemingly unimportant, ""got you"" questions. Very good guy, but not for those who like structure and clear material.","Raycraft is a funny and pretty decent teacher. With AHS199 (James Scholar class), The Fan Experience, he does very little teaching as the entire class is essentially group presentations on academic articles.

Really knowledgable about marketing, I learned a lot. show up and you'll do fine","BEST professor, cares for his students. wish i could retake the class.",I would say attendance isn't mandatory but h gives out random quizzes sometimes.  He is a great professor that really makes the lecture interesting and funny.  I actually enjoyed going to this class and was sad when it was over!,"Raycraft is hilarious.

But always complaning in front of the class about having to grade papers and blah blah. So she definitely does not want to be there. This is not encouraging students at all. SHE chose to be a TA...  And her clothing style may be different as she says, but it's totally wack.",Good TA.  Class was fun.,"I loved her.

Just two papers &amp; tests. some things were interesing,"Kinda dry and slow at times. But, the material was interesting overall.",All Depends on the Ta! Lectures are interesting but have to take notes by hand and she talks really fast. Must read the textbook because alot of test questions come from there. Hopefully get a good Ta or they can wreck your grade on the Papers. Gives extra credit. Tests are multiple choice and essay. Must read primary sources (alot) or else fail,Probably the worst professor I've ever had. She gives terrible lectures and makes the class extremely hard. I didn't learn anything and dreaded going to class. I highly recommend not taking her class.,The course schedule is not very organized and the difficulty of the first quiz was way beyond the requirements of a 100 level class.,She stands up in front of the lecture hall with a power point full of pictures and you can't use your computer to take notes.

This class was the best I have taken at U of I; very interesting discussion, 1 short paper, 1 long paper, no exams, and fun smaller assignments throughout.

Exams were simple and she gave out a lot of candy.","Well, to start off she lived under a rock growing up. Not only that but she's very old and teaching about media which didn't really exist much while she grew up. This entire class seems opinionated and half the stuff she teaches is OBVIOUS.

She's not too strict and made me laugh several times. Class topics were interesting to me.",She is INSANE. She is soo confusing.

Good luck to any logical u of i kid attempting to navigate this course.",Super easy course as long as you  go to all of the classes.

Her class is my FAVORITE class this semester. All of the work is in-class (no homework), the exams are fair, it's easy if you pay attention. She genuinely cares about her students and tries to make everything as clear as possible.

Grades are given in super strict ways, and the explanation does not make sense",He's an amazing teacher and interacts with the students and likes to crack jokes a lot. An easy class just a lot of busy work. Just show up do the work and you'll pass.
1470224,5.0,Aimee,Rickman,1,0.48871612644131746,I didn't know what to expect from this class. There was a lot of material. Aimee's discussions tied together ideas making it so much more understandable and she gave real life examples. She really cared about us learning in the course. One of the best teachers I have had at UofI.
654541,4.4,Franklin,Ridgway,16,0.5574184911921037,I love this guy! He is a perfect rhet teacher. Lectures are a little dry tho. Hes extremely helpful and I learned a lot in his class. Frank rocks!,You couldn't ask for a better rhetoric teacher. And he is pretty funny and really nice guy,"Had to take the class after getting a 31 English on the ACT. If you have to take RHET, take it with Frank because he is very helpful and interesting. he also hates the newer Star Wars movies and so do I so rock on Frank! I got an A+ in the class with minimal effort but I'm an English scholar so that's to be expected.","I've never taken a college level English class and have never had any interest in taking one.  Frank was very interested in helping us understand what was going on in the books.  While some professors suck at teaching and are making 6 figures, Frank was one of the best instructors I have had at this University.","I love this class even tho it's not that easy.  He's really nice and helpful, and very cool judging by his office taht has bobbleheads :)","He was very interested in the topics and made reading these books interesting. Sometimes I found myself daydreaming when he talked a lot but the class was pretty easy, and he was easy on papers.",Best Professor I've ever had and probably will ever have. He was extremely helpful. His assignments are interesting and not too difficult. Great Teacher I highly recommend taking one of his classes.,Not much to say other than he's alright and expects you to do the work. I guess I earned my B. In some other class it would have been an A but I liked the class fine.,Great teacher. Very helpful.,"A great TA and a really smart teacher. Very helpful in office hour, and doesn't talk down to you. He's probably like 35 but seems a lot younger.",Great! He was always very helpful when I came to office hours. He is very nice. He grades fairly easy. Attendance is mandatory.,"absloutely loved him. if u have to take this class take it with frank.he is a VERY easy grader and u will get an A if uparticipate. its a****ty class to begin with and requires some reading, but if u dont read, u can still bs your way through the class period. DEFINATELY TAKE him and dont switch out of his class, its easy, though boring sometimes","Frank is such a great guy and awesome teacher! If you just ask him for help and talk to him about the class/papers/etc. your bound to get an A. Participating in class is the key to getting the A too, just give your opinion on everything.","Was an extremely easy grader and very flexible with students needs. Kinda dorky and rambles a LOT, but more or less keeps the class interesting.  Was a nice guy, especially when you go in to his office hours for help.","I liked his teaching style. He seems like a dork kind of at first, but then secretly I had a secret crush on his dorkiness. SHH! It's a secret!","Frank was a really reasonable guy, very nice, and would give pretty insightful comments if you talked to him about your papers. I would reccommend him, he didnt assign extremely hard papers and I think there were 3-4 papers for the entire semester. I wasted money buying the book, which he hardly ever used."

Make sure you get all your books! Do the reading and talk a bit in class and you'll easily get a good grade. I wish I could take more classes with him but they don't fit in my major. Ridgway is a good teacher! :)"

Not worth going, except sometimes he has pop quizzes that are worth between 2-10 bonus points on tests. Don't trust his syllabus, he doesn't stick to it worth anything. Poor teaching, scattered, and it seems all he cares about is his research."

I had to change my thesis which changed my entire paper a day before it was due. Who does that?! He is completely narrow minded. Bottom line - Don't take him.",I went into this class expecting an easy class that would not do much for my writing. The class was tougher than expected but I finished a  better writer. Austin is a great instructor and will take the time to clarify how  you can improve. If you seriously want to improve your writing take this class.,"Austin is a very nice person. His grading is very tough, but it caused me to become a better writer. Word of advice: take risks, be different, and personalize your essays. Boring and cliched papers will get you a lower grade. Also, be active in class. This is NOT an easy-A class like others say, so prepare to work for that A, but i would recommend.","Austin is so annoying, he complains about everything then gives all his students C's and B's.  Writing an A paper is nearly impossible, and he just dishes out B's like nobody's business.  He loves to assign pop quizzes the SAME DAY THE PAPER IS DUE because he hates his life and wants his students to be miserable.  I only learned how to BS a paper.","Your writing will improve with Austin.He is very intelligent,and an interesting person.He does not give out good grades,but if you meet his clear expectations and make an honest effort you will do fine.Take advantage of his office hours,he critiques your paper and tells you what to fix.I am a better writer because of him,but it was not easy work.","Not as easy as all the other students claimed him to be... you actually need to meet his expectations! However, these are clearly stated and if you go in for additional help ... he'll gladly assist you. Plus really interesting discussions... really funny professor.","Austin is awesome, but this semester he gets really harsh on papers and readings. We've had lots of pop quizes about the readings. Probably he knows that previous students say his class is easy, he now gets really really harsh! Students in our class are definitely struggling. But he is a really good instructor!","Austin was a really good instructor, but for a 100-level English course, this was way too demanding. The readings took a really long period of time to complete. The papers were tough because he is pretty strict on writing. Also, I did enjoy the discussions held in class. Austin really allows you to speak your mind.","Clear, funny, and really wants the students to learn. The class never gets boring with Austin. Easy class, though not a complete blowoff.",Austin is very... different to say the least but in a very positive way. His approach is very unique and down to earth. He is no way intimidating nor does he make you feel awkward about your answers but encourages any comment you might make and relates it to the class. Overall he's awesome.,Easiest English class in my life!,"If you walk into his class already having taken AP Lit or any other intensive English class, this will be a joke. Great man, very basic expectations. Cancels class 3-4 times a month. Shows movies. Gives great paper assignments. IF YOU TAKE RHET 105 IT MUST BE WITH AUSTIN! I hear other sections are unbearably hard, but his is a joke if you try a bit","If you mess us on a paper, he lets you redo it. It is almost impossible to get a C in his class. He told us what he expected and if you did that, you usually got a solid grade.",Very responsible and helpful teacher. Also a humorous guy.,No Comments,"Good teacher. He was very helpful and had good discussions with the class. But, he is very opinionated. I got good grades on all the papers, he really wants the people in his class to be better writers and it shows with the help he gives us."
572831,3.5,Chad,Rienstra,6,0.5196205392144259,Great proffessor.  Always willing to answer questions and clarify.  Also has a good sense of humor.  Tests are very difficult due to the lack of many helpful example problems and because no partial credit is given.  Overall good professor.,Dude is jacked!,"Really lively and fun to listen to, so it really helps with a topic that is often boring or confusing. He'll always stop to make a point clear if someone doesn't understand, and he posts just about everything online all the time. Overall a great prof for a difficult class",No Comments,"The first time he taught the class, and it showed. Horribly disorganized, lectures had no start and no end. He's obviously smart but he hasn't quite figured out how to shared his knowledge with his students.","Prof. Rienstra is a very clear teacher.  He might be a little over-caffeinated, but at least that keeps the lectures entertaining (tells lots of jokes).  Also, he must be at least 6'7"", so he really maximizes his use of the blackboard.  Quantum might suck, but this prof doesn't."
2122773,3.0,Chance,Riggins,1,0.34963515655203053,"He is a very nice teacher. This class was was very interesting, but the lectures were a bit boring. Everyday he lectures with PowerPoint and it gets a bit repetitive. He has a soft voice with not much personality in it so it is easy to fall asleep in class.

1786667,2.5,Elizabeth,Riley,5,0.5725376326951362,"Don't bother asking a question, she won't answer it well and will also make you feel stupid for asking. It's a lecture with like 200+ students, but she literally screamed at people for whispering. Just study really hard for the tests and you'll do okay. Stats is generally not that hard. Assignments are online.","She got really frustrated when people asked questions. She went really fast going over things and assumed we knew what she was talking about. I struggled to get a B in the class. If she offers extra credit.. DO IT, YOU WILL NEED IT!!!!",This class is basically easy and she allows you to bring note card without any exception what you want to write on it. Sometimes she came late to the class and even during the final exam although the time to finish the exam was more than enough.,"While she has a very good understanding of the material, she is not in any way helpful. She makes you feel stupid when you speak up in class and ask for help. She's very rude and critical, I would not recommend taking her course. Try finding another professor if you have to take STATS 100!","This was one of the best class I've ever had. Professor Riley is smart, nice, enthusiastic and a truly gifted teacher. She knows the material very well(she co-authored the textbook) and has a natural talent in explaining complex mathematical subjects in a simple way. Her course made me interested in studying statistics more in future."

This is by far the best class I have taken at the U of I. Rios is a good teacher, makes the topics easy to understand, and  he's pretty funny too. If you go to all the lectures and take notes, the exams are really fair. Great class!","I love Rios!  He's a very nice guy who is very passionate about the subject. He's goofy and sometimes makes silly jokes, but thats part of the fun. This class was easy, interesting and enjoyable. It also moved at a slow pace which made it easy to ACTUALLY learn the information.","I completely disagree. Rios' lectures are completely unstructured. He rambles, and puts little effort into any of his own tangible references for information. This class is not ""hard"" however Rios is one of the worst professors I've had to date on campus... beyond frustrating. Ask anyone (aside from above) if they liked class and they'll say NO.","This class and professor were great! The class and readings are interesting, and the tests are fair. I actually enjoyed going to class, and Prof. Rios made it enjoyable. If you go to class, pay attention, take notes, and do all the assigned readings, the class really is fair and fun! Take it!"

2173398,1.5,Eduardo,Rios-Neto,2,0.19124146047302704,Rios is hard to understand during lecture that's graded on attendance. Discussion was boring. I dropped off the worksheet and left. Exams were mostly easy. I didn't pay much attention. All lecture slides are online. Group work is also fairly easy.  I did not do much work and managed a B. They also gave the class extra points for the final grade.,"Good class, bad professor.  Rios is very hard to understand and goes extremely slow.  Class is not worth going to, but is iclicker is 10%. Class (FALL16) is insanely easy, study for a few hours before the midterm, split up the group essays amongst your group members throughout the semester, not a big time commitment at all."
1118597,3.0,Matthew,Rispoli,40,0.3539248153901082,I love Rispoli! He's such a nice guy. I really think he cares about his students. This class was really easy and really similar to SHS 200 but I couldn't imagine taking it with someone else!,"I really like him as a human; very funny, helpful &amp; you can tell  that he loves what he does. Not the most interesting lectures but interesting info. Exams are open book &amp; the book is really all you need to pass so get the book. Participation only goes up to 50 so once you get that you don't need to go to class. Quizzes on weekends, super easy.","Rent the text book - you can use it on the midterm and final. Trust me, you'll need it. Save the in class hand outs- you can use them on the mid and final. Take notes, he expands on the topics relevant to the class. However, he does spend a lot of time expanding theories. His grading scale is 90-100 A","Great class, he is very enthusiastic and you can tell he enjoys what he teaches. He is also funny.",Ridiculously easy for an Adv Comp. Supposed to be a full semester course but feels more like an 8 week course,"I honestly didn't know what to expect from this teacher, everyday was an exciting spectacle of ""what will he say or do today?"" He was very proud of being Italian so I think if you cooked him a nice pasta dinner you'd be his best friend. Quirky, unpredictable and a little off the cuff sometimes. Kind of had to teach myself in this class.","This class taught by Rispoli is challenging, but not impossible. He teaches in a way where you are not spoon-fed all the material.  You need to make an effort outside of class to get help if you are having trouble. I got a C on the midterm, but went to office hours every week after and got an A on the final and in the class.","I found this class and teacher very disappointing. He made the material much harder than it needed to be and was terrible at answering questions. His powerpoint slides were unclear and we weren't allowed to have computers. Overall, I thought this class could have been taught much more effectively.",I feel like I did not learn anything. He is horrible at answering questions and over complicated material that should be simple. Did not give helpful exam reviews. I felt like the class could have been really enjoyable with a different professor.,"One of the worst professors I've ever had. The class itself wasn't bad at first, but towards the end I dreaded going.  Tests are open note, but ridiculously hard. Rambles when questions are asked in class, awful at explaining simple concepts and gets frustrated when you ask him to re-explain things. Hard to talk to outside of class. Overall: AWFUL!","He's a strange character but he obviously enjoys the material. Sometimes he blabbers on about unimportant, tangential material, which makes it really hard to pay attention! The class is not hard, though. Tests are open book and are the only things graded besides homework (easy 10 pt quizzes) and activities (in-class and graded on completion)",I highly recommend that you take SHS 120 with Rispoli if you want an easy A.  The online quiz questions are taken directly from his powerpoints or the textbook and the exams are open book/open notes.  The only downside is that attendance is mandatory and you meet twice a week for lectures that last 2-2.5 hrs.,"Overall, good teacher.  Could be found to be annoying or agitating by most, but that is only if you are only looking to get a grade and nothing more.  Generally seems to care about the students.  Enjoyed the class.","Honestly, this class wasn't that bad.  Every discussion if you paid attention, you'd walk away with the subject of your paper, and if you did not, don't worry, he only takes the top 7 out of 14 papers you write.  Grading can be a little difficult at first, but once you get the hang of the outline, it shouldn't be a problem.  Overall not a bad class","Extremely rude teacher, doesn't seem to want to help students. Confusing submission directions for papers and he claims its the student's fault if they can't decipher which directions to follow. I have never this bad of a teacher in my life. Highly recommend not taking this class because of him.","this class was interesting but rispoli was awful. he was never accessible to students, talked in giant circles that confused the class every time and i felt as though he never had something concrete to offer discussions. overall, class was easy if you are a strong writer and can follow an outline. takes top 7 of 14 papers","Dr. Rispoli is literally my favorite professor I've ever had! He is kind, clearly enjoys the material, and He simply wants everyone to come to class and learn. Plus, he'd throw in corny jokes, which truly did pass the time. It's clear that he cares about his students, because He makes effort to know every student's name - even in a large lecture.","I am a senior, needed a class to get min hrs req. Most boring class I have ever taken. On top of it, Rispoli is by far the worst prof I have ever had. I think he enjoys trying to screw students over. Pointless class, quizzes every week about the painfully boring reading/movies you slept through the week before. Poor quality to say the least.",Terrible teacher.. Pointless class.. He even rates himself to make himself seem interesting which he is not. Drop the class or get another teacher,"I can honestly say that this is the absolute worst professor I have had in my college career. He is completely unreasonable, very difficult to get ahold of, and does not help students outside of office hours. He is extremely rude and does not seem to like his students very much."

Easy class, good teacher.","Ellen is super passionate about this topic and you can really tell she enjoys teaching it. Two 2 page paper were required. 3 exams held in class, multiple choice with a couple essays. A few easy opportunities for extra credit. Attendance is required (sign in sheet at the beginning of class). Didn't buy the book, didn't need it.",You'll hear that it's an easy A but the class actually requires a decent amount of studying to get a solid A.,Really easy class. Make sure you show up and sign the attendance sheet since it's actually worth quite a bit for your grade. Just look over the study guide she gives you before the exams as well as the readings and you'll get an A. The two papers are  really easy.,"This class is easy and interesting to take. You must attend lectures for her there is an attendance sheet. Also fill in miss parts in lecture slides during lecture, this will help for exams.","Easy class. Study the lecture slides and do the readings, and you will do great on the exams. Also, you MUST go to class or you won't get a good grade. It is not uncommon for class to be dismissed 30min early."

She is not concerned with students learning.,"By far the worst/hardest TA I've ever had! She refuses to answer questions if she believes they are answered on the syllabus and when grading, she is extremely nit-picky. It's either her way or you fail.","She is one of the worst TAs I've had in my academic career. She grades horribly and requires you to do so much more than what is needed. She is nitpicky on papers and has a specific way of doing things. If you don't adapt to her way, you won't get an A. Other students with different TAs had it much easier."
1717696,3.5,David,Rivier,16,0.4342292123935697,He makes things very clear and easy to understand. And I liked his jokes. Hes very smart and hes interesting and funny too. And i really appreciated the lecture videos being posted. He talks slowly so it was great to be able to watch his videos at twice the speed instead of going to class.,I attended all of his lectures but I liked how there was an option to not have to attend since all lectures are recorded. He taught the 2nd half of 252 and honestly was too slow for me but material &amp; exam-wise definitely doable. Very nice to get to know during office hours as well.,317 was unbelievable easy until the final. Our class had the highest percentage of As in the class than previous years so he made the final really hard to bring it down. I didn't think he'd be like one of those professors but that was a low blow that ruined everyone. I got a 97% on the first two exams but then a 67% on the final,"If you have the chance to take one of David's classes, I highly recommend doing so. I had him for both 252 and 317, and he is by far one of my favorite professors at UIUC. The material covered in 317 did have some dry parts, but his humor will help get you through it. You can tell he really cares about the success of his students and likes teaching","If you can find past exams, the first and second exams are just like them. I basically just studied the past exams and discussion worksheets and got near perfect scores for the first two exams. Not sure about the final yet, but I'm hoping it'll be just as easy. Currently have an A",easee peezee lemon squeezee____If you don't get A in this course___ Oh man___ Oh man...,"Lectures were pretty straightforward, plus they're posted online to review. He emphasized things that would be on the test through Lon-Capa and our discussion HW, so it helped me figure out what to study.  Reviewing the day's lecture online each evening helped me retain the info better for exams. Also don't bother buying the book, you don't need it",Very fair class. Exam questions were very straightforward if you knew the material. I really liked having the lecture videos too. Could get a little bit dry but would add funny tidbits. Also liked how we focused on how we know what we know (ie experiments) instead of just making us memorize what we know.,"I actually didn't mind Dr. Rivier's lectures. He would add in little humorous bits, and would try to connect the material to medical aspects as many students were pre-health. He records all of the lectures and posts them online afterwards, which was nice. Exam questions were straightforward, but he'd give credit if he worded one poorly.",He briefly subbed for us in 252 and I thought he was great so I took him for 317... God did things change. His slides are sloppy and tests are tough. Discussion was a disaster and did not explain at all what we should know. Lon-capa questions were open note yet still impossible. would not take again. NEVER again.,"He's a very below average professor. He is not at all that specific when he speaks about his material but he asks some of THE most specific questions on his exams. Basically, his exams are not really like what he expects us to know. Supposed to be easier than 250, but his lack of clarity makes it slightly more difficult. Would not take him again.","I really enjoyed the class with Dr. Rivier teaching it. The class content was straightforward, and I learned alot. I do not feel that his exams reflected what he wanted us to learn. Half of the exams are easy and straightforward, while the other half full of very long questions with several possible answers. Ambiguous as to which one he wanted",Took cell bio over the summer and he was very helpful in all of his lectures! His tests are really straight forward and fair so you can't really get upset at him for writing the questions. Everything's basically off lecture!,"In MCB 317, Rivier was a great teacher. The history of genetics - how we discovered what we know about it - is not an easy thing to explain, yet he did it well, straight to the point and covered the big picture. I like how he gave us the big picture look at it all, and left us with a good understanding of most the techniques used in genetics.","Dr. Rivier's lectures are straight forward, but very dry. His powerpoints are not well organized. His exams are easy but poorly written. I do not recommend purchasing a book for this class. It's not used in lecture and the class is easy enough.","At the start of his half he claimed he would go fast and cover big picture ideas. Neither of these things were true. He droned on about topics you learn in high school and then gave tests that tested how well you memorized his slides. Although his questions were extremely easy, especially compared to Bellini or 250, they were poorly worded."

He offers extra credit and curves if needed.,"Very cool guy. Really interested in what he's saying, made class enjoyable. One of the best professors I've had.",He is quite a character. Really funny and made going to lecture fun. His tests were not bad-straight from lecture notes. One of my favorite classes!,He is extremely knowledgeable about the subject and I thought the material was very interesting. My complaint is that he claims that statistics show that review sheets don't actually help and he reinforces this belief by not offering a very thorough review sheet or review session. They sure helped in my other psych courses,"I found his portion of the class interesting and his exams were easy despite him saying ""My exams are really difficult""..well maybe to Psych majors. His favorite topic is clearly himself and he starts out sentences loud then slowly starts mumbling until you can't understand anything. I studied a day and a half prior to exams and got a 95%, easy.","Lectures are a must if you wanna do well on exams. He is a good lecturer and presents interesting material. Only criticism: he once gave his opinion on a debated topic and talked about it as if the other view was, well, stupid. I held the same opinion as him, but I just don't like it when professors do that. I don't know, maybe others won't mind.",AMAZING Prof! Kept lectures interesting and used engaging material. As long and you go to lecture and read a decent amount you'll be fine. He's also super willing to meet and answer questions. Too bad he doesn't teach the entire semester!,Really great teacher. gives good examples and is pretty thorough with subject matter. He's also cited in every psych textbook I've seen which is pretty cool,"Very good Prof! Lectures were extremely interesting- He's hilarious! Don't be fooled by nonchalant demeanor though- Expects you to know everything he has talked about/assigned, but it's not impossible to get an A at all. Read what's assigned and go over the lecture notes and you're golden.","This guy is extremely funny. Enjoyed going to class, but his test is RIDICULOUSLY hard, he said the average was a C on all of his tests. Just what I got. Don't really need to go to class, everything he says is on the slides, and it doesn't matter as its not on test.","He is one hot professor! He makes the material really interesting, and the lecture notes are online. So going to class is pretty optional. I only went because he was so darn cute. A very easy class.

You don't need to go to the lectures because he posts them online, but I went for his wit and personality in teaching. This is pretty basic biology though. His tests are a bit tricky because they often focus on minute details, but he curves well.","Boring. You can skip every single lecture and just print the notes off the website and review in your own time for the tests and squeak by with a C. Don't bother with the book.

It was fairly easy though, and i hate history.",Disregard anyone who posts negative things about him.

By far the best professor I have ever had at UofI and I'm a history major.,"Pretty boring lectures, but take the main points of what he's trying to convey. Only bought one book for the class because I needed it for a paper. Talk in discussion so the TA won't feel the need to give quizzes.",His lectures are impossible to understand and the notes he puts on the overhead are useless without 100% attention to what he is talking about.  This is NOT your average history class and focuses completely on the argument of history rather than the facts.  Do not take if you are just covering a GEN. ED. for history! Seriously- not worth it!,"Lectures are a bit boring, though history is presented in a way unlike any high school history class. Attendance is checked during random lectures and counts toward participation points. Make sure to ask questions during section. In the end, I only took notes for probably 35% of lectures and I anticipate getting an A :)","A brilliant professor.  Very articulate and well spoken.

His lectures are ridiculously crafted and the man is brilliant. If you have the PRIVILEGE to take a class with this man, do so.",He is a self arrogant person who pushed his own ideas on you while boring you to death!,"He seemed alright when I took his class, although he definitely liked to hear himself speak.  He is definitely liberal, but at the time I thought he presented his views as opinions, not as the only option.  However, he was instrumental in getting the Chief banned, so I want nothing to do with him.","I'm pretty sure he's high 24/7. If you have him, check out how he poses with his hand on his hip about every 15 seconds. Hilarious!","Good class to take, but I couldn't stand Roediger.

A lot of times he made mistakes in his powerpoints and could not explain the material. He defers from the textbook for some of the concepts he covers which makes things a little difficult.

This class takes a lot of effort, but it is very practical.","He was charismatic and appeared to genuinely enjoy teaching.  Some said course was difficult, however, he offered plenty of extra credit - and I noticed the ones who labeled the course difficult were also the students who claimed they didn't study.  Pay attention in lecture, take notes - he's a very fair grader.  Love taking classes with him."

We got study guides for each exam and the actual exam was the same exact thing with the questions in a different order.,"One of the best. Pay attention, do your work, and you'll do great. He really is so passionate about teaching and wants all of us to succeed. 10/10","Dr. Roseman is one of my favorite professors at UIUC. He is super witty and sarcastic, and keeps the class engaged. It is nice to have a professor that doesn't take themselves so seriously and is really willing to connect with his students. I wish I had space in my schedule to take a class of his next semester!","There weren't any lectures, but if you paid enough attention and took notes, it would be okay because he tended to repeat and ask the same questions every time. There was no exam, but 3 or 4 writing assignments. The class was very casual and he sometimes forgot to post the assignments, but it really matter in the end.",He is he worst professor I have ever had. It is impossible to understand him during lectures because he mumbles and does not finish his sentences but instead makes jokes/comments to himself almost under his breath. He is unable to get lecture slides posted on time and when they do get posted the words are blocked. I learned nothing from him.,"Roseman is a great professor with a dark sense of humor. The class seems like it is going to be horrible in the beginning but DO NOT drop. For one, the class gets much easier. Beyond that? I learn more in his class in a day than I do in a week in my other classes. Roseman is hilarious and he truly cares about his student's education.","Three exams and one paper. Exams are moatly lecture-based but only reading the textbook and using the study guide given before exams would be fine as well. Though not listed as a prerequisite, ANTH 101 should be required before taking this class.",Class is extremely easy. I only attended for exams and recieved an A in the class. He gives you everything you need for the exams to study from. Great guy with a good sense of humor!,"Roseman realizes that this is a gen ed class. That being said 4 easy tests and 3 writing assignments that were simple. Take this class, read his notes and receive an A. Good sense of humor, will make fun of kids in class. Can get boring at times but overall solid professor","Very funny, and keeps you engaged","Awesome guy... SUPER sarcastic which makes him very entertaining.  Good way to wake up in the morning because it was at 8 AM.  Showed up to every class, but wasn't necessary.  Gives you most of the questions to the test before hand.  Very easy tests and take home assignments.  No book needed",Really easy professor for ANTH 101.  All you have to do is look over the online notes the night before the exam and you'll do fine.  Take home projects are easy as well.,Pretty awesome teacher. His lectures aren't very difficult to follow and he goes pretty slow so you don't miss too much. He gave study guides for all the tests that were very helpful. As long as you show up and take notes you should do fine.,"Heredity and Society was the topic. He loves evolutionary anything and gets really into it. I'm not a huge fan of DNA and genomic study so it was hard for me to read the books and come up with the paper response but somehow I still got an A. If you show up to class and show him you're willing, he'll give you a fair grade.",It was a great class which you can learn a lot. There were 3 multiple-choice exams in total and he curved everytime to make sure students who put effort in it will receive A. He gave out review sheet before every exam which makes it easier to study. There was also an extra credit assignment before the final. Class was easy and recommend this class.,"Dr. Roseman is an awesome professor. His cynicism and dark humor alone makes his classes worthwhile, but the material he teaches is also very interesting. Anth 240 was very easy when he taught it and the class helped me decide to become an anth major. Anth 441 is very hard, but still pretty interesting. He makes me chuckle.","He's a really nice guy, but his lectures could be better since he goes by pretty fast and he doesn't give you any powerpoint slides to copy off of if you fall behind a little bit. Could be better prepared. He definitely knows what he's talking about and the class is fairly easy. Go to class and participate if you want a good grade.","Dr. Roseman is an incredibly smart man, and it's easy to see he's passionate about his work. His tests were very fair; it was all lecture based. I never opened the book and got an A. So, as long as you go to lecture, take some notes, you'll do well on his exams.",It was extremely difficult to understand him.  He would mumble and and trail off on a lot of his points.  He never explained things clearly and expected the class to remember a lot from high school.,Roseman is very engaging. He is passionate about his subject and it shows. His lectures are fun and upbeat.

The test is hard but not for genius. I wish I could be smart. It's not the professor's fault. It's because i am too stupid.,"Insanely difficult exams, homework are very tedious and take a very long time. Didn't find lectures helpful at all.","i took this class with my friends.  i'm a senior in ece with 3.9+  ece gpa, and i scored single digits on first midterm, my friends have all 4.0 or 3.9+ gpa, and they got 20 or 30 in the exam. Average was 21. it's just humiliating. she is a very good lecturer and passionate for teaching, i enjoyed her lecture a lot. but wish i could be smarter.","Great person, very enthusiastic, and she does an amazing job presenting the material. You'll see that she understands the material very well but have some tissues ready after you take the first midterm to wipe your tears.",I hated her! Her tests were ungodly difficult and she had an attitude towards students in class. Do not take her class.,"Lots of people complained about her, but I liked her. She likes teaching, so that is a big plus. The material in the course sucks (in my opinion), but that is not her fault, I imagine. Bottom line is, she is not my favorite professor, but I would not mind taking a class with her again.","her exams are bad, and her teaching style worse. A computer could do a etter job",No Comments,"I agree that she is tough. BUT, IMHO, She really knows what she is teaching, and she loves teaching it! Again in my opinion, she is very clear, and although she gives a tremendous amount of homework, it's just for the good of the students. I defenately recommend taking a class with her IF you feel competent enough for the challenges you'll face!","Horrible. Just horrible. I wouldn't mind it so much, but she actually thinks she's a good professor. She even got so mad at the class that she stood there glaring at us for about 10 minutes. I agree with the first reviewer. She is absolutely ridiculous.","The absolute worst professor I have ever had by a lot. If you see her on your schedule, drop the class as fast as you can. Very unclear, doesn't answer questions, and you can't learn the material from the horrible book that shes chosen (Comer and Comer). Don't take her class no matter what."

Only benefit: his midterms are problems found within the study guides.","Gives daily worksheets that are very similar to exam questions. Though a bit messy and unorganized, presents material pretty well. Tests are very straightforward and a fair curve is given. Would recommend!","Intelligent man. Weird man. Bad teacher. Avoid taking his courses. He's very unhelpful and even unfair when he makes mistakes in writing his tests. He is a very funny guy, even though he doesn't try to be. This class is an easy A just because Calc 1 is an inherently easy course, but the fact that he is the professor only makes it harder.",lectures are useless,LECTURES=POINTLESS.  He rambles about useless information and problems that he can't even finish.  There is no use to take notes in lecture because he starts multiple problems without finishing a single one. Calculus was easy until I took his class. I had to use my book all semester and still had trouble. Avoid if possible!,LECTURES MAKE NO SENSE! Either you better remember what you learned about Calc before or you become best friends with your book/TA,"Worst teacher ever!! If you can avoid taking him, DO SO. I've taken calculus before, so I knew the material pretty well and my TA was brilliant so it saved me from ever having to go to lecture. If you have taken calculus before and did well, you might be fine, but otherwise pick a different teacher!!!!",Lectures are useless. He explains obscure problems that don't help to learn the material. My TA definitely saved me in this class.,"Lectures were absolutely pointless.  He focuses on obscure problems that we don't even need to know.  Don't get me wrong, Rosenblatt is a funny, quirky guy but his teaching methods are not effective.  As long as you have a TA who can explain things you should be ok.  Calc 3 was way easier than calc 2 despite not learning anything in lecture.","It's awful. He goes off on these stories that last so long, and completely waste time. When you need to know something, he might not get to it and just move on to the next lecture the next time or you'll get behind. Clarity isn't great either. He explains things in such a confusing way and if he does go into detail, it's way too much.","Easy A. Terrible teacher in lecture, but has hilarious stories to share! You will have to teach yourself the math from the textbook. If you can do the homework, you can do the tests. I recommend him. He speaks English.","Rosenblatt is a nice guy who can't teach that well. He lectures about things that aren't really in the homework and he gets distracted a lot. He also is terrible at answering questions. However, if you do the homework, you will be totally fine in the class. The tests are super easy and he grades leniently.","He doesn't explain what he's doing, he just writes things and you are supposed to decipher his terrible hand writing and then figure out what he is even talking about. You NEED the book to understand anything. He's pretty lenient with grading, but that's about it.","He never explains what he's doing. He just writes numbers on the board, adds them incorrectly, then tells some story about his daughters that's completely irrelevant. He barely references the book, but if you want to learn at all you will need the book. Because his lectures accomplish nothing.","Great profoessor, helpful office hrs, you don't even have to buy a text book, exams are concentrated on daily quizes.","Terrible lectures, hardly ever stays on topic. Go to lectures if you want to hear him tell you a story, otherwise spend the time studying and doing the homework he assigns, which will help A LOT more.","Really nice guy, lectures were hard to follow, most of my learning was from using the book. But he is a really nice/funny guy tells funny stories in lecture","He is a funny and nice guy. But do not mistake him for a teacher. You will not learn anything by attending his lectures, but you will hear some good stories.",he was my favorite teacher at u of i.  very helpful and lectures were very fun and easy going.,"He's very funny. But for people who take a ""real"" math class for the first time, it might be difficult. But he always tells interesting stories, his lectures are fun. Tests pretty straight forward. Do the homework even if takes a lot of time, it is definitely worth it."

Homework due every week,  2 exams (Mid-term/Final), she gives you the opportunity to earn extra credit by writing a 5 page paper on a topic that was covered in class. I thoroughly enjoyed her class.","Professor Rosenblatt is extremely knowledgeable. She is a great professor, although she is not the most engaging. Slackers and disinterested students tend to dislike the class, but I felt that grading was fair.","I had this professor 15 to 17 years ago.  She is a genious.  She likes to be treated like a human being.  If you treat her snooty and do not take advantage of her knowledge, that's your problem!","She has got to be the most boring professor I have ever had. She sits down in her chair (because she is physically disabled) and simply reads the powerpoint slides. Literally, she says ""uhmm"" every other sentence, no lie! DO NOT take 274 with her, take it in the Spring with the other professor.","Really,  shes not that bad. The class may be a bit boring, but as long as you complete the weekly assignments there shouldnt be a problem. The midterm and final arent easy, but if you study her notes and weekly assignments, you'll do fine. Some people complain because it is a bit harder than other CHLH classes, but its easy overall.","Do NOT TAKE THIS CLASS WITH HER! she is the worst teacher I've ever had. She teaches the class like an advanced senior class. She goes off on tangents, she grades the hw way too hard and it doesn't matter how hard you study for the tests bc everyone does bad!

It's not the most informative, especially if you already know a bit about documentaries, but the film choices were really interesting. And the small class atmosphere can't be beaten. Take it!!",Will never take again.,"He was a really interesting professor. He knows a lot about what he's talking about and if you go to class, the final will be easy. There are some reading assignments, but those are fairly straightforward. He chose some documentaries that I found really fun to watch! Only two five page essays and one final! He expects participation!",Gives off a cool dad vibe. Really knew what he was talking. The class was interesting but a tad repetitive. Only one exam and two 6-page papers. Class is long but you watch documentaries for about half of it. We got out early almost every week. Gave good feedback on papers. Really chill class with a positive environment.,"Very biased professor. Constantly deviates from the materiallecture to criticize something political, and goes on a ridiculous rant about politics. It is easy to deduce that he is a hardcore liberal. Easy professor, though.","We had weekly quizzes on the reading. overall it was not a complete blow off, but better than most J199 classes","JOUR 199 - The Television Documentary. This was probably the easiest class I could have taken this semester. We met once weekly. Two papers, in-class quizzes, and participation/attendance make up your grade completely.

It is really a free A, test gives partial credit for wrong answers. The papers you turn in arnt really read as far as I can tell, I just turned in some BS. You'll get an A if you show up.",Bruce was hands down one of my favorite professors so far. He is so passionate about Aristotle and other things that we talked about. His lectures are so interesting and you always leave wanting more!,"The class itself is a drag, sometimes it actually becomes interesting. The course is very lecture heavy and class attendance is mandatory. You will only need to get credit for 8 short essays and pass two exams. The essay and exams are easy nothing tough. Although the class is dull, he does the best to make it engaging. Cool professor, boring class.",Have to write these short essays and must receive 8 100's in order to pass this class! I keep getting zeros and literally work on these for hours!,If you are ok with sitting in the room listening to 80 minutes of random and boring lecture then take this class. Supposed to be really easy. But the lecture is just way too boring.  Attendance is required which means you have to be there. 8 short online essays. 2 midterm and 1 final which are supposed to be easy.,"Overall, an extremely easy class. There are 8 short papers assigned, and 2 easy exams. Even on the exams, wrong answers give you partial credit. So, this is basically a GPA booster. However, attendance is absolutely mandatory.  However, Bruce is nice, but rambles on and on during his lectures, and leaves his students confused and very bored.","Rosenstock knows his material. He is by far one of the most interesting professors I've had, and gets you exposure to literature that ought to be mandatory reading for anyone living in the West--The Republic, Leviathan, Hume, etc. If you want to understand the roots of your beliefs, this class will get you close. Do not miss this gem of a class!","Complete joke class. If you show up, you'll get an A. Only 2 exams with 20ish MC questions that he gives to you prior to the exam and then tells you the answers! Seriously, who does that? I'm getting an A but I couldn't tell you what the content of the course was. If you want an A take this class. If you want to learn something, take something else",Class is easy but so boring! You could find a class just as easy that isn't as boring for sure.  It is painful to be in class and he just talks about random stuff that is so obscure. For example right now he is talking about a dog barking when food is falling from the sky... Also takes 2 percent off your grade every time you don't come to class,"Easy class, BORING class. He takes points for attendance which blows because it's impossible to actually listen to him go on huge tangents for two hours about Aristotle. Show up, play on your laptop, do your 8 required questions throughout the semester and you'll be fine. Gives you exam questions before the exam.",Best class ever! I have never had a class that was so easy which was great cuz this was a hard year. Rosenstock does require you to go to lecture which kinda sucks but you can do other things and he is HILLARIOUS when he lecture. gives you questions to the onlt two exams and partial credit. Great guy,"great class. take it if you like philosophy/religion. lecture ranges from boring to interesting depending on what ol dave has planned. but bring your laptop and do other stuff in case you get bored. hw is easy, tests(midterm and final) are 15 mc questions, partial cred given for wrong answers. really nice guy.","If you have any interest in philosophy/religion/growth of society, this class is the best class you can take on campus. it's easy to listen to, you learn a lot, and it's SO EASY. put forth remotely decent effort and you'll ace it, i promise you. ROSENSTOCK IS THE MAN",Extremely easy class. Attendance is mandatory but there are only two MC exams (and he gives you the questions before hand) plus partial credit for wrong answers.  I got 80's on both midterms and a 96 in the class because you only need to do 7 paragraphs for homework throughout the semester and every extra one is 0.5% added to your grade! SO EASY.,"Pretty easy class, attendance IS mandatory. Class is not too exciting (although the professor seems to get really into it). Basically there are two assignments due each week, you need to do 7 the entire semester and it's worth 56% of your grade making it pretty easy. The midterm is multiple choice, with some credit given for wrong answers.",Best teacher I've had at U of  I.  Makes class fun.  I was actually disappointed when i had to miss.  (If you like your professor to sing to you) Take Intensive Biblical Hebrew!! :),"Class is really easy and also really boring.

The exams are pretty tough, but there is a HUGE curve. In the last exam, a C was curved to an A. This is a hard class, but the material is really interesting!","I guess I'm in the minority who thought he wasn't that difficult. Maybe it's more difficult if your not a psych major, but I found if you go over the practice exams before the real exam it's not too bad (and however lazy you think you are, I promise I do less work).","good man, let me take a makeup exam because i came in late after people had already finished the test, lectures are interesting, funny, good examples, test are challenging but curved. i enjoyed the class.","Personally, I think he's a really good teacher.

However, he was so sweet when you do what he asks of you (Come to class on time, bring your materials, ect.) &amp; he truly does want to see his students grow! Lots of open studios to to get some one on one assistance. CHECK OUT HIS WEBSITE! Absolutely take his class if you can!",Super nice but expects you to work hard. Really focuses on the conceptual nature of your work and the techniques you use to further your concept. Had 4 projects and crits. Mostly independent working time.,"Freaking nice! Just show that you are working hard and he won't give you a bad grade. this is not a hard class. Just work hard...or just make sure you show him that.....AND if he doesn't remember your name, it is nothing personal. He eventually will get it. :)","Really funny, cool guy. About a project per week (not afraid to give homework, that man), but he gives interesting projects which are varied and designed to improve your drawing skills. Grades with equal weight on effort, concept, and technical. (Definitely check out his website to see his work!)","He means well, he has a boring voice but a good sense of humor.  It hard to figure out what he likes in art.","I don't even know where to begin when it comes to Joel.  I think about him day and night, and I would love nothing more than to break up he and his wife...not really, he is an adorable father.  Um, he's a good professor, too.  Fun to talk to...he really is a mix of Ben Stein, Harrison Ford and Simon Cowell.  If you can take a class with Joel-do it.","Joel is an amazing profesor. I came into drawing class knowing nothing about drawing and left being able to draw! His sense of humour is extremely dry, and his monotone voice may bore you at first, but by the end of the semester you will love him. Biggest mystery about Joel: where that tattoo ends.",Joel is the most sarcastic hard to read mixture of ben stien and harrison ford you'll ever meet. He always made me laugh and my skills are much better.,No Comments,"This class is my favorite!  Joel is hysterical, and the class is a lot of fun.  I feel my drawing skills have improved drastically, along with my critiquing skills."

But in the end Ross does give a pretty decent curve which helped a lot.,his class never made sense and his TAs r too bad to teach this class. just read the book and do the HW.,he's classes were so boring and didn't make any sense...just do the homework and make sure you understand it,"he's a nice guy but lectures were boooring especially if he was using the overhead. lectures werent very helpful and the TA's sucked too. basically you just have to teach yourself and read the chapters.

1461507,3.0,Grigore,Rosu,5,0.3529622923204251,An OK professor. He is definitely not an expert in this field. Lecture is slow but understandable. The course content is outdated and superficial. A lot of people never went to lecture but got a reasonable grade. Useful for freshmen in introducing the industry and very boring if you are experienced.,"Reasonable lecturer, fair class structure. General knowledge of slides and 'readings' were really all we needed to know. Go to class for pop quizzes as needed (they're basic and graded easily). The course itself is terrible and boring but that was somewhat beyond Rosu's control. Instructing this class is probably not the best use of his talents.","This is a case of where the professor really means well and wants to help, but it takes a long time to understand the lectures. The examples are there, but will often need to be ""decoded"" to get something useful out of them.","Poor lecturing skills. Reads straight off the slides (which are terrible, but he inherited them so that's not his fault.) Difficult to understand in lectures due to mumbling. Exam study guides only tangentially relate to the material that appeared on the exams. Start the MPs early and work in groups!",Professor Rosu did a great job teaching CS 421 this semester.

Oh and he has a wicked sense of humor.",His handwriting is almost impossible to understand. Only way of understanding the content is to listen to his monotonous voice and doing some research online. Avoid him if you can.,"Old fashioned. Illegible handwriting. Take good notes but his textbook is more useful for exams. You have to really know the material but if you do, you can get an A. Attendance is very important. Use the practice exams on compass.","Tough class, no doubt but you won't find someone on campus who can teach the class as well as he can. He's old-fashioned but ended up being my favorite prof over the years because of how clear and no-nonsense he was. He says notes are important but I thought book helped more. If you actually WANT to learn about biz law, this is your guy.","Go to class. Listen. Take notes.  Study.  You will do alright. He is completely useless when it comes to asking for help, but he is very clear in his lectures.  They are very boring but just pay attention and the material is not very hard.  Tests are somewhat difficult because he doesnt give much info as to how the questions will be presented.","I went to his office hours with questions twice and received no help (I was there with an hour to spare and no one else in line). I have been a straight A student since 5th grade without much studying. In this class, I studied for hours upon hours and only managed a 91% which seems good, but that was after a 9.1% total curve (including attendance.)",Cannot read his handwriting on the board.  Must attend every lecture in order to do well on the tests.  Definitely read the book almost word for word for his lectures.  He is not willing to help students whatsoever always refers you to the TAs.,"This class really isn't that bad if you study hard before all of the tests.  There is no homework, and he gives 6.6% extra credit just for going to every class.  Also, he curved our course 2.5%.  Go to the exam review sessions, never miss a class, pay attention, and take outstanding notes.","This is not an easy class by any means. Prof Roszkowski lectures the entire time and does not allow any questions during lecture. His handwriting is atrocious to say the least, so you need to pay attention. Reading the textbook is a must to do well on his tests. Definitely a difficult class, but an A is achievable.","Rosz is a hard prof, no doubt, but his lectures are incredibly clear and well presented. If you go to class, PAY ATTENTION, and read the book, you'll do fine. Personally I loved this class because I learned so much and really understood the material. Plus he has a hilarious sense of humor if you can pick up on it.",Very serious. Lectures the entire time. Has possibly the worst handwriting I've ever seen. Need to read very boring book in order to do well.,"One of the roughest courses I've taken. I never tried so hard to get an A in my life and I still ended up with an A-.  Course lecture is dry, though he does have some occasional humor. Handwriting is illegible so take good notes. You need to know your stuff down pat for the exams. He has extra credit for attendance which helps. Good luck","The professor speaks the whole time, but the material is interesting (enough) to keep your attention for the entire class. If you sit towards the front and the center (to hear him clearly), you are pretty much set for class. Just remember to bring your notebook! I highly recommend you buy his notes book at the bookstore as well as the textbook. &gt;=D",all notes might as well not look at the board you can't read anything...and his test are lets just say i studied 2 weeks before and still got a C in the class and on every exam,"Roszkowski is the guy of guy whose class you'll like because you respect him. He has a dry sense of humor, and he doesn't smile much, but he explains everything you need to know. If you pay attention to him, you'll find his class interesting and he'll grow on you.",Very demanding teacher although you learn a lot about law.  His tests are difficult but there is a lot of extra credit in the class to make up for the difference.,"Biggest Jackass teacher at this school. He yells and makes stern remarks ""99.9999%"" of the time. He doesn't answer questions and makes it considerably harder than it should be. Also, his handwriting is literally illegible, It's as if he learn it by writing symbols on a cave wall. Avoid at all costs.",Knows his stuff and a very efficient lecturer.  Never miss class and take/get good notes.,"Go to class for easy extra credit and read the book for more examples. The exams are over exactly what he lectures over. Make sure you know everything front and back and you'll be okay. Don't underestimate the class though because it does require a good amount of studying. No other work otherthan the 3 exams though. Personally, he's rude+intense.",Easiest class ever! Exams are a piece of cake. Don't even have to study or show up to class! Professor is very easygoing. TAKE THIS CLASS

Also, effort will always be rewarded, so don't fret.","I was going into this class expecting it to be great, and it wasn't.  This class honestly just makes no sense it, he is all over the place when he lectures, what he lectures on does not relate to the papers, or the readings.

Material isn't the most interesting, but he tries to get the class involved.","Materials covered in class are pretty much boring but he tries to make students understand what we learn.

You don't need the books. One 10-12pg paper due at the end of the semester.",An easy enough class with not a lot of requirements.,"EASY CLASS IF YOU HAVE GREAT MEMORIZATION SKILLS. YOU NEVER NEED TO ATTEND CLASS, JUST USE THE STUDY GUIDE HE GIVES BEFORE THE TEST. ITS THE SAME INFO ON THE EXAM. DO NOT READ THE BOOKS.

RUDOLPHS A REALLY COOL GUY, BUT CLASS CAN GET A LITTLE DRY","Like others said, tests are just about memorization.  It's a lot fo information that is covered in the tests.  There are 2, and then a paper (10-12 pages) and a final.  Not the most difficult class, but not the easiest.",Interesting class. Cares about his students.,"don't bother buying the books, exams are based on lecture powepoints which are on compass. If you do the study guides and memorize what's on them, you'll get an A on the exams and never have to attend lecture. Monotonous at times, but not bad. Interesting material.",Very nice guy and is willing to help students who need it.,"Nice guy but very dry and monotonous.  Recaps readings verbatim in lecture, tests are mindless regurgitation, doesn't hand them back.  Completely devoid of comprehension or application, grade is based purely on how much you're willing to memorize.","Tests are pure regurgitation and he doesn't hand them back.  Nice guy but unenthusiastic and very dry, making 1hr.20min. classes seem like an eternity","Very Interesting Class... He basically summarizes readings in lectures, I never read anything and got an A in the class. Very nice professor, helpful",No Comments,Super boring.

Her lecture notes reflected the exam questions fairly, and she did a great job pulling in outside articles to expand on the main concepts. She is clearly an expert in her field and fielded questions from the class very well. Useful content all around.","Lectures were pretty detailed and I appreciated how she added in research studies related to topics, but they were usually her own studies. Reading isn't necessary, the slides are usually detailed enough that you can just go over those and do well on the exam. Offers extra credit in lecture, so I would go as much as possible","It isn't a terrible class, a little dull and she does over explain the simple concepts making it seem she wants to kill time. we usually end early if there aren't any questions posed by students. Tests are usually 50 multiple choice and there are 4 throughout the semester.",I thought this class would be very interesting but I was wrong so boring I almost never went. Only showed up on test days. I wouldn't recommend this course but if you do take it make sure to go to class every day. Random assignments/quizzes in class. Exams pretty tough. Book is life saver.

Easy Gen Ed. and decent teacher.","Loved her! Very friendly teacher, always smiling.Her fashion choices are sometimes questionable but that's besides the point. Had 5 required papers and a group project but very easy. She lets you revise any paper to get a better grade.","Easy and informative, teacher's a hottie",No Comments,"she was a really nice teach.  I never read the assignments before hand and I think she picked up on that because she rarely asked me for my opinion.  I got A's on 4/5 essays and the other a B, so it was really easy. All in all, she's very easy and pleasent teacher.","Very fun Class. Teacher seems a little flaky at first, but once you get to know her, it gets way better. My friends in rhet 105 classes always told me how they were swamped with work...with Gwen, you have the 5-6 required papers, and thats it.

Learned a lot.,"This class had three vocab quizzes as the ""exams"". One writing assignment due every week based off of the readings. She read through the readings in class.

Her lectures are kinda just reading off her power points, but I think she is very knowledgable.",She has no idea how to teach a class like this.

The lectures and assignments are pointless and do not really correspond to what is on the exams. The TA's are terrible.

Fairly easy teacher and very engaging.,"Professor Rukgaber is an excellent professor for several reasons. He is an extremely talented thinker, and he is able to convey his knowledge succinctly to students. He is available to help if you fall behind in the course and his grading procedures are fair. He is not the most prompt with his grading, but the grading is well thought out and fair.","Matt is a really nice guy, and from what I understand he hasn't been a professor for very long. He does an OK job, though. A bit unorganized, a very loose ship. Had a reasonable time learning ethics though, and he was very helpful when you needed help with papers, lecture, or anything.","This professor is a complete embarrassment to the university.  His lectures are dull and he takes attendance, probably since no one would show up if he did not.  He feels that anyone who does not believe what he does is a ""skeptic"" and is not shy about saying they're misguided.  To the Dean: Please remove this professor from the university.","Takes forever to grade.  Is not consistent with grading.  Expects you to understand things on the same level as him (even though intro class).  I took it with the understanding that we would be writing papers.  Instead he gave exams with MC, short answer, and essay.  This can be hard when it comes to a subject like this.  Take another prof if poss."

You just have to go as an attendance sheet is passed around.,"Great Professor. I am a sophomore at the University, and not going to lie, it was challenging. Glad I took the class. Learned plenty and that's because he lectures were interesting.","This is the second class I've taken with Rumsey. Lectures are conducted in seminar style, and she cold-calls on students, so be prepared to discuss the material. If you say something controversial or ignorant, be prepared to engage in an academic discussion with her (note: these showdowns are fun to watch). One 10 page paper due during finals.","Soooooooo much reading- that I didn't do. But it will help you on exams and in class  discussions.   Asian TA  guy is a TOUGH grader on exams. Marks things as ""inadequate"" without an explanation. Teacher is very knowledgeable, as been said. Kinda feel like she makes the class harder than necessary. VERY STINGY with help regarding exams.","Very knowledgeable. You must read or she will know and it won't be pretty. All that said, I did not learn a thing. Maybe it was too easy, which is a shame because I so wanted to learn. She commands respect and was great.","Firstly, she's so cute. Secondly, she's extremely knowledgable in her field, cares a lot about teaching, and makes her lectures interesting.

He's more about getting rid of words and focused on critical thinking. The assignment was something like ""identify a moment that changed your life."" Well, I'd checked all of my luggage for a flight from A","Wouldn't have chosen any other professor for RHET 105. Gives helpful feedback and is a fair grader. I really like that he due dates for papers were fair. Also, he hosts office hours every week which is helpful.",I would not recommend this professor if you want an A or an A+. He is a strict grader and is too unrealistic with the goals he asks from freshman students. His prompts are so complex to the point of confusion. He talks a lot (which I don't mind) but most of the time it is unrelated to the actual writing and learning process.,Top 2 or 3 classes I ever took.,Steve was very helpful to help me understand how to make my essays better when I went to office hours. He's a very helpful professor and a nice person.,"I was recommended this professor by my roommate who had him last year and said he was really nice and the class focused on technology. It wasn't what I expected but he is very helpful and I think my writing is better. He makes a lot of comments on your papers, which i liked.","Great teacher. Sometimes overexplains things and gets a little lost in tangents, but it's part of his personality, which is really cool and easy-going. I liked how much he seemed to believe in what he was teaching. Made me think about big ideas. Felt a little lost sometimes but talked to him after class and it made sense. One of my best classes.","Steve is a great guy, but more of a philosophy teacher. He takes a holistic approach to all papers, meaning there is no ""taking sides"" in any paper, whether is be analytical, research based, or story. Be prepared to question a lot of things and write a bunch (10) of small 1 page papers in addition to 4 big assignments. There's a group project too.","Steve is a lecturer who's passionate about what he's teaching. He also always has office hours every week, so you can look for help. However, there is no clear grading criteria, which makes it very difficult to really know what he looks for in the essays. There are also no extra credit whatsoever, so that makes your final paper worth a lot.","Steve is a great professor, not only for his interesting lectures (always prepared with questions, explanations and reflections), but also for his helpfulness. He makes himself available to discuss the assignments (only three papers and small projects) I would highly recommend to take RHET 105 with him","Awesome teacher. Only 3 papers and a group project. Participation matters a lot towards the beginning, but he's not uptight about it. He's always understanding and makes himself available a lot. Makes you work for your grade, but he's a fair grader. Steve's the MAN!","Professor Runkle is one of the best teachers I have known. Sometimes it's a little hard to know what he wants your essay to be like, but just talk to him and he will explain. It seems like maybe that's the point. The whole class seems like it's about figuring things out. Most of his assignments make you try to figure out what something means .","Steve is a great lecturer who genuinely cares about his students. He makes you really wrap your head around the essay topics, but it is less work compared to the assignment other rhetoric teachers make their students. He is always there for his students and a great guy in general.","Easily one of the best professors I have ever had. Mr. Runkle is so caring about his students, and deeply wants them to succeed. He gives terrific feedback on in class essays. Take his feedback seriously, and you will do well. I could not recommend him any higher.","I say now to all the world that this man, this teacher who names himself as ""Stephen"" Runkle on the course syllabus but who goes by ""Steve"", and whose name may or may not really be either, I say now before the assembled world that this man does indeed believe that he is cool. But that's okay, because he is, indeed, quite right.","Steve is a righteous dude. And if you've ever ridden through Pittsburgh on Amtrak at night &amp; seen the bridges spanning the city's trio of rivers like necklaces of light, then you know what it's like to be pleased by a thing. Steve's class pleased me. It's not your average potato salad-type affair of busy work punctuating spells of boredom.",Runkle is the man.,"One of the best things about Steve's class is we had it indoors. It can be very cold or hot or sometimes even windy and indoors was a tremendous choice. Plus his volume as appropriate most of the time. Sometimes something like a radiator is banging in a class, which can be really annoying. If the class is at lunch time, be sure to eat before it!",Do you think maybe cheeseburger is the answer? I think fun but it wasnt fun all the time. Class begins and everyone is sitting. A camper with all the latest apps and attachments was wheeled out like a prize from Price is Right. Now whom do you think is your daddy? This was not an appropriate way to celebrate anything. Even the fish was bad. Very.,Mr. Runkle brought a lot of energy and interest into a class that I expected to suck. He's one of the best teachers I've ever had. He actually seemed to care about what he's doing.

The exams are tricky for the most of the part.,Pop quizzes without any announcement before hand so every one have no idea about what will be on it. Most of the time every one did horribly on it. The textbooks and readings are not necessary to read. You can study on your own on days which have no quizzes. Boring and confusing class after all.,His class is might too hard in terms of a non western general education class. The quizzes he gave make students feel no clews.

Not recomend his class as a good General Education, take some other classes. Tas' not  helpful.",Never trust anything you see about comments on this professor. This class is extreme hard for a Gen Ed. The exams and quizzes are hard and very tricky. Memorization cannot guarantee you do well. Paper grades by TAs are totally not genuine. The class is not organized. Intructios are entirely vague. The class is very difficult for a Gen Ed.,"There are surprise quizzes in class, but he covers many aspects of Japanese culture, and the material is not difficult to understand.  Most of what is on quizzes and exams is stressed during lecture.  Just show up and read lecture notes and you'll learn and do well in the class.","Although I got an A for this class, it was not a super easy class as described here. Grading of paper was not that generous, and quizzes were somewhat tricky. You have to memorize all the details in order to succeed in this course.",Great professor with a great personality! Loves to get personal with his stories and experiences! Reading load is manageable attendance to lectures are fun because of weekly films. Great class.,"Easy A if you are good with memorization. Lots of readings but not necessary. Must attend class due to amount of pop quizzes. For finals, memorize the lecture notes and you will do fine. I memorized the lecture notes for both midterm and final and got an A+ on both, without reading the required texts.",Teaches EALC 250. NOT an easy class.. it seems like he has changed his class to make it more difficult. Lots of reading and difficult material to understand. Attendance is basically mandatory because of all the pop quizzes. The prof is fun and quirky but I would not recommend this class if you are looking for something easy.,"This is not an ""easy A."" It's not an easy A. If you take this course be ready to do lots and lots of readings. Although attendance its not mandatory, be there because you can miss pop quizzes. It's not hard by any means too, but not an easy A.","An easy A, but not quite a gimme.  You don't have to do the readings, but make sure you know the notes. I found the course very interesting, which is why I went nearly everyday, but he provides the notes so if you miss a day here and there, it's no big deal.

198914,4.3,David,Ruzic,24,0.5824585134712261,"I don't have a strong math or science background but I didn't struggle in that aspect. Professor Ruzic is a genius and loves what he teaches but he doesn't care much about students. All office hours and grading done by undergraduate TA's - little access to professor. Learned a ton, worked my butt off and still got A-. Must go to class.","I was in the honors section, which in addition to the regular class, would meet weekly to discuss topics more in depth (really good discussions).  Homework was very reasonable.  Explosions every class and his enthusiasm for the topics made for an engaging class. He also hosted a barbecue and bonfire at the end of semester which was fun",Unless you like the smell of burning coal and or fire crackers I would not suggest this class. Homeworks are long and seem fairly irrelevant to course work. Tons of writing for an engineering course. Midterms are all written short answer questions. If you are a science or math person know that this class will not cater to you.,"I took the class because I needed to fulfill QR2. Having NO background in chemistry or physics, I was reassured by the course description that no prior knowledge in these subjects was assumed. He DOES assume quite a bit of prior knowledge, however, and it was too much for me. It was fun though, and he's the UIUC Prof. Lockhart. Just be warned!","I would honestly recommend this class to anyone. As a nukie it was decently useful to learn about other energy sources but the math and physics is so basic and minimal that it is 100% doable for literally any major. Ruzic is a great lecturer, it's actually a class that I wanted to show up to instead of having to drag myself there. Take NPRE 101!!","AWESOME guy. His class is very interesting and very fun. He explains everything with great clarity and will answer any question you have.The discovery section he has is also really fun, we always take field trips around campus to get to know the university better. Very friendly guy. The exams are somewhat hard, but very doable.","Very interesting class that's exceptionally relevant to the modern world. His presenations are exciting and engaging. The homework and out of class work is very reasonable. The biggest downside are the exams which are open answer not multiple choice. Also, He loves to blow things up which makes the lectures a blast!",Lots of fun.  Explosions and field trips keep you interested.,"One of the few professors, that is both intelligent in his field as well as a great teacher/lecturer. You MUST go to class for a chance at a good grade but you'll want to go. He gives you the list of questions on the test before the test..He picks 10, know how to answer them all and you got yourself an A. Blows something up almost every class.",Class was fun. We blew something up every day just like he promised. Exams were extremely straightforward.,"This class was a lot harder than I thought it would be.  It required a lot of studying and the concepts were not that easy.  My friend told me it was an easy A, but it definitely wasn't.  Professor Ruzic is smart, but sometimes it's really, really hard to follow what he's saying in lecture.","Like the other ppl said, He is a really good lecturer, but don't expect an easy A unless you're a fan of math/science! This class is great for getting your QII/Science requirements, but its is pretty hard for someone who doesn't really enjoy math/science!","He is pretty clear and helpful, and overall the class if fairly easy. He also makes the class interesting. However, he makes it sound like nuclear energy is amazing and that there's nothing wrong with it, even though there is. At the same time, he makes alternative energy look like it can't help us very much. Look at his department: he is biased!",Absolutely amazing.  A class that I actually looked forward to going to.  He is such a dynamic speaker and can make any topic interesting.  The tests are based heavily on the lectures.,Best professor ever.  Knows pretty much everything.  Great class! Blows up a lot of stuff.,"TAKE THIS COURSE!!! Not only does he blow stuff up, you actually learn stuff that you can user in life. Everyone should take this course. Everything is reasonable.","If you are even considering this course, TAKE IT. This guy is a great professor and always keeps the topic very interesting. The class is relatively easy, but you will learn a LOT about energy sources. One of the best courses I have ever taken.","An absolutely great professor. I love the class - and yes, it's great that there's always some sort of demonstration(usually an explosion). After you take the class, you can decide for yourself if you agree with me in saying he looks a bit like MacGyver - no disrespect intended - MacGyver is awesome",Blows up something every class.  How can one go wrong?,I love this man.  Could he be a better teacher?  Anyone who blows up several things and lights even more things on fire on the first day has got to be amazing!

She's also very helpful as she went above and beyond to help me create a marketing plan for my Summer internship. I really enjoy being in her class!","I was looking forward to learn a lot in this class (PComm - Professional Communication), unfortunately the lecturer is as bad as it gets.  The class is very boring and you do not learn much if anything.  It is a shame she is was in charge of such an important topic."
757260,3.9,Eman,Saadah,9,0.5145114687512533,"Eman Saadah was the worst professor I've had at UIUC. She was very harsh with the non-Arab students in her class, often criticizing them in a way that is not conducive to learning or effective teaching.","Too much busy work. Class structure and criteria is messy, note taking structure very unclear, and assignments were too general. Class isn't horrible but it's unorganized which makes me anxious. I dropped it.","can seem intimidating at first, but is super flexible with students and does everything she can to do well. A lot of homework in this class, but she is chill about due dates. participation is important!",Best professor on campus by far!! She makes everything crystal clear and is there for the students!! If all the teachers taught like her then we would all be in good hands,"good professor who knows the Arab world very well. She is open-minded and funny at times. The class is not that bad; there are pre class readings, discussions, a couple papers, and one presentation by every student. The work was a bit more than I expected, but I learned a lot from this class.","Awesome teacher. She is very helpful when it comes to cultural confusion, and the readings she puts up are fair and quite interesting.","Although she seems very strict and slightly intimidating, she is extremely helpful. If you show genuine interest in the class and ask her for help, she will do everything she can for you.","Eman is very knowledgeable, explains the material well, and is very invested in helping her students succeed.",Helpful. Shows genuine interest in students succeeding. Not as hard as other reviews would lead you to believe.

AVOID her if possible. Her final exam is very difficult compared to her midterm exams.,"As a professor shes ok at best. Her lectures were just ok mainly because she's one of those math teachers that spends half the time doing proofs not realizing that proofs are pointless for non math majors aka 98% of the class. Her exams were hard, but there was a curve",Do not take her class.  The best part of the class was when she had to leave because of having no work permit.  I went to her office hours once to ask questions about a test and instead of helping me she pointed out that according to her I should have gotten a worse grade. Plus she only went over theory that had nothing to do with the material.,"AVOID AVOID AVOID!  As a teacher she is ok at best, her tests are on the hardest material and they screw you over.  Not only does she not curve anything, but she makes the grading scale HARDER, at least for my class.  Because of that I almost had retake the class because my 72.5% wasn't a C-.  Thank god for advisers and prerequisite overrides","Really bad teacher, quite unhelpful. I tried going to office hours twice, only to find out that she wasn't there and waited around like an idiot for ten minutes with a couple of others in the class before just buggering off and finding myself a tutor for the rest of the semester. When I asked her in class why she wasn't there she was incredibly rud","It's really a shame she left halfway through the semester. The tests were very difficult, but if you understood the material well, you would get an A. She was more interested in how well you knew your stuff than the stupid mistakes you made. Only complaint was the class average she was shooting for 70 in an honors class you need an 80 to get credit",She is simply awesome. If you wanna enjoy maths go for her class. She gives really easy tests too so you can easily get an A. I enjoyed going to her class and hearing her Russian accent. A must class for anyone interested in maths.,"Her teaching is rather bland, but it gets the job done. Don't expect to much enthusiasim when she teaches. On the plus side she is willing to explain things after class if you don't understand.",She just goes straight from the book. She always wore the same skirt... She doesn't seem excited at all to be teaching our class. My TA was awesome though. He was really helpful and funny,"Very attractive. Teaches effectively and doesn't appear to care about students, unless you demonstrate that you value your education. If you care, or show so, she goes the extra mile to ensure that you understand the material.",Terrible lecturer. You can tell she would rather be doing research than teaching. I learned everything from my TA. Exams were rather difficult.,"Class is difficult, but that's more due to the actual content of the class.  Very helpful woman that offered a number of office hour opportunities.  Not bad on the eyes either.","This professor was very nice but not the best at explaining the material.  Her notes are taken straight from the book but i would still go to class in order to get a better understanding.  You only have one homework assignment a week, 2 exams, and a final - pretty easy workload, but make sure to study for the exams!!!"
1538762,4.2,Marcin,Sabok,2,0.5748670414670267,Pretty good lectures. Gives homework every week. The exams are fairly simple and come largely from homework problems. Go to class and faithfully do the homework and you'll do well!,"Fairly rigorous course, but the professor is really easy. He is extremely helpful in office hours and trust me, you will need them. Midterms are easy, usually from the course book."
1278286,2.6,Vishal,Sachdev,11,0.4200507216887411,Vishal was an amazing professor. Very easy to talk to and his lectures were always well prepared. He gave me great feedback on my work but it is important to keep up with assignments.,Does not know how to teach. Excessive amount of work. Keeps repeating same thing over and over and does not help students. Take this course with someone else.,"Not an easy grader. Group project is annoying too. Overall not a great lecturer and the tests are pretty difficult. He is really good about meeting with students for office hours, however. Take this class with a different professor if possible.",easy class and cool prof,"Overall, average.  I didn't like the way the class was structured (lots of discussion posts and then critiques of others' posts) and the final project required more skills than the average person without much of a tech background had.  The material was interesting though, so this class would be great with a better professor",Worst professor I've had at UIUC. EXCESSIVE amount of work for literally no reason and he is very boring and monotone. Take a different section at all costs.,"I thought that Professor Sachdev's class was surprisingly interesting and relevant to the real world. He is very knowledgable and funny and is very willing to offer help, as long as you ask for it! His tests do include a lot of memorization, but luckily they aren't worth too much of your grade. I also felt that he always graded homework fairly.","Wish I had checked here before I signed up. Jesus! Stay away from him. Trust me. This is the first time I have ever left negative feedback on any professor. THE WORST ever in all aspects including structure of course, grading, and teaching skills. Very narrow minded as well. Stay away. Probably will get an A, but waste of time.","not an enthusiastic teacher, doesnt hand back the tests at all, very monotone, doesnt seem to like his job, does not announce homework assignments, and just seems like a very depressed person in general. it was a depressing time going to class knowing that nothing even remotely exciting will come out of him during the lecture to help liven up the c","The single most time consuming 3 hour course I've ever had. 5 assignments (varying from 2 pages single spaced to pointless group assignments), a project that included a 9-10 page SINGLE SPACED paper, and 2 tests.   15% of the grade is participation and he talks the entire time, leaving no room for students to participate.","Interesting class w/ a real-world focus. However, he will drive you insane. He doesn't announce the assignments, compass HW is posted 12 hours before it's due, and you don't know what to expect on tests. The tests are memorizing the hundreds of IT words you read - nothing more. I expected more from a 300-level class. He is an easy grader, though."

562551,4.9,Misumi,Sadler,6,0.7197670554611232,"Amazing professor. She is a native Japanese and has deep knowledge of the Japanese language, so you should ask her as many questions during class, office hours, or via email. She also provides amazing feedback on homework and exams.","Awesome person all around. We only saw her once a week or so; TAs taught us most of the week, but when she DID teach us, she was super cool. Always, always willing to help and make herself available to you. I've only spent a semester learning Japanese, but I already feel like I've learned so much.","Sadler-sensei is amazing; she has Beginner and Intermediate Japanese down to an art.  The class is very well structured and emphasizes all the key aspects of the language.  You *will* learn how to speak, read, write, and understand Japanese from taking her classes.  Class is never a bore, and it isn't very difficult compared to other languages.",,"Excellent teacher, very organized, follows syllabus to the T.  Also holds Japanese Language conversation tables outside of class, where students can practice speaking in a casual setting.","Sadler-sensei is awesome.  She knows how to organize a course, she supports her students, and she even sends encouraging emails to students who need them.  A very good person in general.  Very sweet lady."
1092868,3.8,Randall,Sadler,3,0.5971851423263327,"The class is easy if you go and participate. He's very creative in his use of technology, and encourages you to be also. Might not be for some people who want to be more traditional, and you won't always have the chance to use everything he shows you, but it's more the idea of being innovative (but also useful) in how you use technology.","I disagree with the below poster: this class was useless! A vague final paper, Second Life for 17 weeks, a smattering of random websites that supposedly were helpful. Sure, we looked at them, but nothing more. We always went back to that stupid Second Life making a vague project! Teacher is nice though...",Computer Mediated Communication for Language Teaching is a very practical class; I learned a lot about different technologies to use in the classroom (and actually tried using most of them which was the most benefitial aspect of the course.)
1935998,4.3,Noel,Saenz,14,0.6179794903609311,He's the best! The workload of this class is super low and Noel made everything crystal clear. A shame for anyone who received a grade that's lower than an A.,"Very clear in explanations, you can tell he enjoys teaching and is openly available to help.","Saenz is obviously very passionate about the material but his lecturing isn't the best. Sometimes his explanations will become jumbled because he mixes up words, goes on tangents, and trails off without finishing his sentence. It's best to read the book and do LOTS of practice problems (especially if you take a long time to solve proofs, like me).","This class was the class that I could blow off until the exams and then cram in a bunch of knowledge to get an A. A lot of long lectures, I learned more from the youtube Phil 102 professor than him. He talks really fast but if you actually read the chapter and try on your homework you'll do fine, after all- the exam questions are in the txt",His test questions are straight out of the textbook. He is available outside of class if you need help and cares a lot about his students doing well.,"Dr. Saenz is an excellent orator and you can see he's very passionate about philosophy and wants his students to be, too. PHIL 100 is a writing intensive and if you go to office hours the (800w) papers should be easy enough. The quizzes in discussion can be tricky, so do well on them because those and the papers are your only graded assignments.","He is a good teacher and clearly knows his topic well. However I wasn't a fan of the structure of the course. Our entire grade was one long paper broken up into 4 sections that we turned in throughout the semester. But the paper is all on one topic, so there's no reason to studyreally learn the other topics of the course. Wasn't challenging at all",Most of the lectures and discussions don't even show up on the exams but they're great to listen to nonetheless. A great speaker and if you're just a little bit into philosophy he makes it very interesting.,Very cool guy. Very encouraging and loves when students get involved during lecture. Very passionate about what he teaches. Makes learning the material fun.,Favorite professor. Great lecturer and very generous with his time and consideration. Would definitely recommend everyone to take a class with him.,No homework! No paper! yay! Nearly all test questions are from slides posted online. He is really passionate about teaching.,"THE BEST!! He's so nice, helpful, understanding, and cool.  Take him.","His passion for philosophy shows when he lectures. He teaches the class in a very engaging and intriguing manner. If you have the chance to take a class he is teaching, don't miss out on the opportunity!",Noel is very engaged in the subject and he takes time to clear up any questions in lecture. Overall a very good professor.

This class is also really fun, very chill and relaxed. Definitely recommend people take Swedish or any class taught by professor Safstrom!","Even though this class wasn't part of my major, it was the most enjoyable class I took this semester. The lectures were interesting and the professor was very nice and professional. I would recommend this highly for your western comparative  gen ed.",WOW,Nice guy but tough grader!! This class lowered my GPA.,This class is definitely too much work for a gen ed. It was way more work than my other gen ed's combined. He also has a very confusing grading system where he grades papers out of 3 points. I think this class would be ideal if you are a scan major as you learn a lot and he knows his stuff but don't take if you're just looking to fulfill a gen ed.,"Scan 240 was an extremely easy class-easy A+ if you show up, participate and put some effort into papers.  Skimmed most of the reading so the material is very easy but long. Professor Safstrom is super easy at grading and is very passionate about his work. He is also pretty hilarious and kinda charming, would recommend.","Would not recommend taking this class to fulfill a gen. ed. as it's boring unless you're really interested in the Arctic. You have to submit a series of short response papers throughout the semester, which is not bad at all, but the final consists of a 12-page research paper. I did not even have a 12-page paper in my ACP class. Need I say more?","Good professor who is enthusiastic about his field; however, his lectures are not very engaging, and he assigns a ridiculous amount of (mostly tedious) reading. Wouldn't recommend taking this class unless you plan to major in Scandinavian Studies or have an especially keen interest in the Arctic.",Great professor.  Would definitely take a class with Safstrom again,Easy class easy A. TAKE HIM,GREAT TEACHER! He is straight forward and gives a lot of opportunities for the student to pass.,"He is the most amazing, fantabulous professor, and I owe my carreer to his infectuous love of Scandinavian studies",Great professor.

Tests can range from easy to hard, but the lectures slides are helpful. Make sure you use the TA to help with HW, and go to office hours!","Didn't go to lecture since before the first exam. Excel quizzes are rough, tests are extremely hard, but if you study enough you should be fine. I didn't study for the final so I bombed it and ended the class with a 79%. Midterms are curved, final is not, but overall grade is by a couple percentage points. Get Petry or you'll be teaching yourself.","This is a difficult course. She truly cares about her students and wants them to succeed. Make sure that you attend all lectures and discussion sections. Study hard before each test, and make sure to review the practice exams. Studying hard will definitely get you at least a B or B+. Take advantage of office hours and get as much help as you can.","Honestly, she is just not a good teacher. She reads off the slides (which were written by Petry) the whole time, and seems confused herself at times, which makes it hard to learn from her. Homework takes a long time to finish. Study the past exams and ""conceptual questions"" were tested on heavily. If you have a choice take Petry instead.","She is alright, but the structure of this course is bad.  The HW will not help you at all on the tests, so just get the answers from somebody and study using the booklet and the previous exams.  Those are the most important things.  Dont bother with hw.  Take this class with Petry if he has any openings though.","I didn't care for her as a professor. Don't buy the book, never used it once. Do not just do the class problems from the book to study for the test (in fact do them last if you have time). The old exams are the best way to prepare for the tests. Keep up w/ the homework, some will take longer than u think. N go to class!","Class was cake, easiest class ever. My final grade was 98% and I got A+. If you are  Business major, no meed to worry about this course.",Great Professor for Econ 302. She goes through everything very well. Would recommend staying up with the homework and using her in class examples problems to study. Not a hard class if the effort is put in!,She went out of her way to make sure the students were prepared for the exam. Explained clearly and made the class interesting and kept you concentrated.,"Her notes are word for word from the book, and exams are exactly like the problems she does in class. She has a light accent, but is not hard to understand. Overall, she is very fair and a nice lady.","WHOA. She made this course that is supposed to be okay into something difficult. Many students skip the lecture because there is no point; everything is in the notes. She is a good looking teacher, but you will fall asleep because she is boring and incomprehensible. I did not enjoy this course. Don't make the same mistake as I did --take Petry.","In all honesty, she's not a good teacher. She's very difficult to understand and really can't breakdown the material. The class in itself is very difficult. Try to take it with Petry.","She was an okay professor but that class is very hard.  I didn't learn anything at lecture or discussion and it was boring as we just go over powerpoint slides the whole time, which you are given. The online homework is annoying and is completely different from tests.  the only thing helpful is the past tests given to you.",Great prof! Will recommend her course.,"One of the best Econ 302 Professors on campus. I would definately recommend taking her. It is true that she is hard to understand sometimes, but if you get one-on-one help from her, it shouldn't be a problem. Tests are basically from the lectures. Make sure you understand the examples she gives out in class b/c they show up in the test!",She was a great teacher who really cared about her students! Made Econ 302 bearable!,,"Sahakyan was horrible. Impossible to understand, poor at communicating the material, very aloof when trying to communicate one-on-one.","Zaruhi is difficult to understand during lecture. Homeworks are fair, count for 20% of grade. All exam questions are similar to problems gone over in class. Attendance isn't necessary to do well. Missed half the classes and got an A. Attend the review sessions before exams, she goes over almost every problem on the exam.","Go to lecture. It's the best way to learn the material in ECON 203. Sahakyan is pretty good. She has an accent, but it ISN'T heavy. She's really nice &amp; tries to engage students &amp; encourages them to ask questions.

1986977,3.5,Janeen,Salak-Johnson,6,0.5255139824760504,She is honestly my favorite professor at UIUC. She is very smart and she is a very nice person. She has her own opinion but it is an educated opinion and she honestly bases it off of research. I have so much respect for her and she deserves way more credit than what she gets. I will take as many of her classes as I can. Just pay attention.,"She gets a bad rap but really is not that bad.  It helps if you talk to her a little bit and get to know her.  Her opinion does show through in her lectures, but she does not take away points if you disagree with her.",I personally think Dr. Johnson is a great lecturer and teacher. She looks at all sides of the spectrum when discussing contemporary issues. People don't see this probably because the truth isn't what they want to hear. She is clearly passionate about what she does in animal behavior. One of her cons is that her lectures are kind of lengthy.,"Loud, rude, annoying, frustrating.  Doesn't care what you say your opinion is she's set in her ways.  Painful class to attend, but you'll get through it in time.","If you do not agree with her opinions on some contemporary issues, you will absolutely be marked down for it.  She gives a lot of busy work, which can be hard to keep up with at times.  She also comes across as being rude sometimes, especially if you don't agree with her.  Definitely one of the worst ANSC professors on campus.","She assigns TONS of busy work.

Does not move too quickly during lecture to ensure full understanding.,Salapaka is an alright professor but what I really didnt like about him was that he was not careful at all about writing lecture notes. There were always mistakes which made the class even harder to understand. He bases his exams on the hw and class examples so going to office hours really helps clear things up. He also keeps candy in his pockets,"If you know basic calculus stuff like the chain rule, this class will be a breeze and you will learn a ton.

The class schedule was ditched early on, and it seemed like he was improvising the semester as he went. He would make up extra credit assignments on the spot with very short notice. Never answered emails. Not a hard class, but not worthwhile.","Professor Salo is a well-intentioned and smart man, but he is also extremely liberal. This class requires you to write a lot, so make sure to pick a viewpoint that leans left if you want a good grade.","Hes just honestly not a good teacher. Not a hard class to get an A or B in, but he will stress you out with his complete lack of organization, and total lack of clarity. He also will just surprise you and come up with randon assignments and little clarity at all times.","He's an excellent teacher who is very understand with issues in your personal life that may conflict with class. He's always there to make your life easier and is super passionate about what he's teaching in ""Teaching Ferguson."" The assignments are not complicated and you will do well on them if you put effort into it, but it's not hard to do.",You don't have to read every chapter of the book but just your chapter you're going to present on and show up to class and listen you'll pass flying colors.,"I only really read chapters when we had presentations on them or when we had writing assignments coming up. Expect lots of those. In order to make the course load less immediately intensive he has multiple 500 or 250 word assignments and one final 2,500 word assignment. Lectures are mandatory only because you hear his thoughts on various topics.","Defining what was required for a good grade was extremely difficult, he is constantly modifying the syllabus: adding assignments, removing some, changing others. Talking to him and emailing him for clarification will not help as I've done both and each time his response has been different. Extensive writing, relatively harsh grader, presentations.","Prof. Salo really knows his stuff, he makes you think critically and broaden your views. Class can get kind of awkward and quiet if people don't participate, as he relies heavily on discussion. Prepare for A LOT of writing. For my class it was 5 papers plus 1 longer final paper, but most of the essays build on each other and are repetitive.","Professor Salo's class may lack some structure at times, but it is far from horrible. Salo is an extremely intelligent teacher that truly wants his students to look at the world's events critically. The class consists solely of writing assignments which aren't too hard if you put some effort into them. Also, Salo is always willing to help.","Salo's long winded musings have little basis in reality. he gives vague and confusing instructions for assignments and will change the goals half way to deadline. be ready for saturday morning walking-tours and 3,000 word essays. take this class if you are willing to walk all over the city and write endlessly."

She encourages her students to memorize everything, when she can't memorize her own material.","Instructor easy to approach, explained material well, provided lots of examples to illustrate points","This class is straightforward (&amp; easy if you put in the work) but attendance is absolutely necessary. Ida always made the information interesting &amp; took time to have class discussions rather than just lecture which made the content easier to recall for me.

Can get an A if you read the book.,Committed to students and always willing to make time to give feedback.,She sometimes confuses material but the readings are easy. Not a bad class but you need to learn the material on your own.,She is honestly the worst teacher I've had here in my 3 years. It's so hard to pay attention to her and she doesn't know what she is talking about. she had to look up the answer to someone's question on google during lecture. i asked her if something specific would be on the exam and she said no and then there were 2 questions on it. avoid her.,"Very difficult to follow during lectures. She often makes mistakes and confuses information during lecture. Fortunately the material in abnormal psych is relatively easy. She's nice, and she seems to try, but overall I'd avoid her if you can.",Her lectures are boring and the material is not too bad but I feel like it is hard to pay attention to her and the readings are dense so you do not get the material easily. She does not really know what she is talking about half the time. She keeps saying on thing and then the other. She is nice though.,"So scatterbrained. The material is easy enough but she scrambles it - giving multiple correct answers on review days &amp; not remembering which is the one that will be right for the tests. The writing prompts and research are super easy though. She seems too busy with other projects to handle teaching well. Not bad, but she really needs to up her game"

His lectures, while understandable, can be tough to follow well (because of his deep expertise with the material) and his exams can be challenging. Homework is medium difficulty. Great textbook choice!","Explains the material well, exams are tough. They're do-able, but it's a lot of work to do in the time allotted. He makes the material interesting, which is hard to come by in the math department","Admittedly his lectures are a little bit boring. However he explains concepts very clearly and gives enough examples in class. The class (Differential Equation) is a hard one, indeed. But that's not the fault of the instructor.","Just  copies the example problems from the textbook, but with an accent that is difficult to understand.  I failed the first (easiest) midterm trying to understand his lectures and got a B+ on the second after I stopped going to lecture. Just read the book and self-teach, no point in going to lecture",Some parts of his lecture material isn't clear. There is still confusion with the information after its been given out.,He is very unclear in his teaching and cannot answer any questions by his students.

Would strongly recommend this course if you need some GenED credits.",She did her best to make the lectures interesting. More reading heavy class.,"Super funny person and a great class. A professor we are lucky to have, makes everything clear, actually cares! Her work is cool too ask her about it. made me want to be a sociology major","A big part of the class is a semester-long research paper written in parts (20-30 pages total). She was very flexible on due dates and her criteria for assignments was really clear. If you do not understand something, she has no problem dedicating class time to explaining. Don't take this class with another professor. Not an easy A, but doable!","Dr. Sandefur manages to be laid back while also still seeming professional and incredibly knowledgeable. The class is basically just discussions on readings, so make sure you read them well. She prettymuch tells you exactly what is going to be on the exams (2/3 of the exams are online) so as long as you show up, read, and take notes you'll be fine.","This class w/ Sandefur was a BREEZE! There were 3 tests, 2 online and one in class. There was a group project in 3 installments where you do 3 easy presentations.  Attendance was random, so show up! You're only allowed 2 absences. There are also flipped classes where you do not have to attend class and instead do an assignment. Take this class!!","She is entertaining, slideshows include many video and she interacts with students, I found that this helped me pay attention. If you don't like reading this might not be the class for you, even though many of my friends didn't read and still passed with a B-. Overall straightforward class.","Dr. Sandefur was great!

Sandefur is funny and makes lectures interesting even though the content can be boring. Good, easy gen ed!","Sandefur is an amazing professor! Lectures have iclicker points so attendance is kind of mandatory. Posts slides on moodle. Lots of extra credit.

You learn a lot! Fun class.",Every student should take her SOC 100 class. You certainly learn a lot about the workings of the society. She is a wonderful teacher.,"The best. Loved soc 100, and she is funny in lecture. Discussion sections are really helpful, but most everything is handed to you. Dope class.",Attendance is needed only because she sometimes gives out status checks that count toward grade. Never read the books and wasn't a big problem.,"Great class overall, great way to fulfill the gen eds. Tests aren't hard but reading the books and going to lecture definitely make them easier.  Only 3 tests and 2-3 mini projects a semester, plus readings that you only need to skim.

She really makes class interesting, even though most of the content is mostly basic knowledge. This class does have a lot of reading, but it's not too boring. Only a few short assignments for the semester and she offers lots of extra credit.

He has a great sense of humor and is really great at critiquing work in a critical way because you know he really wants to help you improve your writing. He gives off an amazing atmosphereprobably the best one I've had in a workshop class. I would take another one of his classes again :),"Ted is someone who will treat you like an adult. He won't put on child gloves like some of the MFA students in the department do. He won't tell you what you want to hear, he'll tell you what you need to hear: the truth about your writing. If you want to get better, I recommend him. If you want to go nap in a bed of daisies, take someone else.","Ted is a rare combination of a brilliant writer and a brilliant teacher. He's brutally honest. He won't tell you what you want to hear and he has made kids cry in workshop. That being said, he's surprisingly approachable and super committed to making sure his students get better. If you are serious about writing, this class is invaluable.","i loved how his vibes were so chill. this class was based on 5 papers written periodically through out the semester. he grades honestly and provides constructive feedback. he always said don't write to please him, just to get the point across. one of my favorite teachers.","He was very laid back. Apparently he was a tough grader, but I never got anything lower than an 85 on my papers. I'd highly recommend him.","Cool guy I guess. Likes to swear in class, so he isn't like 90% of teachers/professors. But at the same time, his classes aren't easy. He grades tough. If you wanna do well, you have to write the way he wants it to be written. Listen closely in class and you should do okay. Also, he's lax on attendance but skipping alot will hurt ur grade in theend",He's an okay teacher. He's a little  low-brow for my tastes. I took the class so that I could have help with academic writing - instead we mostly do creative writing.,No Comments,"While I wouldn't call him hard, he is a stickler when it comes to grading.  If you're looking for an A you'll be frustrated.  Easy to get a B however.  The class itself is uselss but required."

He uses every class to display his love for philosophy, and he is fantastic at explaining abstract concepts from the readings. However, do not take the prior warnings about his grading lightly - supplement this course with an easier GenEd to balance out your GPA. I'd still highly recommend this class.","Sanders has a remarkable talent for pedagogy. During lectures he manages to translate abstruse philosophical writing into plain English without oversimplification. He also has a sense of humor. All this being said, he's one of the most brutal graders I've encountered at UIUC. Only take one of his classes if you're truly motivated.","VERY knowledgeable and helpful.

Witty and knowledgable.,"Sanders is one of the best philosophy teachers at Illinois, he loves what he teaches and makes the material very understandable",Kirk is a great guy. But he grades WAY TOO HARD.,"As everyone else noted, Sanders is BRILLIANT. However his intelligence seems to be my downfall, he grades papers with unreasonably high standards-and though he will go out of his way to help you revise papers and talk during office hours, he will still end up returning papers with just as many comments and corrections as the original draft.","Learning ancient Greek is definitely not easy, but he does a great job teaching it.  He is really helpful and is super clear. Not to mention that he actually wants his students to succeed in his class. He is also pretty funny, which makes class more enjoyable.  Overall, great professor.",i wish he would stop grading our papers as if we're harvard students...=(...we're just mediocre U of I students...seriously...harsh grader,taking his hellenistic philosophy this semester. AWESOME teacher.,"Like other comments, ancient philosophy has never been my interest before I went to this class. Professor Sanders *always* has a clear explanation on almost every single topic that we discussed in class. He also has a good sense of humor which is very uncommon among philosophy professors here at the U of I!","Like another person posted, Ancient Philosophy is never the most intersting thing, but he is a wonderful professor for it. He is very clear on what he expects and explains the reading well, which helps greatly with Aristotle. I would reccomend him for any Philosophy class as he puts in jokes and will take questions throughout his lectures. Good guy","Ancient philosophy is a bore no matter whom you take it with, but Professor Sanders does a fantastic job with what he has. He's a really bright and witty guy who makes Plato and Aristotle clear. The midterm and final aren't hard if you've been keeping up with notes and lectures (go to office hours, it's really helpful)."

Material in readings/lectures does not appear the same in assessments. Assignments are unclear and almost no guidance is provided for them.","He will explain patiently whenever you ask him. Quizes are easy. There is a bunch of work to do for final project, but it's really helpful.",Takes attendance everyday. Tough to understand but his quizzes are decently easy. The content is pretty so it makes up for Sar being pretty confusing.,Interesting class
1604653,1.5,Jaya,Sarkar,3,0.4679831352009618,"Took MCB 450 for minor requirement; absolutely ridiculous amount of information to memorize.  She basically reads the textbook to you and then asks you detailed fill-in-the-blank questions during exams. Class average was extremely low, so they applied a ""generous"" curve of 1%.","The most unengaging and robotic instructor I've had. Sarkar appeared unconcerned with student success in the class, racing through 60-slide (!) powerpoint presentations at breakneck speed. Grade based on just three exams, one of which is a cumulative final worth 50% of the total grade. Class average was 66%, a C by the scale. You teach yourself.","this class was extremely hard. it has WAY too much information, especially for a summer class. the tests are very difficult and the class is out of 400 points-just 3 tests and a final"
1948105,5.0,David,Sarlah,2,0.8467879296913153,"Awesome professor, makes lecture enjoyable and easy. Goes at a comfortable pace and explains everything thoroughly!",One of the best professors I ever had.
398642,4.9,Awa,Sarr,4,0.7373075140473815,minimal effort will get you an A.,"Great teacher, makes concepts really easy to understand, take her!","Great class, not really a blowoff but pay attention and ask questions in class for pete sakes. study two hours outside class usually, one hour before tests and an half hor before quizes. Thats all you need. She makes the language and culture real vivid makes you want to go to Senegal. just don't ignorant. easy A if you just put a LITTLE effort",I liked her a lot. She works hard to make sure the class understands relevant concepts prior to exams.
1109126,4.4,Dilip,Sarwate,4,0.5355580197417024,"He is the most kind professor I met in U of I. Some other ECE professors always tend to trick you and make the exam impossible, however, Prof. Sarwate just wants you to learn. So he makes his hwks helpful and exam just for you to get an easy A. I suggest take his class, the professor himself is the nicest person I've ever met in U of I","Although HW's level is not same as what he teaches..his teaching ability is great. Two midterms are similar to the previous exams. However, the final exam is xxxxing hard(AVG 40%)","A very intelligent professor who knows his probability theory. Given that his class is ""optional"" due to the online slides, he will try to make sure all his students understand the material he teaches. The exams and its grading are another story. The grading is quite harsh (very little partial credit opportunities) and some exams are very hard.","Lectures definitely aren't boring, though they are gratuitous in the sense that you can get all of the information from the lecture slides. He makes jokes, though often subtle and sometimes purposefully lame, in order to make the lectures more interesting - the only reason you should attend is if you want to hear them."
683260,4.7,Sarah,Sass,3,0.6171157673746612,AB Pscyh is a really good class and Sarah was a great TA.  you should definitely sign up for this class.,sarah is a great TA. she is clear to understand.  she isnt boring like some of the other abnormal psychology TAs.  she is really understanding about missing class.  her quizzes are pretty easy and she grades papers really easily.,"Clear notes, interesting projects.  Fun class to take, especially with Sarah."
557580,4.6,Pete,Sauer,8,0.728295023331434,Lt. Col. Peter Sauer is by far the best professor I have ever met. He is very funny but still teaches the class very. His exams are very fair. Very Worth. Much Good.,"Very kind and easygoing, always glad to help students. Best professor I have ever met in U of I","His lectures are primarily him solving the homework problems. He didn't usually give an introduction to the material - he'd just start solving the homework on the board, while skipping steps that were too math-intensive. As a professor, I'd say he's a little bit better than having a good solutions manual.","The best professor I have ever met. He is very friendly and easygoing professor, great mentor, great teacher, great person. He is knowledgeable and wise. He makes course materials crystal clear. He is also very famous professor in his area, you will learn a lot if you have chance to talk with him about your career or coursework.",Great professor. Fair exams and explains the material very well in lecture.,"Sauer is really laid back and an easy going guy.  He knows what he's talking about and will admit it if he doesn't.  He also takes you on a field trip and is real flexible with the class scheduling seeking class input.  Overall, a great professor.","Sauer is awesome. Very jovial, very knowledgeable. If you have the chance, make this guy your prof.",Probably the best teacher I have had at U of I.

Classes are essentially discussion-based or prep for events at the museum. Also, Anne is extremely funny. It's a very fun class. Take it before you're a senior!!! so you can keep volunteering!","Sautman is a great person and a good facilitator, also knowledgeable about the museum business as well.",Love her!,"I can't say enough great things about Professor Sautman. Her Museums in Action class is probably one of the best I've taken. Anne is really cool and has a ton of art museum experience, but she also trusts students to stay involved and get the job done (You get to plan and lead events and tours for the Krannert Art Museum). Grading is very fair too."

1836934,5.0,Jasmina,Savic,2,0.7308071110294587,I had Jasmina for  the kind of teacher you don't like to disappoint. She's very supportive and helpful for those who are struggling. She explains concepts well and makes it clear she considers your education important. She's usually pretty happy and upbeat. Loved taking her class.,"Jasmina is a very thoughtful teacher, she makes learning fun and I was really sad when I ended up having a different Russian teacher for my other sections. I hope she gets hired on as  faculty because I think she has a real passion for teaching and she is an amazing person. By the way, her favorite Russian word is ""pilasos"", giggles will ensue."
367685,4.0,Julia,Saville,24,0.5327733864357991,"It's true that Julia is a tough grader, but she will give you the grade you deserve. If you half ass a paper, don't expect a good grade. But if you put in some work, it'll reflect in your grade. She gives awesome feedback and helped me understand what exactly wasn't working in my rough draft. She's definitely made me a better writer.",Pros: She knows her class material very well and seems to genuinely enjoy Victorian literature.  Cons: A very tough grader and sometimes hard to understand.,"Don't take this class if you value your GPA. She is an incredibly tough grader. The best you will do in this glass is a B. Not an easy A, she is very traditional and old fashion. There is not even a compass site. Very British.","Strange Victorian Love Poetry. One of my favorite Engl professors. She does have high expectations on papers and participation, but if you work hard and try hard you'll do well and get a lot out of the class. Not only does she teach you the material/content but she gives you great ways to approach writing, reading, and interpretation. Very sweet","She's a great person but requires her students to know/try very hard. She was slightly difficult to work with when I was confused and didn't clearly guide me in one direction, however she is understanding and will at least attempt to help you.","Professor Saville is an amazing teacher.  She really pushes you to try you improve yourself.  She was always willing to meet with students one on one.  She is passionate about Victorian Literature, which is contagious.","Had very little interest in this class prior to attending lecture, as I am not a big Victorian literature person. And though it's still not my favorite, Professor Saville definitely helped me understand the readings. There are quite a few readings for the class, but a lot of them are poems with only two 200ish pg novels. Attend lecture! It helps!","OK, so Professor Saville is the most interesting English professor I have ever had! Her accent is great and when she does her different voices and acts out the poems she is great! You need to go to class and you have to read because she will give you small hints for exams that will definitely help from going to lecture!",Her accent gives an already interesting topic a lot more fun.  The work load is expected and they do push you to do you best. Overall a great professor,Professor Saville is extremely intelligent and is dedicated to her students. I agree that she's a nice lady who expects a lot out of her students. Her class isn't easy but you can get an A. Talk to her about papers before you turn them in; it helps a lot.,She has a fun South African accent that makes her reading poetry to you very entertaining.  She is a nice lady and expects a lot out of her students.,"She is a nice teacher and she enjoys Victorian love poems.  You def have to put in the work into your papers in order to get a decent grades.  Going to her office hrs help a lot. However, some lectures are boring.","Professor Saville is one of those great teachers you enjoy listening to. She is so passionate about teaching and about the material that you can't help but care about it too. She is funny and quirky and loves her students. She will challenge you, but you'll appreciate it. Take a class with her before she retires! She's amazing!","I love this woman.I was going to switch my major, but decided to stay in English because of her.Have taken 2 classes with her (210 &amp; an honors seminar)and honestly, she is incredible-&gt;but you have to put in the effort.I definitely recommend going to office hours, where she is much more laid back and is willing to talk to you for as long as you need","I would have preferred Gillen Wood, but Prof. Saville was a fair second choice. Very knowledgeable and sometimes funny and I enjoy poetry, so it was a good experience for me. Workload was what I expected--a lot of writing on the final, but no nasty surprises.","Not bad, not fascinating.  You have to take this course so you might as well take it with her.  Gives lecture notes, which only help if you attend lecture.  Not a huge deal if you miss.  Readings ok- waaaay too much poetry.  two 5 page papers, a midterm, and a final, weekly half page responses for discussion sections.  overall, not difficult.",Incredibly boring. Her overhead slides make absolutely no sense and she spends the majority of the lecture reading from the textbook even though the readings have already been assigned. Take 210 with a different professor.,"She's quirky and cool and she makes you WANT to learn, which is remarkable because I didn't care about the material in the beginning, but I so did at the end. You'll probably have to do group work though, which can be annoying.","I really dislike modern British Literature, but at least it was remotely bearable with Prof. Saville.",She made me realize that I actually like poetry alot.  Even after going through terrible English teachers in High school.

1162720,4.2,Eric,Schaaf,3,0.5609179024663392,HE TEACHES AT ISU. His class is somewhat challenging if you are taking it as a Gen Ed. Two tests and two papers make up the class grade. He is very good about speaking with you if you are struggling. I would recommend him!,"Eric is really helpful, and is really kind. He never has a bias on topics in philosophy, an the class is extremely interesting- partly because he is SO HOT!",Class just started. Seems like a nice guy! Wondering what everyone else thinks ... Material is kind of hard to understand without twisting your brain!
329473,2.4,Richard,Schacht,7,0.26148292814967966,"Schacht is a smart man, but an awful teacher. He lectures the entire class period and leaves no time for questions. The rare times when someone does ask a question, he typically has a sarcastic and rude reply that doesn't clarify anything, but rather makes the person who asked the question feel inferior for asking it.",His lectures are really boring. He uses language that goes over your head at times. You're better off reading the material to understand it than listening to him teach it.,"THE MOST dull class I've ever sat through in my entire life. And I love philosophy. You couldn't pay me enough money to take another class of his again. And on top of the boredom, he is in general an unpleasant person. No... spark. Boo.",****in a there's no discussion.  i know i'd rather hear the material from someone who knows it inside an out than listen to the idiotic opinions that emerge in discussion-oriented classes.,"Schacht does not believe in class participation.  Although 411 was formally a lecture-discussion class, there was no discussion and not even any questions asked during class.  Visiting Schacht in office hours is an intimidating experience.  Easy if only b/c Schacht did none of the actual grading himself.","Schacht has his good and bad qualities. The 12/03 evaluation isn't far off; his classes are exclusively lectures, with no participation, and at times can get quite boring On the other hand he knows the material well and conveys it effectively, works the readings and lectures into a comprehensive whole, and makes excellent selections of topics/work","All lecture, no discussion. Boring. Very boring. Taking notes = unnecessary. Showing up to class = also unnecessary. Managed to make interesting material as dull as dull could be."

That's never happened to me before, so that's how you know Spencer is the man.","As great as this professor was, his work is just too damn hard! How the hell does he expect students to code an ENTIRE WEBSITE! I signed up for an ADVANCED RHETORIC class. I would expect my Rhetoric to be ADVANCING. All I wanted to to be the next Hemming Way... instead I got... Edward Snowden mixed with Jenna Marbles???"
