DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS.,"No rubrics provided. Grades all given subjectively based on his opinion of the student, not the actual work. I approached him multiple times asking why and how he marked things off on my papers and he never had an intelligent response. Refuses to give a 100 on any assignment, even if he made no corrections the highest score he'll give is a 95.","Go to office hours, ask questions, and you'll be fine.  He just wants to see effort from his students - if you show that you're invested in the very easy class, that means a lot.","This is kind of a weird class. You'll probably get an A and if not certainly a B, and it's really useful to build your resume writing skills. But the group projects and some of the assignments are just way too much work for no reason. There's pretty much something due every class but it's usually only like one page of writing.","He doesn't have a rubric for the class. He can just mark everything off if he feels like it, and that is what he actually does. He DOES NOT GRADE FAIRLY. He definitely gives good grades to people he likes. Very subjective. If he teaches BTW250, do not take it.","From experience, very bad professor. He grades very subjectively. No matter how much work you put in, or no matter how many times you go to workshop, you will get the same grade. He is an English major, not business major but teaching a business course. He does not have a rubric so he can give whatever grade hewants","This class was a waste of time and I learned absolutely nothing. The professor doesn't explain what he really wants in a paper. Several times I went to writers workshops and never got an ""A"".  A classmate of mine worked at the career center for editing resumes and got a ""C"" on her resume. I recommend NOT taking this class with Kelly.","Graded subjectively. Waste of time. Even when I went to writers workshop everytime, I got a B- for the work. Should try to avoid his class. Picky Prof.","Class is an easy A - almost a total blowoff. All we do is write a resume &amp; cover letter, then a couple of short assignments and open book quizzes. If you get anything less than an A in this class you put absolutely no effort into it b/c he lets you rewrite every grade B- or less. How people fail open book quizzes is beyond me...","pretty stupid class. taught poorly. Too much work.  Basically an assignment due when there was a class. I wish that I did not take a class with him, even though I expected to get a good grade in this class(above B+).","This class is hilariously easy. If you have any idea how to write and are willing to give minimal amounts of effort, you will get an A. As for Kelly, he doesn't seem to understand business at all, which is odd for a business writing class. Don't expect to learn too many things from this class.","This class was mundane. The class was difficult but I did get an A. If you have to take the class, you will be fine, but it will not be preferable. He gives recommendations on what to write about, and you need to follow his recommendations. Keep your papers basic, to the point, and based on what he says in class and you will get an A on the essays.","This class is really easy. We had a lot of quizzes, but they were open book. There is one large client project at the end but other than that, there are short papers (like a resume) due throughout the semester. Pretty Easy. I got an A.","Laidback &amp; helpful guy. Attend his office hours and ask him for critique on paper, he'll give great advice - follow them and you should get a good grade (I was able to get many As doing this). He has rewrite option for first couple papers. Quizzes in class - pretty easy and later on, open book. Not a blow off class, still need to put work into it",this guy is really laid back.  He made this class a joke when i have heard nightmares about other prof's for this class.

Kind of screws students in that respect.,He brought the class to life at 8am. I enjoyed the fact that he got to know majority of the studnets in a 300 person class. He is very6 down to earth. If you read and study your material it should be an easy class.,Very easy class... If you have a simple chemistry background from high school it shouldn't be too difficult. It takes hard work and studying but its reasonable... but the TAs don't help very much at all.,Worst class I ever took. He goes off in so many different directions that there wasn't even a point to going to lecture. His study guides are no help. He doesn't make up the online quizzes so you can get ****ed over there too. His T.A.s suck too.,"Not helpful, focuses more on being a friend than teaching, not good with lower level courses, does more demonstrations than needed which makes a fun class and not much learned.  I learned everything from my lab t.a.","I ended up not going to lecture by the end of the semester because I didn't feel like I was getting much of out of them.  He tends to go off on tangents and not actually teach the material.  He is, however, the deparmental head, I think, so if you're a chem major, you might want to get to know him."

Runs an easy course where moderate effort is returned with a good grade. Offers a ton of optional extra credit. Online quizzes are fairly simple so long as you have the textbook on hand.","There is a lot of material covered in the class so that's no fun.

He's also happy and a nice guy. Take it.","First off, by far one of the coolest classes I have ever taken. The professor is a straight up dog! He's super nice, funny, and helpful. He assigns a bunch of extra credit and very little EASY homework. Exam is easy if you just review your homework. Once again awesome teacher.",Professor Kemball is great! He is seriously so nice and will help you with anything you need. The class was very interesting and he kept your attention with the fascinating things you learn about Astronomy. He definitely knows what he is talking about and overall doesn't assign too much homework. 1 assignment a week...and reading...def recommended!,"This guy is so helpful; if u do his homework carefully u would definitely get a high mark on the exam. 80% of the exam questions are among the homework which is once a week. And if u do good on mid-term, u could replace the relative part in the final with the score u achieved earlier. The best prof ever.","GREAT professor. He knows what he is teaching and really enjoys it.

He is very approachable and friendly. He realizes this is just a gen ed, but he still managed to keep my interest.He had open office hours for 8 hours the day of the final because that's just the kind of guy he is.

I have come to this professor with many issues and to be honest she has shown me a lack of consideration. Nevertheless, the course is interesting.","Professor Kendall's lectures were extremely boring. Each lecture has few slides with almost no visual aid and so this makes it very difficult to stay attentive in her class. The course material is interesting, though. Every week had 2 reading summaries which were easy but a pain in the butt. Overall, easily passable but boring course.","Lori is a very boring lecturer who rarely excites the class. The course is based on reading summaries, some of which are very interested. Luckily, you need not attend class and listen to Lori drag on about the exact same material you read about. I'd advise against taking one of Lori's classes if you don't have to.","No slides share, obscure instructions(she often just read stuff from her own materials a lot of time without showing them on the slides, she just expect you to catch the story solely based on her standing there and reading, LoL). Walk through slides fast so you better be fast at note-taking.","It's fun class. I really enjoyed all the topics covered in the lecture. Although there were a lot of readings to do and all the summaries were driving me crazy, I really enjoyed this class. Very relevant and close to our daily lives. Loved the class.","She is a great lecturer. I actually enjoyed her class. Most of the things covered in the lectures are very relevant to real life.

If you do online though, watch out for the TA... grading can get harsh.","Math 225 is not a difficult class conceptually, and Kerman does a serviceable job at lectures. You don't really need to go to class to be honest but that's just because the material isn't hard to pick up on your own.",Very clear in his speaking and notation. Conveys points well.,"He wrote his notes on the board. He did not look at the class at all, just talked to the board. I never knew what were good problems to look at that would help study for the exams. He made the second test ridiculous compared to the first and third one. Not much of a curve on any of them. He definately is the hardest teacher for calc 1.","He only copies his notes onto the board and speaks it out loud as he writes. It's kind of hard to figure out if you should even take notes or just watch because he just writes and writes the entire class without much interaction. It's almost as if he's writing the book on the board, and math books are not easy to understand. Do the online homework!","Sometimes seems nervous in class.  Has trouble understanding students' questions, and therefore answering them.  Test questions more difficult than information covered in class.  But, if you do all homework and pay attention, you can do well in the class.","I slacked more than I should have, but even so, I had no idea what would appear on the first test (and bombed it).  The rest of the tests were reasonable.

Did he attend an accredited university?,"This was the worst experience of my life. I never felt so lost in a class until I had this ""professor."" Half the time he didn't know if he was right or wrong while doing examples on the board. Not to mention, the practice problems he gave us before exams had wrong solutions.

Don't take this class just for him because he doesn't teach the whole time.","Definitely one of the best professors I've had at UIUC.  He provided a great and broad overview of Islam, and he was always available for questions.","By far my favorite professor at UIUC. Cares soo much about his students, class is never boring even when the topic can get dry sometimes, and he's so enthusiastic about his work and teaches with a passion. I asked him for a letter of recommendation and he's more than happy to write that for me as well. Definitely take a class with him if possible.","Professor Khalil was a fantastic teacher.  He loves the material, he speaks well, and, most importantly, he cares so much for his students.  Great class, great teacher.",No Comments,"Very interesting course, brings in guest lecturers for all religions except Islam (he does that one). He's a very motivated lecturer and keeps you interested. However, beware of the grading system because missing two discussion sections (quizzes) can knock your grade down by 7-8%!","He is an excellent professor. Very funny and interesting. He's unbiased even though he's talking about his own religion. The class was pretty easy overall, I got an A- and could have gotten an A with a bit more work. Attendance is random... he only takes 5 of them. Papers were kinda tough though unless you spend a bit of time on them.",I agree with what everyone else said. This guy is the man. The best professor I've had at this school. Very knowledgeable. U of I is luck to have him.,"This guy is the man.  Best professor I have ever had on this campus.  He loves teaching, wants to get to know you, well help you with whatever you need, and grades fairly.  You have to go to class and do some work, but it is worth it.

His tests aren't that easy, you really have to study pretty well but he gives a very comprehensive study guide that helps.","Funny, entertaining, objective and very helpful. I disagree though, grading is quite lenient; I got by with a B without doing much reading for class. Hope he teaches an upper level before I graduate, the general ones cover too much/move too fast to get a good grasp on anything in particular but he's got a lot of knowledge in his field.","AMAZING PROFESSOR! He engages the students in discussion and is very passionate and objective about what he teaches. Take ANY class that he's teaching, you won't regret it!","Absolutely wonderful class! He is a very engaging professor and extremely knowledgeable. If you have any interest in Islam this class is definitely worth it. He's a great professor, the class is both very interesting and not difficult.","He is an AMAZING professor. He's funny in class, grading is quite fair (in my opinion), and the course is not an overload on work. I am also learning a lot about Islam in his class. MK seems pretty objective in his presentation of the religion, which can be hard to do when it's your own faith. I HIGHLY recommend taking any class that he's teaching.",Amazing professor!!! UIUC is lucky to have him in the Religious Studies Department. He is extremely fair and knowledgeable when he grades and teaches. He is hilarious in class; sometimes I can't stop laughing. You must take his class if you have a spot in your schedule!!!

I would recommend him no matter what. Expect to work in 120.",Kindratenko is kind and talks to you like you have never heard the material before. His lectures were chock-full of information that helped me get an A. He could've gone a little slower in the middle portion of the semester but pace was perfect otherwise.,"A fantastic lecturer able to cover everything in the perfect amount of detail. He does not waste your time, that would be your fellow classmates who ask uneducated questions i.e. Syndrome. Accent is easy to understand and he has an extremely advanced and in depth knowledge of anything else you will need to know, super computers etc.",That Russian accent though.,"I took it over the summer and I think this is the first time they offer this class for summer semester. To be honest, the tests are fair and I think they are easier than the tests from normal semesters because it will cover all topics in 8 weeks. Prof. K is very patient to students and the practice exams are very similar to the actual exam.","This class is difficult. It's definitely not impossible, but you're going to have to work for it. The homeworks are long and require a lot of independent learning. The labs are ok. The exams are tough, but reflect concepts from the HWlectures. Prof Kindratenko is a great lecturer and is really helpful in office hours. You'll learn a lot with him.","Kindratenko is a great teacher. I took his ECE120 class and to be honest, it was unnecessarily difficult, but that's college. He's helpful when you ask for it. Pro tip: always go to  his office hours to review your graded tests with him. He may give back a lot of points!","Good class, it does gradually get harder but as long as you master the concepts and design process, still an easy A. Dr. Kindratenko specializes in GPU computing, he's quite knowledgeable in organization and algorithms. His lectures can be interesting or boring depending on whether you like the subject or not, but great accent!","The class was ok but as a person, he Agent K is very condescending.  When asked a question, make sure it is an ""intelligent"" one or else he will mock you","Great guy. The class is a tough class and he definitely doesn't baby his students. Overall, take his class. Great guy and an awesome accent.","I took ECE190 last semester and dropped it. Now it makes more sense,","He co taught this class with Loui. I really enjoy his style of teaching. He is straight forward, knows what he's talking, and all around good teacher. Def a good experience with him as a teacher for a class I don't really enjoy","Awesome lecturer! His russian accent can sometimes make it hard to understand, but he's great at explaining concepts, and he's funny too! Best prof for ECE 190."
493548,2.5,Jeffrey,Kindt,1,0.5766562204643592,"Easy professor. There is a 10% curve and if you do extra credits you will get 1% for each e.c. you do. He is funny in his own way.

536569,3.1,John,Kindt,41,0.4211346101984431,"Worst class I have taken at UIUC so far. His glory days were 30 years ago and he is washed out and uninformed of current issues. Gives extra credit points out to people for doing meaningless tasks. If the class is not mandatory, do not take.","I signed up to tell you how awful   is. I have always gone to class and never slacked off. But he grades you by only two things. Literally your grade is determined by TWO THINGS. One of which is Law Memos, for which he does not give you specific guidelines on how to do stuff, so you are really on your own. Worst experience in my life. Drop clss","He is such an inspiring Professor! Some people may find his class worthless, but it is because they never attend/pay attention to his lectures. Throughout the semester, he only gives a law memorandum assignment worth 80% of your grade and 20% final exam. The memorandum was a chaos task but the class notes definitely helped me A LOT.","I think he's a good guy, but he is undoubtedly the worst teacher I've ever had, and this was the worst class I've ever taken. His lectures teach you nothing. If you end up needing to take the final, there isn't anything to study because nothing worthwhile was discussed in class. He has a policy that he won't communicated w students via email.","The first C I ever received on my class, taught nothing but kept joking, his content might be useful in the future but unfortunately he barely mentioned things beneficial to the Final exam.","He didn't use class time effectively. Rambled about various topics (gambling, how 1st amendment rights would be challenged in the future) for half the class before moving to the lecture notes. I did learn basic business law topics. Lots of extra credit offered. He is retiring this year.","He would be more well suited to teach in a high school setting. I know he's nearing a career exit but I could picture that working out for him. But in a role where learning is more valuable and efficient, like a major university, he just doesn't cut it. I know he's probably close to retirement but he should consider going to the high school level.","If you don't enjoy Kindt's class, I question your personality. Yes, his tests don't really match up to his lectures, but he gives MOUNDS of extra credit and curves the class. You learn applicable real-life law examples that will stick with you beyond the class and you'll probably enjoy it. How can you complain? I genuinely enjoyed coming to class.","He doesn't teach at all. All that he said was ""do citation and you will be on top of the pyramid."" After his classes, I didn't learn the basic legal knowledge as much as the other students in other professors' classes. I had to read Roszkowski's book to review for his exam. What a sarcasm! Don't ever choose his class if you want to take CPA!",Easily the greatest professor I've EVER had. Take him now! Don't think about it. Just do it. You will not be displeased. As long as you show up and express interest you will get a good grade! All other professors at U of I PALE in comparison to him.,homework : easy                  Final : very hard( not multiple choice)                        extra credit : a lot,Prof.Kindt is the easier and also the nicest professor ever!!! I love him. I do lol,Professor Kindt has truly had an impact on my learning.  He's the only teacher in the college of business where there is a CLEAR link between what we do in class and what is going on in the real world.  Every day he brings in articles to show just how what we learn can be found in the real world.  He also keeps the class laughing!,"Best Teacher I've Ever Had! Don't take the other loser Business teachers at U of I. Take Kindt! He easy-going, approachable, and you learn a lot! All these people leaving bad reviews are just bitter because they didn't show up to class and got a bad grade. As long as you attend and show him you're interested, you will do fine in the class!","A rare gem of a dieing era of teaching. Learned a great deal on contract law, agency, and legal citations. Wish I had other professors like Kindt who engaged their students with examples to help understand the content. Created a great learning environment. The course made me think in new ways legally. I will miss the course and professor.","Easiest class offered by the business school. He gives so much extra credit, you could average a 70 the exams and still get an A. If you actually want to learn something about business law, I recommend taking another professor.","Wasted money to buy his class notes, which are pretty much empty. He does a great job in explaining what he intends to explain, but you don't learn much about business law in this class. His tests are tough, as they aren't based on what he lectures in class. Half of his first test is on citations. If you want to learn something, take another Prof.",Learned absolutely nothing about business law. It was a waste of time to go to class. We had 2 projects which was doing his gambling research and citations for him so he could use them in his next book. Easy grader and I'm pretty sure literally every student got an A in the class. He offered like 120 pts and you just needed 90 to get an A,All he does is talk about anti-gambling. He doesn't clarify assignments very much so everyone is confused. We need to spend 99 dollars for online class notes which doesn't have anything inside and totally waste of money. Besides that you also need to buy a textbook on anti-gambling. What a waste if money for a horrible class. If it weren't a requirement I would never take it.,"I found myself wondering why i went to class. But you need to if you want to do extra credit(aka citations)unless you know others, you can skip class. Test material is like 10% based off what he went through in class. 1st test was an easy A, the other 2 tests were more difficult. But he provides ex. cred. chances with citations, which are easy."

You can tell he's more used to teaching the 400-level students that care about Systems. He overall wasn't very helpful in adapting to problems students had. Never very helpful with MPs. His final was a complete train wreck. 241 is just awful in general, but he didn't help the situation any.","Good professor with a good understanding of material and a clear way of expressing this to the class.  Go to lecture and you will do well on the exams.  The class is pretty easy, and he's very patient with answering questions, often getting behind on his own material to ensure everyone understands.","Excellent professor. His explanations are clear and he's very helpful both within and outside the class. He is also very patient with slower students, something missing in many CS professors. Exams are fair and based off his lectures. Don't hesistate to ask questions if you have doubts!"

I'll keep my book and notes as a memory. Truly inspiring. He's nice.","Very enthusiastic about the subject matter and gives great lectures when he doesn't send the TA. Unfortunately, the quizzes are tedious and really test understanding, and often involve assumptions that were never taught. Grading is tough. You WILL have to read the book and go to homework help if you want to pass. The final was easy to compensate.","The class is set up for failure, with how much quizzes and the final are worth and how tough the grading is. Very condescending. DO NOT take with King if you don't have to. Not worth it.",I wont say he is a bad teacher but he has very poor personal skills he likes to put people on blast when they are late and ask a question and he likes to be very vague on what will be on the quizzes.oh did i mention there are pop quizzes? they are not that hard if you go over the material throughly because he my say its over 3 but its on 1 concept

Though his course is a little boring sometimes, his explanations are very clear and are very generous to students.","One of the worst teachers I've ever had. He teaches straight from slides and just flies through them. Not very good at explaining things. The homework is supposed to be related to the lectures, but the lecture slides often don't explain the problems in any clear way. I would like more theory, and not explained with proofs.","Very helpful teacher and makes a pretty boring subject kind of fun. His lecture slides are so good that you don't really need to attend class, I think that still considers him a great teacher","Taken 3 courses with him; he runs them all the same. Longwinded as a lecturer, covers every detail. Homework is usually comically easy, usually just pretty much reworking examples from lecture. Tests are a tad more difficult. Really cares about student success and was extremely helpful and friendly both in class and at office hours.","Very helpful and great lecturer. IE 300 (statistics) can get boring at times, but he explains the material very well. He is also very willing to help and cares about students. He says to always expect pop quizzes, but they are few and far between.",good lecture slide but the lectures are boring.,"His slides are amazing and should be published.  He is so good at explaining the material. He is a very good teacher. Breaks down theories and problems very well. He is helpful, funny, and straightforward.","All his homework and midterms are super easy and the steps to solving the problems are on his slides. BUT, he is a boring boring boring professor. BUT super easy. Very recommended for his easiness.","Doug's courses are all well-prepared and hw n exams are both based on his nice slides. HOWEVER he is sometimes ridiculously stubborn and not willing to accommodates on attendance/quizzes for unavoidable ones in favor of students' grade. Thus, good quality course but unfriendly instructor.",His exams are similar to his homeworks and lecture slides. He is very easy to follow because his slides are the same as what he says in class.,"This instructor is BORING. I believe we have more than 80 people in our session, only 15 of them attend his class, and 10 of 15 are doing their own business or sleeping. He use poorly made and confusing slides as his class material. No related homework, no exercise or past exam for midterms. Btw, he wont receive late hw, even 1 s late.(it happened)","Best and most logical teaching method so far. Exams are very fair, know the homework well and you will do well in exams. Good lectures and excellent lecture slides. Teacher definitely knows  what he is talking about and is organized . Has humor.","He is the new professor. He is really good in explaining the material and is really passionate in teaching. He is though really strict about assignment deadlines and the exam policies, but it's not a big deal. His lecture notes are really self-explanatory, so you don't have to go to lectures. Reasonable exams, do the homework and you'll be fine."

The university should be glad to have her. A+","She is a nice Japanese teacher and always willing to help anyone who struggles in the class.

Amazing class, it's obvious he loves philosophy.","Korman is one of the best professors I've ever had. He is so passionate about what he teaches and is always willing to meet up and help with whatever questions you have. Grades are mostly based around 1 paper, but you work on it throughout the semester and he gives feedback. Great class!","Great lecturer. Made it so interesting, he really loved teaching the class; it was obvious. The T.A.'s were helpful too.","Korman is probably one of the best professors at UIUC. You can tell he enjoys teaching. His lectures are not only engaging, but also thought-provoking. You do have to write a lot in his class, but Korman and his T.A.'s are always willing to help. I would recommend students to take his classes. You will definitely see the world differently.",He genuinely loves philosophy. Always around to help students. very good lecturer. there are weekly readings for the class and a total of eleven papers. none of them are too hard though.,"Dan Korman is so cute! Only reason I went to lecture. If you don't read, just make sure you go to lecture and you'll do fine. Got A-'s and B+'s on all essays.","Good professor, has a true passion for Philosophy although a lot of times he seems to come up with realizations of certain things while in class. He is welcoming and will be friendly if you like to chat about 'Philosophy' during office hours or after class, especially if you are a girl. Pay attention and you will do well :)",Korman keeps things relevant and approaches sensitive issues carefully. He seems somewhat progressive and may not fully grasp your argument if you don't lean that way. He does like discussion and allows differing POVs to be expressed in class. He also makes himself available outside of class and seems to love philosophy - loves to chat after class.,"Class wasn't too bad. attendance not mandatory. However, DON""T take the section with Bowen AJ as TA if you care about your GPA. He sucks. Don't know what he's talking about. Gives out wrong information most of the time. Doesn't seem to understand basic course content."

I have only received one graded paper back and we are finished with the semester. He is awful. I have to take advanced comp next year and am so unprepared because of him. AVOID HIM.,worst teacher I've ever had. the entire class is ran by how he feels on that particular day. He assigns papers on things only he cares about,"Quite possibly the worst TA I've ever had. He grades stories on whether he likes them or not without any regard to your style. He constantly makes up stupid rules like ""from now on you can't use exclamation marks"". If he hadn't given me an A in the class I would have gone to his office and raised hell. AVOID having him at all possible."

Super attractive!,"Dr. Korte has been my favorite professor thus far. He is not going to pull any punches when he gives you feedback, but listening to his advice can be most helpful.

Avoid!!!",I agree that Dr. Koshik is a very nice person but her teaching style is seriously detrimental to the training of future teachers.  Her feedback is overwhelmingly negative with little to no positive feedback given to her students. The inflexibility of her teaching style and theoretical beliefs  limits students' potential. If possible avoid.,"Dr. Koshik is a very sweet woman and cares about her students. However, her classes are not useful and the material is antiquated. I would highly suggest NOT taking her classes if you are a graduate student. It's just not very useful. Also, she doesn't grade for attendance in the syllabus, but attending class is in your best interest.","While she often left too much time for small group discussion, she addresses sociolinguistic issues and I feel I actually learned something.","While she sometimes leaves too much time for small group discussion, in general, I learned a lot from Koshik and gained a new appreciation for sociolinguistic differences.","Not very professional; a paradigm warrior -- very committed to her theoretical paradigm and not open to other views; not open to anything at all linguistic or even applied linguistics, as you'd expect in such a dept."

If you read the book, which you will half to do, going to class is useless. He focuses entirely on the Reformation and Ancient Greece and fly's throw or skips everything in between. The Class itself is also very dry.","His lectures aren't that great - I fell asleep whenever I went, and most other people fell asleep too.  The TA's were terrible and I really hope most of them don't become professors, I heard some were alright though. And I agree he did have a weird fetish for balcony people.","He's a decent guy. I fell asleep consistently though. When I did manage to stay awake, it seemed as though he followed his outline, which was much appreciated. He thought he was hysterical and laughed at ALL of his jokes. He had some fetish for the people in the balcony.",Talks way more than necessary. Lots of people slept in class. Laughs at his own jokes a lot. Really knows what he is talking about.,No Comments,I took a Discovery class (only around 20 students) and it was great.  He was very engaging and lively and his grading was fair.,"Knows more about the Reformation era than most could ever hope to. Unfortunately, one dealt mostly with his TA's, who were less than effective, some of the time.  However, if you managed to talk to him outside of his lectures, which were actually pretty good for being so huge, you would definitely get your questions answered fully, and with a smile"

But he is such a good professor that the information simply came to me and the 15-page paper almost wrote itself. He is very passionate and willing to help. Just make sure to read and keep up to date on assignments.","Koslofsky is a really great professor but this class is so broad in topics that you don't really get to see him in his element. Overall, class is pretty straightforward with essays and tests. If history isn't your thing, I don't recommend it, but otherwise really covers the basics of global history enough to pique interest.","You only need to study the key terms and relate them to other terms. THAT IS IT. Lecture is beneficial, as he expands on those terms which will help you on exams. He makes the course much more complicated than it has to be.  REALLY BORING LECTURES. Reading the primary sources is unnecessary, as well.","One of the nicest and most approachable professors ever. Always willing to help you. This class has a large research paper and he is very willing to help. Lots of reading, but no more than any other history class. he's extremely intelligent and passionate about what he does, and humorous as well so he's not just a dud professor.","I had prof Koslofsky last year. He assigns quite a bit of reading, but all professors do.. He is extremely helpful and kind. I recommend seeing him during office hours, it helps him know that you are making an effort. also, his name is Craig not Gregory..","Yup, the lectures are not the most exciting. It is definitely a lot of work for a 100 level class but the grading was fairly easy. There were 2 3-4 page essays to write and exams paragraph form. Not much memorization is needed, just basic knowledge of the concepts and ability to connect aspects of the class together.","I love this professor! I had him in a discovery section, and he was engaging, super nice, and really tried to help students understand the material. His exams were tricky, but he was a fair essay grader. I would recommend this teach to anyone.",Lectures are extremely boring and rarely relate to what is given on the midterm and final exams. Writing a 750 word essay every 2 weeks in a 100 level class and your grade in the hands of your TA makes it worse. Don't recommend him at all.,"This professor was extremely vague.  We had to write five 750-word essays for the class, only one midterm, and discussions were mandatory for a good grade, as 25% of the final grade was participation.  His slideshows were pointless and he was always repeating himself.  TA's all graded differently - do not recommend."

I followed it and was given an F.  Also earlier in the semester she failed me on an outline that I couldn't complete, due to the passing away of my aunt.    Never disliked a teacher so much in my life.",Very easy class that was required for me. She teaches the class for what it is - 5 identical speeches. Fair grader. Recommended.

Always go to class.","think outside the box, take risks. It's worth doing in this class - some teachers  penalize you for it if the risks don't pay off, but in Steve's class, he will respect you for trying and most likely consider this when grading you. fun class, signed up again next semester for artf105",Steve is a great teacher and he tries to get to know his students. He likes challenging his students and he likes seeing 'new' things. Grades pretty hard.,"Really helpful and interesting. He kinda blends in with students, so he's easy to talk to. He also knows what he is talking about, so you'll definitely learn something and won't bust your brain doing it.","Great guy, really helpful.

Steve will be very harsh at critique if you don't show up with something good.",No Comments,Awesome guy. Great class.,Steve is a really LAID BACK guy. He just basically has open studio alot in class.

However, his classes tend to get boring, people tend to skip lectures more and more frequently.

He encourages students who do not understand the material to go to weekly study sessions and office hours.  He also encourages students to ask questions.,"He is very nice to his students and helpful in office hours. He also holds review sessions every week the day before the weekly homework is due, which is also helpful. The class itself is fairly difficult if you aren't great at proving things, but his grading scale is extremely generous. He also gave us 5 exams and took the top 3. Good professor.","Graph theory with Kostochka was a demanding class.  He expects that you memorize all of the propositions, theorems, definitions, etc, so don't fall behind.  I felt that I learned the most from homework sessions he ran, rather than lectures. In class I wasn't sure which details were most important. Generous grading scale. Great Russian accent!","Alexandr (I had him for UG LP), is a nice guy, but tries way 2 hard and needs to follow a clearer approach in lectures. Students in this class already understand LP, because it is mostly grads in CompuSci; beware if ur taking it as UG Math. My advice would be to get to know him and do ur best.

You can tell he cares about his students though and the class should be an easy A with a decent effort.,Dr. K is one of the nicest professors I have ever had. His lectures are straight forward and easy to follow. You do not need the textbook. All of the information for the exams is put on a straight forward study guide. All of the information comes directly from his power points. There are a couple opportunities of extra credit.,"Dr. K is the sweetest and most caring professor at the University. I took this class for fun and decided to pick up poly sci as a double major because he talked me into it. The class is extremely easy if you put in a decent amount of work, but actually go out of your way to meet/talk to him because he's honestly the best.","Lectures could be a bit boring sometimes but as long as you copy down the powerpoints then you should be good. Dr.K is good at making boring material interesting, and he was very helpful outside of class. If you show up to class, then this class should be an easy A",Genuinely a really nice guy and teacher.

All the material she covers in class is available in the lecture notes she uploads before class starts. Make sure you do the textbook readings for the quizzes but there is no need to go over the textbook for the final.,Was not a very good teacher. She tended to force her political opinions on the students and was not very helpful. Would not recommend to anyone,"I have taken so many advanced level courses and while I took this as a Gen Ed, I found it to be even harder than the three advanced courses I was taking. She is so pretentious and is very discouraging whenever you have questions. On top of that tests are worth 35% each and contain little of the information learned in class. Don't take this class.","She wasnt a very interesting lecturer and the topic COULDVE been interesting, but the way she had explained things just was dry.","A great teacher, who covered a lot of material without seeming rushed.

Professor Kranz was awesome.,The exams often test very picky details and there are a lot of passage based questions. Wording of multiple choice makes it easy to miss if there's a slightest bit of doubt in your mind. Honestly this is one of the most relevant MCB courses I've taken. Lots of memorization in the first half. But also an emphasis on understanding.,"Kranz's exams feel like an all immunology version of the MCAT. Passage based questions. Stand alone questions. Emphasis on application. He puts ""More than one answer is true"", ""Both A and B"", ""None of the above"", etc as answer choices to see if you truly understand the material. There is a lot of detailed memorization as well. Not an easy class.",Kranz is a very engaged lecturer but loses focus on topics easily.  Tests are very difficult and questions are tricky/confusing. Overall a difficult course.,"I was in this Class Spring 2010. Professor Kranz is really interested in Immunology and he was lively and engaged at 9 in the morning. The Tests are really hard, but if you study directly off the lecture slides, you can get an A on the 4 lecture exams. Almost all exam material comes directly off lecture slides. Kranz is a nice guy, gives hard tests","I took this class because I heard from fellow upper level MCB students that it was easy.  While the grading scale is generous, lecture is boring and tedious.  Kranz will start one thought without finishing another.  The class is interesting, but it takes a lot of self discipline to take the time out and study properly.","The exams are hard and require a lot of studying however the grading scale is generous (40% a's, 40% b's).  I would recommend having some interest in the material as there is a lot of studying per exam","Excellent professor. He's had a bunch of success in his professional career, but he's still as friendly, accessible and willing to help as can be to the undergrads who take his course, which is generally rare with professors that have had his level of success. The class itself has a very generous curve, and the tests are manageable,take Immunology!",GREAT TEACHER AND CLASS. extremely helpful professor. highly recommend this class to any of you mcbers who are pre-med.  i have never learned so much about immunology.  he keeps the class interested with not only his humor but with random videos that have nothing to do with anything!  plus 40% receive As and 40% get Bs... not bad!  but study hard!,"Damn good, only a bit to fanatical about antibody structure.

But getting an A is easy if you go to class, do the homework and really understand the key concepts. The math does not go beyond basic calculus and matrix.","Unless you are familiar with complicated high level mathematics, do not take financial economics.

From what I heard, I would take him over any other 302 professor...","The final was ridiculously hard for this class. None of the type of problems on the exam were ever given to the students as homework, practice, or web problems.

Most of the test are based from lecture. Nice guy though and he will help if you go to his office hours. I got sick with pneumonia and he was very helpful over email and let me take the test anytime I wanted.,He gets off topic a lot during lectures. Tests are based off of readings.,"Krassa is a boring lecturer, but go anyways. The exams are based off of lecture.","Dear lord, this guy is not a good professor. I passed this class because I knew the constitution and did well in my AP US history class in high school. Krassa also promises podcasts and never posts them, so watch out and don't rely on that. I fell asleep in every lecture, he's that boring. But the TAs saved my ass in this class.","Stay away from any class this guy teaches. His lectures are the most boring I've ever experienced. He writes everything down on paper, barely comes prepared to lecture, talks extremely slow, and always goes off topic. The exam questions are always worded strangely. Even so, the TA's are extremely helpful. They basically teach this class themselves.",class is so dry and boring; the way he lectures contributes to less than 30% attendance every time. barely any prep given for tests and the questions are always worded in the stupidest ways. the TA's are the only saving grace for the class. you can get an A or B if you actually read the whole book and study for years. not what i expected at all.,His lectures are dull and not organized without powerpoints nor outlins. He just writes whatever he wants on a piece of paper. Too much reading materials for a 1evel class. The exams are hard and graded by TAs. He does not talk about anything related to the textbooks. He is very old and should retire.,"If you go to lecture, read your textbook and go to discussion, you will do fine in the class. Tests are not too bad, but your grade primarily comes from three tests.","Possibly the worst professor I've experienced so far. The guy obviously doesn't come prepared for lecture. He just stands and rambles for an hour, mostly about things that aren't even related to the course. The guy's a bad joke. Thank God for the TA's. They could each individually do a better job than him.",The TAs are the saving grace of this class. Krassa's style of lecturing is standing up on stage and sort of stream of conscious-ing whatever he feels is relevant. Completely unprepared for lecture. Get Audrey as a TA. Tests have curveball material on them. Don't take this class unless you have to.,No. Just don't take this class and don't look at the workbook!! Worst decision I've made in college! Who has typos in a college level textbook!? And Early lecture in the SOYBEAN RESEARCH CENTER?! Just trust me...Run away. Your GPA and your sanity will thank me.,"Krassa is a joke. Don't go to class and read the textbook. He holds class in the Soybean building a million miles away and ditches class without notice. Test are hard, but the TA's are awesome. Audrey is AMAZING. He study guides cover 80% whats on the test, but as long as you read the textbook your fine.","Professor Krassa is incredibly approachable, assigns books that are both interesting AND affordable, and leads class in a seminar format.  It was one of my favorite political science classes on this campus.   The topics are interesting and relate to daily life, and the paper assignment is open ended.","Krassa is a joke of a professor. I don't understand why he is still a professor. We NEVER discuss the course information, we NEVER stay on topic, and everyone in the class hates his teaching style. How can you learn if you have the most boring, least inspiring and uninteresting professor in the PS department? EPIC waste of time.",STAY AWAY FROM CLASS WITH THIS PROFESSOR. HE IS NOT CLEAR. YOU WILL NEVER KNOW WHAT IS ON THE TEST. VERY BORING. GOES OFF ON TANGENTS. GRADE MADE UP OF 3 TESTS AND DISCUSSION SECTION GRADE.,"I didn't think it was too hard. I read the book thoroughly and underlined lots of key things along the way so that when it came to the exams, I had less to study. Exams really aren't that hard. AP US in high school was harder. Take good notes and do not just write what he writes down. 9/10 times what he says is what is on the test not what he write",Probably the most boring class.,"This class seemed hard for an introductory course and he did not lecture clearly. Very unorganized and reading the book seldom helped on the exams. You basically have to write down everything he says during lecture to do well on his nearly impossible tests. Overall, he is pretty fair though.","Easy content but he makes it confusing. You don't find out until two tests in that his tests are 60% topics covered in lecture, which is incredibly boring. His textbook is terrible and you can't sell it back.",Terrible professor. Exams are definately a curveball every time. Avoid this guy! He can't stay on topic AT ALL. And one of the things he goes off topic and talks about for 2 min will be on the exam and count for a good chunk of your grade. No curves on exams or anything. He talks kind of funny. that is all

Essays are essentially participation grades and the quiz and exam questions are easily answerable if you listen to his lectures. This is an easy Gen Ed and very interesting for those who care about History.","I took his Civil War class a year ago. He is one of the best teachers I've ever had. Very friendly, funny, approachable, and helpful. Has a clear passion for his work and position. His class is not hard and he tries hard to make it as interesting as possible. Whether you're a history major or looking for a gen ed, his class is great to take.","Dr. Kraszewski is a refreshing professor who is clearly passionate about what he teaches. It helps to be a history nerd yourself, as the readings he assigns can sometimes be dense, but are appropriate given the lessons. He's more than fair with his grading, and I'd strongly recommend him to anyone that needs a 300+ history course.","He is a good professor and I like that he doesn't use slide shows.  I feel I know a lot about the Civil War without doing to much work.  He does go on a lot of tangents, often about books, but they often relate to the Civil War in some way or important topics to history majors.","Readings range from about 50+ pages for each class. Lectures aren't clear because the notes are written on the chalk board. No study guide for midterm. But the professor is nice and likes to joke around, although rambles quite a bit. Won't be an easy A, if anything a B- at best. Final is worth 40% of grade and is comprehensive."

You could work really hard on an MP, and make it work, but she could still create a rubric that, after penalties, renders you with a zero. In essence, for her there is no difference between a functional MP, and someone who did not do the MP at all","CS 438 is a very fun course that can help you land a job, but she knows how to make you feel miserable while taking the course with her. There are other great instructors that teach this course, so if you can, wait and take it with someone who cares about teaching to students and is not so patronizing as her.","The class is an interesting one, and you do learn a lot. However, Prof. Kravets seems to possess a harsh personality, she makes mean comments and  comes off as patronizing. I'd suggest you take this class when some other professors are teaching it.","She's actually better than what the previous comments describe. If you ask her help, she's willing to give you advice. She's a skilled lecturer and  a generous grader as well imo.","Her lectures were pretty well put together. She assigned a large group project worth 50% of the course grade. Then, she dropped the final which was great. Had class presentations that were easy. She had deadlines but changed them all the time. Was very unorganized near the end and doesn't realize we have other classes at the same time. 3/10 class","She's a bit rude to students, but I found her to be a good lecturer. There's a lot of material to cover, and I think she does a good job explaining things at the level that needs to be understood for this course. Lots of code examples in the slides, and if you ask questions she will stop and repeat things. You get more out of it by participating.",Only positive about this class was that there was lecture videos. Robin was extremely rude to students and presented MPs that were near impossible to do based on lecture notes. Really a shame since 241 covers great material. There's good reason this class has the highest failure rate in CS department.,Probably the worst professor in the core CS curriculum. Too bad this CS 241 is required. My suggestions are to attend every lecture no matter how boring and dry she is.,"It takes an outstanding instructor to successfully impart the amount of material in this course in one semester; unfortunately, Professor Kravets may not even be a good one. Her lectures and her marked unfriendliness inspire sparse attendance, but it's in your best interest to be at every class.","The class material is somewhat interesting, but Kravets seems to genuinely dislike all students.","Robin likes to give hand-wavey explanations of complex concepts.  When we ask questions, she gets frustrated.  She seems to get really condescending sometimes, which makes it difficult for students to ask questions when they're confused.","She probably thinks that we, students are her colleagues. Rather than ""teaching"" something , she believes in discussing stuff you've never heard of before. 241 is supposed to be really interesting , only when taught properly and thoroughly. Moreover, gigantic Machine Problems without a partner is TORTURE.","I would agree with the individual that said this class was a disaster.  On average throughout the semeseter, I spent 45-50 hours on a single MP.  No group MPs like previous semesters.  The autograders never worked.  I seriously think this class should be 12 credit hours because I was forced to neglect them due to this class.  Learned a lot though.","This was not a hard class. But there were a lot of assignments including MPs and HWs. But MPs are not that hard (mostly you can get at least more than 90%) and the curve was pretty sweet. You can get A if you are mostly more than 82%. A+ was around %92. So if you finished every assignment and study lecture slides a bit, A/A+ is guaranteed.","Disaster of a class.  The MP autograders didn't work, and we had to fight for points back on every assignment.  Most students spent 50+ hours on most machine problems.

He even gives an extremely helpful study guide.,I  tried to take this class before with different professors and it did not turn out well. I really enjoyed this professor and the class. Go to class and go to discussion and you will be fine. Prof seems kind of nervous but he is very nice. Exams are not bad at all.,"Dr. K is a new professor. For a new professor, he was amazing in his first semester. Specifically, he improved a lot after the midterm evaluations.

Also she has funny math jokes to keep everyone interested!,She is a nice teacher but make sure you don't sneeze around her... She lectures once a week. She jumps into a topic without explaining anything. The tests are very straightforward just make sure you go to her/TA review sessions. Also if you get stuck on HW go to class and she will usually answer your question. Also her accent is not too bad.,"No quizzes or attendance. Go to all review sessions (including ones held by TA's) and it will be an easy A. Split up online HW within your group. She says she includes questions about online HW on exams but I haven't seen that yet. Mathematica is not only an easier courseload, but it's also a lot easier to grasp. Wish I did mathematica in all math","This is my favorite math course and Denka is one of the best professors in UIUC. She is very patient and helpful.

The tests are not hard if you study her notes carefully and read every small detail.,"She was a great professor and does her best to answer any questions her students ask.  She has some really good stories and advice, I would advise against missing lecture days because you can learn so much in such a small span of time.","This class is the highlight of my Freshman year. In the lab, you look at the basics session and do the homework having little clue what the mathematics is, but after attending the class session by Prof. Kutzarova, you come out having a clear idea how to solve a given problem using both the traditional and mathematica methods. She gives good advice","Denka is a nice teacher, but her teaching is extremely confusing and you'll walk out of most lectures more confused than you were when you walked in. However, her tests are straightforward (just memorization) though VERY comprehensive. Learn every side-detail she puts up there [mathematica course]",This is the first professor whom i felt like actually cared for me to understand the grade i got. The course is challenging but not difficult and she goes over your exam with you so you can know it better and learn from your mistakes. Definitely take a course from her.,"Almost no outside of class work. The professor is very helpful, and tells hilarious stories. She also knows alot of incomprehensible information about rocket science.",I had Denka for Diff Eq.  She is an extremely nice woman and is actually quite funny.  She is really helpful in class and gives really good lecture notes.  The tests are pretty easy and are graded really fair.

Also, there was no final!",This class is super interesting and Chamara is very nice and helpful. The articles are online and you barely read them so don't spend the $60 on the course packet. She made this class one of my favorites. Grade is made up of one paper(super easy) and a couple of online quizzes. Interesting class and easy A.,Chamara is the TA to take if you're taking EPS 202. She is unbelievably helpful when it comes to tests... Trust me... She also speaks to students as adults and os not afraid to swear in class; it really lightens the mood of an otherwise boring class. She is on her students' side when it comes to just about everything. Great TA.

When our TA didn't give us feedback on a project until the day  before it was due, Dr. Kwast did nothing.",This is a hard class with the level of detail that you need to know. Kwast was good at explaining in detail but he talks really fast and the pace of the class goes fast. I recommend getting the online book from a friend - it's well written and helps clear things up that you may have missed in lecture.,"Kwast gives you practice exams that are extremely similar to the real thing. He is clear about what you need to know.

I was getting around a 50% average on all the practice finals... ended up getting a 28% on the actual final (only curved to a 38).,so hard. don't take it if u can.,"Professor Kwiat is pretty good at explaining things and does cool demos. Exams in the class can be rough, and they move at a really fast pace being half a semester. Overall pretty decent, sometimes can be a little confusing though.",He explains course material clearly and thus makes the tough course relatively easier.,"This is a very fast paced course, and between lectures, labs, and homework, it can be difficult to keep up. Reviewing the lecture notes after class and seeing what you might have missed out in lecture will definitely go a long way to helping someone get a good grade in the class.","Do the homework and prelectures and everything else and you'll have a pretty good buffer for the midterm and final. STUDY YOUR ASS OFF FOR THE EXAMS THEY COUNT FOR A LOT. Kwiat is a awesome though, he gives candy for participation.","He's an amazing lecturer and really cares about teaching Phys 213 and 214. While some lectures are a little dry, its mainly because of the content, not because of him. He does a lot of demos which are really nice.",Amazing professor. Quite possibly the best one I've had at UIUC. He really knows his stuff AND is incredible at teaching. 1010 would take another class with him,stylish bowtie and suspenders,"He was a very nice man but I did not think he was very good at teaching. He's brilliant but lecture was so confusing and he went so quickly. Questions were not answered as thoroughly during lecture but his office hours were good. An incredibly hard class but he tried to make it understandable, it just was not as helpful.","Easy to understand and good at explaining things. Lectures contained lots of experimental work that I didn't care about, making the class a bit less rigorous than I expected.","Just your average professor. Goes over the material incredibly fast.

1549756,2.4,Dharma,Kwon,5,0.4637315632819149,This professor is funny even when he doesn't mean to be funny. His best trait is teaching material and then giving you homework that actually corresponds to what he actually taught. It can get confusing sometimes because sometimes you don't know what the terms mean; but at least you know how to reliably get to the result.,"Good class.

It is also pretty interesting and Kwon is a good teacher. It can appear like a lot of the material is from a pretty narrow perspective, but it's not anything forced. You do need to go to every discussion and most lectures. You can get As guaranteed on the exams because you can write down the solutions ahead of time.","The class is pretty easy but 20 pages of reading each week and attendance is enforced via in-class assignments. She also comes off a bit obnoxious, calling out people for sleeping or not paying attention in her class instead of making it interesting.

Interesting subject (Asian American Youth). Will tell you the class is very ""intensive"" but very easy to get an A. Lots of extra credit offered too.",Really really stuck up professor. I'd add profanities to describe her but it might get deleted. Class isn't bad at all and the TA'S are nice but this professor forces you to go to class by making pop quizzes and getting upset about everything. Treats you like you are in grade school and pretty useless lectures.,No Comments,"the class is easy, however, she assigns pop quizzes so lecture is mandatory. not really a problem. except for the fact that she gives pop ""attendance"" quizzes in the last five minutes of class. so even if you attend every class, if you leave 5 min early to get to your next class on time, you will fail the pop quizzes."

Did not think i'd like thermo, but he made it interesting and was really good at explaining","I was dreading Thermodynamics before taking his class. It was my favorite class this semester. He explains clearly, is endlessly patient, has a great sense of humor, learns everyone's names, and he's super Greek. One of the most effective professor's I've seen. Definitely worth the 8:00 AMs.","I just left his last lecture. I find (well, found) thermodynamics very tedious and boring in previous classes. But it was impossible not to love his class.

You need to put in the work to get a good grade, but the class is set up to help you succeed.",Highly recommended. I went out of my way to take a second class with him. He made a difficult and math-heavy subject understandable. Office hours were very helpful and sometimes necessary to complete homework. Only bad thing is he talks REALLY loud. Ultimately a small price to pay for one of the best engineering profs on campus.,Best prof ever!,"I would go out of my way to take another class with Kyritsis.

The subject matter however was far more difficult this time around.  Office hours were needed very much.

She had to remove some course content to 'catch up' to where we were supposed to be. She tends to make a lot of mistakes while deriving things on the board [which i practically all that happens in lectures] and as implied before, moves awfully slow."
2068844,2.6,Kris,Lambert,3,0.3296473975093516,"Kris's class was fun, it was a small class so it was easy to get side tracked by asking questions. Which helped us learn. Grade is given by 5 quizzes, which I did not find easy. Using common nematode names on quizzes and not providing them on the slides to be used to study did not help the quizzes to go any better. Answers are NOT on Google, either","He would not stop talking about nematodes. Even when we were not covering them. He reads directly from the lecture slides that he did not even create, some other professor did, and he was bumbling along with them. All of the test questions were definitely from some other lectures because most of the things that were asked were not in his lectures.","The class was so very boring. I only said it was hard because you *have* to go to class. If you do not go to class  you will fail, which, considering the topic, is kind of silly. I could have easily stayed home and done all the assignments they forced us to do in-class and gotten a good grade. Basically, go to class, get an A. That simple."

Great at simplifying /explaining over complicated sounding assignments,very lenient and understanding of circumstances,Haydn is a wonderful TA! He is very understanding and always available outside of class. He gives great feedback on assessments and overall is very lenient. Highly recommend to take his class if possible.,"Haydn is a really considerate and resourceful educator. We learn about how to be effective educators, but he actually practices what he preaches! Really awesome person, he gives detailed feedback and is really reasonable. Just maintain strong and clear communication!!!","Haydn was very respectful, caring, mindful, and understanding of our demands as students and helped us through the semester. He made sure each of us individually understood the material and cared more about our learning than the grade we received, which lessened the stress each of us felt for this course.",Great TA,"Very fair grader, engaging and easy to follow, really good guy!","Hayden is the best and really sweet. Always there for students and open to assignment extensions!!! Super easy and fun class, Hayden even showed us a funny dog video once- he's a real gem!!","Haydn has been my favorite teacher I have had at this school so far. He is so understanding and willing to work with your schedule, he cares about all the students, he is willing to answer any questions whether that is in class or via email and he made this class so enjoyable. I am so happy I had him.",He is a very caring and professional TA. He gives good feedback on assignments and always gives you a chance to improve on past assignments. Would strongly recommend him.

The PPT and in class examples are not conclusive and most of the time you have to find TA office hours for the homework problems.  The exams are usually taken from the homework, so I believe it is easy to pass. But I don't think this class is useful to my career.","Great professor. Structures is difficult to make exciting and interesting but if you have a genuine interest in learning, he will do everything he can to help you out.",Bad,"The lecture notes are great. But you won't pass the course on those alone. The homework is long (get comfy with 2 am SunR nights), and oddly worded. The office hours (for both prof and TA) are must haves for truly understanding the material. This course is static deformable bodies,  you need it for the fun stuff. Exams are slightly above HW.","I appreciated the powerpoints, but they weren't always clear. Examples were very simple, homework got ridiculously long and complicated.

Terrible!,"Most boring lectures. Toughest grader I know, and it seems like he doesnt care at all about his student's success. DONT take this class","Lectures are just him reading off the powerpoint or rambling on tangents that won't be on the test. Classes can feel long and dull, and all slides are posted anyway. Only grades in the class are four tests - which can be very hard and specific. The class is manageable to get through though.",WE STAN JOHN LAMMERS,"The class itself is interesting, but the professor lectures at you more than leading a discussion. Students are rarely asked to participate other than during fishbowl discussions before the test. The lectures do tend to drag on but the class itself is fairly easy. Pretty much no homework and his tests are exactly like the study guides.","iClicker questions once per week on the reading were actually pretty hard. Huge midterm paper and I didn't even understand what it was on exactly because he is very smart and doesn't explain things on a level for undergraduates to comprehend. Concepts are very hard to wrap your head around. He's a very nice professor, but just not for this class.","Prof Lammers is an amazing teacher. Granted he expects you to read a lot of material, but he gives all of it to you. It also helps that his lectures are great at summarizing the information as well as expanding upon it in a way that is easily understandable. He has 1 paper and 1 test as well as participation and daily quizzes, very fair grader.",Fantastic professor! Class is enjoyable and knowledge is applicable. Dr. Lammers is very helpful too.,"I thought this class was pretty interesting because I am very interested in the United States healthcare system. However, this professor gets sidetracked quite frequently making class drag on forever. He doesn't get straight to the point during lectures. His exams were very easy to prepare for and well written though.","If you skim the readings and are a warm body in his classroom, you'll easily ace this class.","This class is very beneficial if you really want to get to know the US health industry. It is very practical for people who want to enter the health field. The exam was pretty easy, since he gave you a study guide and tells you exact what will be on the exam. The exam is usually consist of 40 multiple choice question and a short essay question","I had to say the class was pretty boring, the class consist reading every single day, and we often have iclicker quiz on the reading material. There is also a midterm paper 10~15 pages which counts a large portion of your grade, also the is a in class midterm on the macdonlalization ritzler book. However, he is a very easy grader to his student.","He is a great guy and, his lectures are semi-interesting. He tends to get off topic often.

Great guy with a nice sense of humor.",Explains concepts fairly well. Exams and grading are fair,Humorous guy. His exam is ridculously hard. But he curves everyone during the finals. I like him regardless,"Pretty easy homework and material, but his teaching is lacking, probably due to the blandness of the subject matter. He doesn't really tell you how to actually DO the problems, so work to figure that out on your own. I had a very helpful TA so that was very nice. Seems nice, but also inapproachable.","Seems like he's never prepared... He brings in a couple of pages of notes he uses but everything he teaches are exactly out of the textbook. If you hope to take useful notes in this class, just loss that hope now. His writing is everywhere. Extremely upset with his teaching style. Would NOT recommend...","Professor LaNave was pretty good, there were times when the lectures got a bit confusing, but if you read the chapters, you would understand what was going on.  The homework was never too much and the exams were exactly like the mock exams.  I highly recommend taking a class with him."

You must go to a 2 hour discussion and hour lecture. We talk about not being prejudice, but  she and her TAs are. Kinda anti white.

Professor Lang is charismatic, funny and definitely a chili.","Very knowledgeable and (more importantly) passionate about the subject. Don't take the course if you want an easy grade? he wants everyone to work a bit. At the same time, he is a charismatic and responsive lecturer, so you will get a lot out of the material.",The open discussions stimulate great conversations. There is one paper due each week as a combination of a reflection and analysis of the readings for that week. Those papers are especially helpful for discussions. No tests. Lang is extremely knowledgeable and a great professor.,Very cool and easy going. Class is centered around participation and he challenges your viewpoints. There is A LOT of reading and writing (3 page essays a week across 9 books). Hard work outside but it pays off in class and in the end.,"his pop quizzes are unbelievably hard, but he grades papers very easily"

He's a decent lecturer, but I disliked all of his pre-made power points that we not very descriptive. He was not so great at answering questions, but he is overall a nice guy and the class was definitely easy.","His lectures for this pass/fail lecture series were only ok, but how can I give less than a perfect score to Mr. Wizard?",Lange knows his material and has the ability to relate his knowledge clearly to students. He takes time to review previous concepts the class finds difficult.,"He is a great teacher.  He seems like to teach his stuff.  One bad point of him would be only that he would be hard to connect with.  He only likes a person who understand everything about his material which most student can't fulfill.  Besides that, he's materials are pretty easy and it's all in the book.","Lange is a decent professor teaching a horrid little class. As a civil engineer it sure feels bad when your first real civil class is about accounting and what look like logic tables. I suppose Lange did his best, but like many UIUC professors he expected students to digest way too much info, way too fast leading to poor learning.","Very boring lectures, but it is a class where you go, you pass.","Even though lectures were a little boring, he was extremely helpful and occasionally he was a little entertaining!

He likes to joke around and really likes answering questions. This was one of the most enjoyable classes ever. Make sure you do the study guide!","Dustin is awesome.  He went over slides in a manner where he got straight to the point, didn't spend 15 mins a slide, so we would get out early a lot.  Would tell you mid class... YOU NEED TO KNOW THIS, so the tests were as straight forward as possible. take this class it's interesting.","Very straightforward class. Attendance and participation were worth 25% total. 3 exams, 25% each. Basically, go to class and go through the study guide and study the slides and you'll be fine.

Really good explanations that make him really easy to understand. You MUST read though. If you don't read the book or at least take notes you will do bad. His tests are very unforgiving but he is a bit lenient when it comes to final grades.,He is a very nice and funny guy and makes class fun.  He expects you to read before each class so you can discuss the book cases.  Tests are kind of hard so make sure you study.,"Very, very nice guy, though not as easy of a class as Kindt's. M-T (33%) is all T-F, Final (67%) is T-F and M/C, but he tests small details in addition to bigger concepts. Overall I'd recommend him.","Agreed - guy talked about his world travels (which were genuinely interesting) most of the time. It's an interesting class because of his stories, but there's no way to get an A unless you read the text cover-to-cover and audiotape all classes... and then just maybe an A. Otherwise, go to class and take notes -- easy B.","Are you guys crazy? This guy was a jerk. He couldn't care one bit about the grade you got, and was more interested in tells us about his many travels around the world and the work he did at his big law firm that let us in on a little secret we in the educational world like to call a grading scale.

Very good choice for rhet 105!",She rocks. Loved her. She took a super boring class and made it interesting and is always looking to accommodate you.

There are assignments, but not an overwhelming amount and she is flexible most of all. Take BTW250 with her if you can!","Though she was occasionally scatterbrained, I very  much enjoyed my class with her.

She is very enthusiastic and you can talk to her about everything.,"She was talking to our class about how she only has one review and I thought I'd give her one. She is great everyone seriously.

When she was in the classroom, she cut students off when they were talking in discussions. She doesn't answer questions very clearly. I also got the impression that she did not respect her main TA and was often rude to him in front of students.","I found her pretty irritating. She calls out and praises the same 10 students in a class of 60 and tries to create a ""life-changing"" experience through her class that just doesn't happen. Lecture is really boring save for videos. The papers are annoying but there are only a few. However, she grades easy enough and the class itself isn't hard.","The thing that really bugged me about this class is how slanted it is. It is so one sided and Tara, I found, favored the students who reflected her beliefs. It got so frustrating because of her intolerance (which is ironic, given we've been taught to be tolerant to everyone and everything) of opposing beliefs and avoiding diversity of opinions.","Tara is a control freak. She DEMANDS that this class is transformative and builds it into the curriculum. If you do not have an amazing experience with her, it will affect your grade. Her class feels 3x as long as it actually is. Don't let her turn you off of social work though if you're taking this class to see if you like the major.","Really disliked teacher and class. Text is terrible, topics are boring and self-explanitory. Piles on homework that I didn't find helpful. Thinks pretty highly of herself and sometimes evades answering questions.","LOVED TARA! she does a great job with this class. she really tries to engage her students and does everything she can to make class fun. she's really understanding, but her midterm was really hard. overall i would totally recommend this class to anyone. only 6 homeworks all semester!! and one project worth 70% of grade but she loves anything you do",Overall Great Teacher!!!,"Wonderful class, wonderful professor. Professor Larrison is the most helpful and understanding prof. I've had so far; makes a great effort to know her students and to include them as much as possible in the course material.

The class is pretty tough if you've never taken a stats class before. Attendance is graded as well.,"He is the nicest and the most caring professor you'll ever have. Always open to any questions and provides excellent feedback. The course is pretty dry and has a lot of statistics, so be ready to spend some time. Study from his slides. Only two tests a semester and a couple of projects. Go to class for participation points.","Professor Eric is outstanding and cares about each and every one of his students. He's always open to questions or conversations after class.

It was basically a statistics class, that was very math heave. There are no tests except a midterm and a final. Homework is only like every 3 weeks, and is kind of time consuming.

Soft spoken, and wants to see you learn and be better. He tries to make it interesting, but the content is pretty dry. It was difficult to learn the content because it was a little sloppy since it is a ""pilot"" course. Not a lot of homework and only 2 exams, just go to class.","Professor Larson is literally the sweetest and most kind teacher you will ever have. Always has a smile on his face and is open to feedback, which is great since this is the first year the class was taught.

Could tell he actually enjoyed teaching. Fast-paced but organized well and not really overwhelming.  If you show up to lecture and do the HW and practice exams that are put up, you should do fine on the exams, which were pretty straight-forward.  Cool New Zealand accent also!","GO TO CLASS(even though its fast paced). I got overconfident by acing the first two midterms, since it was all stuff I did in high school ap calc ab, and then I stopped going to class. By the third midterm, I did very poorly so much so that despite getting high A's in 2 exams AND the final, I ended with an 88(which was curved up to an A-)","A very challenging class. I left lectures without a clue what just went on, because I was too busy copying down the fast-paced notes and examples. I spent ~5 hours per homework and made it out with a B.

Reading the textbook outside of class helped me a lot, because it gave some explanation behind all of the examples worked in class.",Great all around professor. One of my all time favorites. Fun accent and even he seems to really enjoy himself during class. Highly recommended.,Absolutely Great Professor!!  Work hard and you will succeed with his help.  First college math class was success. A+,"awesome professor, just too much course work.","Awesome professor. Very enthusiastic, easy to see he actually enjoys teaching and wants his students to succeed.",He is an awesome professor.  The class is hard but he is really good at explaining it.  He goes really quickly but really knows his stuff.  Always stays back after class for people to ask questions and is very open to students sugesstions,"Coolest accent ever. He's usually pretty funny and he's a pretty good lecturer. His tests are fair, but the class is relatively hard, especially if it's your very first college math class.","Very helpful and intelligent. Alot of students hate b/c they go into office hours expecting him to spoon feed them the answers like they are used to. Instead, he leads students to deriving the answers on their own. I like to compare him to a good spot at the gym. Agood spot will help you just barely enough for you to succeed, stimulating the muscle","He handled a difficult subject fairly well... lectures very clearly and understandably, but very quickly, and expects you to keep up.  Kind of hard to reach at his office sometimes.  Exams were all open book open notes, and in-class exercises were numerous and mostly useful.",Was very good at explaining the ideas in detail as well as summing them up in non-rigorous but understandable ways.  Hard but good class.

Close to no homework, but a few take home assignments that are finished quickly if you attended lecture. TAKE HER CLASS! AND SHE'S HOT.","Professor Laurence is a great teacher and I really enjoyed her class. Ignore the syllabus, you don't need to do the readings. The textbook just comes in handy for writing papers. Her one downfall is she is a very unfair grader. She will take points off for things that don't deserve it. But other than that a very fun and enthusiastic professor","Karen Laurence is one of the most enthusiastic professors I've had. She goes in depth during the lectures (go to them if you want to get an A) and makes the material interesting and easy to make sense of. If you can take a class with her, do it; you'll be in for a treat. Lots of books for the class, but you really only use one of them.",Professor Laurence is awesome. she is soo nice and is really interested in what she teaches. she's very down to earth and quite entertaining. The tests are pretty fair if you study hard and she does offer extra credit if you need an extra boost at the end of the semester. best professor I've had so far at U of I. I highly recommend her classes!,Professor Laurence is amazing. One of the best. She has a great interest in the topic which engages you on what can be a boring topic (Ancient Greece).

He is very good at presenting the material, and is always open to explaining things that do not make sense, or persuing anything that the class is interested in that pertains to the topic in lecture. The homework assignments are quite  challenging, and are not busy work.","If he's teaching a course, take it. CS 373 is usually supposed to be boring and hard.

She emphasizes knowing Matlab and did not realize most of the class had little experience with it. Overall if you put in the effort and participate in class you will know what to do for the exams.,"Probably one of the least organized classes I've ever taken. Nobody know what to study for tests because she tells you nothing, and you can't even check your grades anywhere online. 20% of the grade also depends on ""class participation"", which isn't attendance, but what she thought you did to participate outside of just going to lecture."

I love his dimples.,Mark is so funny and a really nice guy.  Too bad he's married.,"Mark is cool as heck. He knows what he wants from his students and when he feels that he's gotten that, everybody's happy and we can all go home. He's not one to fill up the class time with clutter. He has an agenda, and when it's done, we're done. He also has a realistic grasp on grading. He knows what he wants and communicates that clearly.",Best instructor ever. Interesting class. None of his classes were boring. Easy to understand and also is a fair grader. Best class for cmn101,"Awesome guy, understands the college student and doesnt expect one to be only focused on that class.

It was an easy class but was pretty heavy with busy work for a gen ed.,"Makes sure to cover the important points in lecture but likes to go on long tangents and can get kind of boring at times. He has weekly reading quizzes which aren't that difficult even if you skip lecture, just have to skim the slides for main ideas. There are a couple papers and two exams(both online), not too bad if you want to knock out a req.",Teach this man how to use a microphone,"I really enjoyed Professor Layton. His class was very reading heavy but it was alright because I really did learn a lot. He is obviously very passionate and knowledgeable about what he teaches. He does a good job at asking good, critical thinking type questions both in lecture and on exams. Take this class if you're looking for a fun challenge.","Layton was alright. I wouldn't say he is a good prof/lecturer but he wasn't as bad as others I have had. A fair warning though, this man -preaches-. He doesn't lecture like a normal person; when you are in his course you will feel like you're at the local baptist church listening to a sermon. If you can get past that it's okay. 4/10.","Layton is pretty hard to follow during lectures. He is very boring. There are weekly quizzes in TA sections and if you get a good TA, they're not too bad. Reading assignments are very, very heavy but you won't die if you don't read. The exams are online so it's not too bad. I wouldn't recommend taking this if you're not interested in religions.","Layton really cares about what he is teaching.  however, you won't get an easy A.  There's a lot of material, and the tests are worth 30% of the grade.  The final is noncumulative, but the course is heavily weighted on exams.  He does give study guides which is helpful though.  A great professor, and you'll learn some great things about the Bible.","Layton is very passionate about what he teaches and makes very clear what he wants for exams. The material makes it a lot harder than the standard 100 class. You must keep up on all readings/lectures, but he's always willing to help you outside of class. Don't take him if you want an easy A; take him if you want a rigorous and stimulating class.","I agree with the other reviewer, this class is an easy B but it's an incredibly difficult A. The weekly pop quizzes are graded harshly, meaning you have to constantly be up to date on all of the readings. Despite finding the subject interesting, it was hard to stay focused through the lecture. 13 of the students in the room were usually asleep.","This was a very interesting course, and Layton has a very strong command of material. Readings are long, and the topic matters are complex to say the least. But he is super helpful, and is there to see the success and learning of the class. Attendance isn't mandatory, but the class would be pointless without it. An easy B, but an A is tough.",Layton is clearly passionate about this topic. Lectures are easy to follow and quizzes (usually every friday) are extremely easy. Decent grader and Exams were easy,"I really don't know why he others have been calling him difficult or unclear. In my opinion, Layton is very clear, excited about what he teaches, and loves to pose thought-provoking questions. As someone who is not religious, his non-religious analysis of the Bible is very helpful and he's super approachable. Take a class with him if you can!","Weekly quizzes, 2 papers, midterm and final. Extremely difficult to pay attention to in lecture. Very cryptic teaching style. Tests are intense-- take forever to prepare for, but are straightforward if you put forth the time. If you're a solid Christian it will drive you crazy. His theology is very odd.","Great class - learned a lot, and Professor Layton's teaching style made the lecture seem smaller. While this advice may seem obvious, speak up in class and use the study guides!","I really enjoyed this class. I actually anticipated it to be harder than it actually was. Be prepared for a lot of reading, which is understandable for this type of class. Dr. Layton is very knowledgable and easy to approach for questions. I recommend taking this class!","This class was pretty difficult. The grading was tough and the material was not that easy to understand, especially if you don't have a prior knowledge or background about the Bible. The professor however is nice and knows a lot about what he teaches and is willing to help you out. Not an easy gen-ed...","Best professor I've ever had. If you want to actually learn something, take a course by Layton. Don't take his courses if you're looking for blow off classes. They are pretty demanding.",awesome!,"He was an awesome professor! He knew what he was talking about, was funny, and was really interested in the subject which made it easier to learn. There is hardly any assignments, 3 papers,2 midterms and everything is done on powerpoint, which he posts online, but i would recommend going to lecture because he explains it in more depth.",Professor Layton is one of the best professors I have had. He is really knowledgeable. The class seemed like more work than I expected for a 101 course but I do not regret taking it. It was really interesting. Although attendance is not mandatory we did have quizzes. I would recommend this course if you are willing to work. Notes are posted online.

There are no explanations nor any followup discussions apart from the ones she prepares beforehand.,She is clear and consistent with her lectures. Materials are interesting.,Excellent preparation and time management. She is a very sincere professor and the best I've ever had.,Quite a poor professor. She has interesting research but has no clue how to properly lecture. Slides are verbatim from the book as are the exams. Does not help at office hours and has a terrible laugh.

149869,2.6,James,Leake,57,0.25766137496494645,"He makes you buy his book, which was so not worth money and he is also a VERY boring lecturer. I mean, it is almost mind-numbingly boring. He has a very monotonic voice and is passionate about the subject, but not in a way that makes people want to listen to what he is saying. He is very nice though, and when I talked to him alone, he was helpful.","He isn't the most interesting lecturer, but he knows his stuff and is willing to answer questions. Attendance is taken via a sign-in sheet that you initial. There isn't too much work in the class at first but as time goes on work intensifies, culminating in the design project which takes hours and hours of work. He will help you, though.","His lectures are kinda boring and he speaks with a monotone voice. He knows his stuff, but the delivery is not so good. He wrote the textbook so everything can be found in there. The modeling assignments are pretty easy, the sketching assignments are not hard, but time consuming. Start the group project early!!!!",This class is extremely tedious and time consuming. It's only offered for 3 credit hours which is far less than what it should be. The TAs can be pretty helpful but Leake's lectures are extremely long and boring. It's hard not to fall asleep unless you're very interested in the subject. Be prepared to do a lot of tedious work.,"Guys, start the design project early if you're in CEE.  As far as Leake, he knows his stuff, but the delivery is pretty boring and he isn't nearly as involved as he should be.","If you can get past the boring delivery, he actually explains the material pretty well.  Start the design project early.  On the last week, I spent 4-5 hours a few days in a row fixing parts and working on the assembly.  Exams are relatively easy, but you do have to know the material well enough to be able to work quickly",You're most likely taking this class a requirement and there's no avoiding Leake. Therefore just accept the facts of the class: There are frequent sketching assignments that are graded hard but if you put in effort they are fine. Then the tests are taken directly from his book so if you study it exactly the few nights before you should be fine.,"If you have to take the class, make sure you pay attention to your assignments posted on Compass. The design project will take up a huge chunk of your time, so make sure you know what you need to do ahead of time. Lectures are boring, hopefully you get a good TA as they end up being the people who grade everything and can help you on modeling.","He has repeatedly cancelled assignments, then at the last minute required it again. We were tested on material we were not taught nor told we had to know it. Points were taken off assignments if we didn't write our name in all caps. When our TA was asked if the information was even useful, he said no. Also we had to the useless textbook he wrote.","This class is not really helpful. I am not going to lie, I did enjoy learning how to use Autodesk Inventor but the sketching stuff was pointless. Not only did they hurt my grade but I never need to use it in my life. This class was not worth all the hours i put in. Also the prof. is really boring. His lectures are pointless and his tests are hard.","Most boring lectures ever. But, if you take notes it will help out in the long run. Also, read the texts.",he sucks at teaching! and he hates his students! extremely boring lecture and tons of assignments dues every week and he never teach.,"Easily the most ineffective professor I've had at UIUC. His lectures provide no insight into the material, or the slightest notion of enthusiasm. The majority of this class is taught by the TAs who struggle to keep up with his disorganized scheduling and thought processes. Do yourself a big favor and start the design project ASAP.","Leake is a sad man.  He hates his job and he hates teaching, that much is obvious.  #1 problem with the class is lack of organization and scheduling.  Due dates are revealed a few days before the date (even on major assignments), directions are cryptic and sometimes irrelevant.  Just get your project moded ASAP because it WILL be due unexpectedly!!","Boring lecture, no denying that. Interesting course material. Good ONLY if you like spatial visualization.",He didn't keep anyone interested in the material. He was very boring. The written exams definitely weren't easy either. A lot of work required for the class as well.,"This class is extremely boring. I am a CEE major and this class has nothing to do with my major. This is completely useless. Not to mention his monotone, dull and boring voice.","I had his lecture at 10 and still fell asleep in class. I had to go since he took attendance. Exams are heavily dependent on the tedious textbook he wrote. I still remember how the book said an advantage of using a mechanical pencil is the fact that you don't have to sharpen it. Also, it advised to use an eraser that won't smudge. Still, an easy A.","More than half of the students in lecture are either not paying attention or sleeping, but he has no one to blame but himself. He is lazy, boring, and doesn't seem to care about the students understanding of the material. It is not a terribly hard class, but it's certainly not an enjoyable one.","Very,very boring. This class is hard if you do not have good visualization skills. Lectures are pointless to go to. Get started early on the design project even tho I know you won't.

It is a shame because the class content could be really fun and interesting, but his dry character sucks all of that enthusiasm right out of the course. He spends half of each lecture explaining what he is going to talk about during lecture, aight? Not good.",I have never worked harder at a 100 level class in my life. Lectures are mandatory and you will fall asleep due to the dry monotone that persists for 50 minutes.,"No question, he is boring. However, if you go to class, and study hard for exams and learn autocad stuff,you should be fine.

He can't teach.,"What did UIUC expect when they made a course that combined 3D Auto CAD, Inventor, hand sketching, learning about perspective and a bad professor who runs a racket selling his textbook to the class every semester? Clearly it is not working, because they try to teach you too much and not much sticks.","Very Boring.  Does not teach the class well at all.  Avoid taking the class at all costs.  It is extremely boring and requires a lot of work.  Plus, most of his TAs can't speak English.","I think he's a robot.

Although I had a very difficult time obtaining my grades I believe this class was  worth it in the long run to help me succeed at UIUC owing to the analytical skills I have obtained during the class.,"No, he's not easy.  Not sure what the last guy is talking about.  It's a tough class and it's very analytical of the text, but the class will definitely help you understand how to critically examine literature.  He's also one of the most intelligent profs I've ever had.",This guy has no clue what he's doing and the class is the biggest waste of time ever. It is ridiculously easy to get an A as long as you show up to all of the classes.

He gives hand outs which summarize everything in the book in a comprehensible manner. His English is also very good and he does a good job at making sure the class can follow along. I wish he taught every math class here.","Great lecturer with excellent board technique. Nice handouts with notes. Accent not a problem, as he teaches the math better than most native English speakers. Would certainly take another class with him.","Matrices did not seem like a something I would enjoy, but Prof. Lee proved me wrong. He is a great professor. Even the hard material was easier to comprehend with the way he taught it! If he teaches another class I will for sure take it!"

It was fairly easy to get a good grade as long as you showed up every class and paid attention to the lecture. Most of the students got B+, and A. The lab was very very interesting, and TAs were extremely helpful.","The course material wasn't easy, but he made it doable. Very clearer, and knowledgeable. Fair exams and he graded pretty easy.

She assignes A LOT of reading as well. It's a hard class, but I could see how someone might like it.  I think it's very dependent on your interests.","I'm not a fan of Jean. It is the end of the semester and we have not gotten any grades back yet. Very slow to grade, comments are not helpful and extremely confusing. She is really nice during class though, but overall not worth it. Take a different TA if at all possible.","She constantly says ""FABULOUS!"" The class itself is so easy. You have one textbook. For each class you get assigned three poems to read, but you can get away with not reading them. There are a couple writing assignments but nothing horrible. A really easy grade with not a lot of effort. She only thinks she is correct.",JEAN IS *FABULOUS*! FABULOUS I TELL YOU!,Most of the time I have no idea what she's talking about because she's off on a separate tangent. Written comments on essays are indecipherable and rarely helpful. This was the class that made me regret not attempting the AP English test in high school. Avoid this professor if possible.,"She's very nice and very willing to help you out. Also, she is very interesting and is able to interpret boring rhetoric concepts with good examples. Generous on grade!","I loved Jean so much. She helps you understand how to write in an academic setting and the standards that you'll encounter when writing during college. We did do like four drafts for every paper which got tiring and the peer reviews were useless, but other than that she was fabulous."

Worst professor ever in my life.",Pretty interesting stuff for the second half of class. He's not a hard grader so just make sure to get things in on time. Neither textbook is necessary to do well in the class.,"He's an easy grader, and was helpful during office hours. Thinks (and says) it's all your fault if you don't do well, even when his study guides were awful. Lectures can get boring sometimes. Group projects and exams took a big part of grades. I did learn a lot from the class, but it could have been designed differently. Overall not too bad.","Prof. Lee is very friendly and helpful. He always makes sure that all the students understand the material given after class. What he explains in the class are very useful for the exam, so take notes. His slides are very informative too.","Professor Lee is a very friendly and knowledgeable teacher. He may be unclear at times, but he is extremely approachable. With that being said, Professor Lee is open to helping students out. You should have a basic knowledge of statistics for the course.

He posts PPT slides and during lecture he explains each properly.  If you attend the class everyday and show him you are participating, you will get letter grade bonus. (not sure how much.... but you will get some bonus)",Concept explication is a big focus of this course.,"Professor Lee is a very nice guy, he is very interested on the things he teach. The class itself is easy. There are total of three exam and a 5 page research paper. He give study guides before every exam, and goes all over it. All the answers are give in powerpoint slides.

1880233,2.4,Yu-Ching,Lee,4,0.30889642138947887,"She's kind of a disaster in terms of running a course. Usually doesn't do more than read off her slides, which are very detailed (and posted online) so attendance feels not optional. BUT exactly five lectures count for attendance credit, so if you miss one of them you lose 1% of your total grade. So show up, but don't bother paying attention.",Patient and helpful,The absolute worst professor I've ever had at U of I. She literally reads off the lecture slides and sometimes confuses herself with her own notes. Going to class is useless unless there's in in class assignment (counts for attendance). Always shows up late to class and her exam seating protocol is time consuming and pointless. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!,"horrible! JUST HORRIBLE. The worse instructor ever. Pretty much just read her slide without any further discussion. The assignment is so long and difficult as hell. I can assure you that you won't learn a damn thing from her class.

1901574,3.2,Tonghun,Lee,17,0.4426231011064468,"Contrary to popular belief, the quizzes and exams are very fundamental. Problems break down to simple concepts. He actually spends too much time re-explaining concepts to those who don't understand. If you know the material this is an easy class to get an A in. Don't skip class.","Honetly the guy isn't taking his job seriously. The reputation of this program is at stake since the guy just doesn't teach, and this course is crucial for MechE's. I didn't find the class easy since you basically need to learn an entire course on your own. I would avoid him and go for any other professor if i go back in time, I learned nothing.",Lee tells us what the main concepts will be on the exams. Cannot stress it more. His lectures are very inspiring and exams very clear.,"He is an OK professor. His TA does a better job teaching. Reading the book is necessary because most of the time he will be talking about the industrial revolution during lectures, which does not prepare you for the tests and quizzes.","Had him for ME 300. Some days he would teach like normal, but there would be many lectures where he would go off for tangents the entire time and we wouldn't learn anything. Homework was graded for completion. Not great, but not horrible either. Take thermo with someone else if you want to get a really god understanding of the subject.","Attending lectures was a complete waste of time. If you want an easy A then Lee is perfect. If you want to be challenged and get the most out of thermodynamics then do not take Lee. Remember, you're paying to learn from the best and not for an easy A. Get the most out of your money and take thermo somewhere else or with a different instructor.",Didn't find the material hugely interesting but was very easy to determine important and unimportant material. Lee was very clear on what he found important to know and what would appear on assignments. 2 Quizzes (10% each) that just needed basic understanding of material for full credit. HW graded for effort and final generously curved (55% avg.),"Tonghun is different than most teachers. He lectures in his own free form style and doesn't teach out the of the book (you'll need to read it anyway). He repeats himself and goes on tangents a lot but lectures are interesting. The course has two very easy quizzes, difficult hw, and a final worth 45%. The final is brutal but he curves it generously.",Tonghun really is the best professor I know. His ME300 is the only class I won't fall asleep in for a whole semester up to this point. I even made a advisor change request to make him my advisor this semester. His personal charisma reflects clearly in his interesting and energetic lectures. Exams aren't hard once you understand the concepts.,"Tonghun is an interesting teacher, in that he doesn't teach right out of a book. His method is pretty much discussing thermodynamic concepts, helping you understand the theory - but not really helping you solve problems. For that, you need to crack open the textbook and do his weekly, non-graded homework's. Other than that, he's funny and smart.","Mildly difficult homework and tests, but there's a massive curve. He's hilarious and is pretty okay at teaching thermo. Would definitely recommend over any other 300 professor.","He is extremely knowledgeable about thermodynamics, as it is his research area.  He is good at explaining concepts and general topics during the lecture, but working through the homework (for completion, solutions given next week) is core to being able to do problems.  His examples and mannerisms are very amusing.","Cool guy.   Judging from comments by people who took this class in the past years (Lee has only been teaching it 2 semesters), it's always been a bad time. Class lacks an overall organization, you're never really sure what you're supposed to be learning.  I skipped class a bunch and crammed all the hw before the exams. Got a 72%, which was a B.","Prof. Lee is a really cool guy, pretty sociable.  In class he is a little hard to understand at the beginning, but you learn his technique quickly.  He has somewhat difficult HW and midterms, but don't let that fool you.  The final, which is worth 50% tests you on the basics, and is easy.  He curves to B. I've heard that his office hours are rough.",The lesser of two evils. He's not a good teacher but hes better than the other option for ME 300. I got a 78% in the class but still got an A overall so there's a big curve at the end of the year.,"This professor is awesome. The lecture notes are complete, and he goes over each example with care. The tests are fair. Take this class with him!",horrible. the worst professor i have ever met in UIUC....

Lots of writing, and she's a tough grader.  Doesn't like to give A's.  However, she's easy to catch outside of class, so make sure you have her proofread your stuff.

2354489,2.0,Angela,Lee,1,0.14866795543798056,She was incredibly boring. Reads directly from the power points. It seemed like she hardly knew anything about what was really going on in the class and relied mostly on her TA to explain papers that were assigned. She was of little help if you needed to talk to her before or after class.
2058767,3.6,JiHyung,Lee,5,0.343634211022978,"I enjoyed his class. He really tried to make students understood, and was clear what he expected for us to do for assignments, exams and final projects. Grading was also generous. My only complain is he could speak up a bit more and write larger on the blackboard.","For this semester, the only problem of this class was that it was 8AM class. He gives extra credit for attendance, but his exams are straightforward and uploads all the slides so I don't think it's necessary to go to class, but going to class does help you prepare for exams. It was pretty easy and informative class with no final:)","He seems okay, could've done better with explaining things.","He is a very nice professor, and lecture style is very comfortable to understand. Though attendance is mandatory, he seems to not take it seriously, giving all students 100% attendance points. However, class materials are bit of tough that include possible beyond undergraduate level. However, exam materials are all covered by past quizzes.",Don't take his class.

But I have to admit the quiz and exam are difficult. You'd better get an A in STAT 400. If you take the class in spring, there will be big curve because your classmates are almost undergraduate students.","Kiryung is a great professor. He is good at explaining theorem clearly. However, his quizzes and exams are hard and have great amount. The final grade for A is high which makes this class very difficult. I would say if you want to learn something, Kiryung is a great professor for you. If you just want to get an A, you'd better find someone else.","Regardless of your professor, STAT410 is challenging class in general. You need to put some work and effort on every quizzes and exams. DON'T SKIP this class! Understanding the lecture is critical to pass this class. Although his quizzes and exams are hard, he is very helpful if you go to his office hr.

I would definitely recommend him,"Pretty easy gen-ed course- a lot of reading which i didnt do but would have been helpful.. I didn't try hard and I got a B.. the lectures are boring, but its history...","I really liked him! He is so nice to everybody and is just a genuine good guy. While did tend to sometimes ramble during lecture, he seemed very insightful about all of the topics and he seems to take a great interest in history and teaching his students. I would recommend him!",Pretty boring class you get lost in all that is going on. If you have his for discussion there is a lot more going on you have assignments due every week and there are 2 papers for the semester that arent too bad to do. There is a lot of writing involeved in the exams. Overall he likes to stay on one topic  for too long so some things arent covored,Not helpful in the least unless you are in his discussion section. TA's are overly harsh at grading and course is not history based. It's all just Leff's opinions. Pretty much worthless.,"A brilliant man. He knows everything. Also extremely intimidating. He has this glare, a fear about him that makes you think twice before saying something. His readings are long, and complex, and takes hours. Interesting though. Class discussion is tense, for he can call on you at any time, so come prepared. Accepts no BS.","You can skip lecture and b.s. the exams to end up with a B.  Your grade is made up of 25% participation in discussion section, 2 term papers at 15% each, midterm at 15% and final at 30%. For the exams he gives a list of ids and on the exam he will randomly pair up two ids and make you compare and contrast them and the ""themes"" he makes up in class.",Leff's awesome. You'll never find a more dedicated or genuined professor.,Sweetest man on earth!  I wish he was my grandpa!,"Prof Leff is wonderful- he takes an interest in each and every one of his students. His awareness in history is beyond genius- the man is wickedly intelligent. And he is very friendly and kind. However, his classes require a lot of work. Leff rarely gives out A's, so unless you are providentially gifted, be prepared to take a B or lower.","Prof Leff is a great professor, very thought provoking and likes to involve everyone in discussion. He will teach you to think critically and analyze history on different terms. I learned alot from him. However, he doesn't really give out A's, so unless you are ridiciously gifted, most likely you'll end up with a B or below.","He is by far the most interesting lecturer I have had. He speaks a thousand words per minute and he knows a lot of great stats and quotes. The grading is not as easy as I assumed based on his friendly personality, but it's not ridiculous either",Excellent.,"2 of the best classes I've ever taken. One was lecture based, one discussion. Lots of reading, but its interesting. He's a great guy, and very flexible about due dates. He really knows his stuff. I recommend taking one of his classes just to get to know him as a person, he's that great a guy.",Best teacher i have ever had,"Prof Leff is a funny and informed teacher.  Class is long, but if you read for class, you'll find it easy.  Essay tests are not graded hard but book reports are.  If you don't like your TA, get into another class because it won't be enjoyable otherwise.",Professor Leff is awesome!  I loved taking his class.  I have never seen a teacher care more that his students are learning than Professor Leff.  His excitement of history shines through his teaching and goes right to the students; he goes above and beyon,"Prof. Leff is the BEST Proffessor I've had at this Universty by far.  Class is discussion based, so you won'tnotice if he's disorganized.  He is smart and knowledgeable about the subject and to top it off he is a really good person-- and funny!","I may have stayed awake through one of his lectures this semester.

Only attendance taken is in section allow there was some policy in the syllabus about lecture attendance that was never put into place. The reading can be a decent load.,"I am swamped every semester with classes, work, and several extra-curricular activities. Like most people in undergrad, I feel a lot of anxiety at times because of how much I'm trying to juggle. Carol Leff is a breath of fresh air. Her easy classes, nonexistent attendance policy, and sweetness will NEVER add to your stress. Take her classes. OG!","Awesome professor and a sweet lady as well. Definitely one of the most educational classes I've taken. Tests are pretty easy because she says exactly what will be on them, but she expects high quality answers. She's not afraid to rip apart your term paper, which really helps you improve your writing skills.","This class isn't as easy as you think. i got a really good grade but it takes a lot more work than one thinks. 3 quizes, 2 papers and the final.","Instead of attending this class, I chose to watch Maury and drink PBR for lunch. One time on a whim, I went to class and it happened to be a day where we had a test and I got a B+. She uploads all of the slides anyways. When I did go to class, I browsed Reddit (You better not post this for karma).","Not the most interesting subject for me, yet she is a great Professor. She is kind of quirky and tries to be funny which is really cute because you would not expect that from her. Great help, Syllabus is clear. No surprises. I'm currently in my second class with her. Too bad I am done with PS or I would take more with her.",Love her! She is a knowledgeable teacher. You will have no problem with exams if you study her exam guides well.,"Easy class. Do the study guides because the three quizzes are almost identical to them. Readings are useful only for the papers and essays, so skim them as she assigns them so it is easier later to write the papers. She is very knowledgeable and explains well. Lecture slides are posted and are very thorough. Highly recommended.","Professor Leff tries her best to make her class manageable. She succeeds, but she bores. I hated going to this class, but all you need to do is attend class and study for the three quizzes that she provides you study guides for. Easy 200 level course.","Prof. Leff is disorganized, but if you pay attention and read the handouts, you will understand and most likely enjoy what she teaches. She is passionate about the subjects she teaches. She is always willing to help students, and even gives out research to help you get started on your final paper. Very nice, funny, and interesting.","She is completely disorganized and always seems very frazzled. The class has very little direction, and a lot of times in lecture I am confused as to why she is talking about something. Overall, it is a pretty easy class though.","One of the better and easier professors I've had, very very cognizant of student needs, both exams are 1/2 ID's (given beforehand) and 1/2 take home essay (also given beforehand). Highly recommend Prof. Leff.","awkward.  but super intelligent.  midterm, final, research paper.  study guides for exams.  help with research papers.  little effort for an A","One of the best teachers I have ever had! She is such a sweet and caring person. All of the lectures are online and the quizzes are straight forward. The paper assignments are given beforehand and there are no surprises! In sum, interesting class and wonderful teacher!!!","excellent class to take whether you're in the major or not.  Does a great job of outlining the major points and issues covered.  quizzes and final are all very fair, shouldn't give anybody too much trouble so long as they do the study guides.",Lectures weren't captivating but they weren't boring. Pretty relaxed class. Had to write two papers and had three quizzes and a final. Not a bad gen-ed to take.,"BORING class... do no work and get a B, however it is pretty difficult to get an A. She is very lax in reguards to due dates, perhaps too much","Best professor I've had at U of I. Course material is, by nature, sometimes very dry and lengthy but she makes it interesting and engaging.

Participation is a big part, it's good to be prepared by reading cases before class.","As others have mentioned, he is definitely your best option for 304.  All individual memos are pass/fair and it is almost impossible to fail.  He makes boring information fairly interesting.  Easy A-, tough A.","Justin is one of the best professors available for 304. I highly recommend taking him. Participation and getting a good group are huge. You must go to class and talk every now and then, but he is very engaging, enthusiastic and uses funny examples. The only test grade is a final, which is not very difficult. Take Justin!",He is the best professor to take for this class. He is very helpful and engaging. Participation is a big aspect of the class so attendance is important. There is only one exam for the class which is the final and it is not very tough. I highly recommend Justin!!!!,"For this class you have to complete 10 individual cases and several group assignments.  There is no midterm, only a final.  Getting a good group for this class is essential.  Also make sure to participate since that is also a big portion of your grade.  Leiby is the best teacher to get for this class.",Engaging Professor and one of the best in the college. Personable and he uses examples which are easy to relate to.

In our discussion section we played jeopardy with exact questions from the exam too. A lot of questions are from the textbooks so reading is important. Overall the class was easy if you put in the time.,You will need both of the required books along with attending class regularly. Exams are based on lecture notes and both books. Chapters are long. Extra credit options are available and a few essays outside of class are required. The exam wording is weird.,"Instead of using an Iclicker, he made us purchase software called TopHat. Jokes on him, you don't need to go to class. You can access it online from home and get participation points by answering questions. The lectures are pretty boring.

His office hours were invaluable as he was able to provide both geometric and analytic interpretations of the course theorems. Would recommend reading the textbook.","I really liked Prof. Leininger. He is really, really funny, engaging and makes the lectures somewhat interesting (there is only so much he can do to make calculus interesting). He is also very kind and always willing to help outside of class and also after class. I definitely really liked him and would take his class again.","Leininger is a great teacher. He cares about his students! He posted our lectures online and lecture notes occasionally online as well. He gave out review sheets for exams and pulled no tricks.

I would take any class by him again if I could 10/10 would recommend.","Tough class, one of the easier professors. Posts lecture videos and notes online.","Clear lectures for the most part. It could get boring when he does the proofs. Sometimes he goes too fast leaving some students lost and confused, but most of the time he is very clear. Much better than Tolman. Scales most exams.

His lectures are super helpful and he has a great sense of humor. His office hours are really helpful as well. I learned a lot from him.,"I took MATH 241 with Leininger freshman year, and he was probably the best teacher I had that year. It was by no means an easy course, and you had to really work for an A, but his lectures were always interesting,  and covered the material very well.","Although he lectures a bit fast sometimes, Leininger explains Calc 3 concepts very well. The book is not necessary, but it's a nice resource to understand the material better. Practice tests are provided online, so you will know what is expected on midterms. I highly recommend him!","Leininger does a great job explaining the topics. The book is not necessary, but it is a nice resource to get more information for more clarification, since he does lecture at a slightly fast pace (for me). Practice tests are provided online, so you will know what is expected on the midterms. Highly recommend Leininger!",It's hard because of the nature of the course.  He's really funny and that was an incentive to go to lecture.,"He's a solid professor overall. He's wildly intelligent, and unfortunately, that shows when he proves things on the board in every lecture. He can be hard to follow, but he does a decent job of explaining, and the difficulty of the homework makes the quizzes and tests easy as pie","In the beginning of the semester, I went to both his lectures and Schenck's lectures. If possible, choose Leininger! He explains the concepts more thoroughly and spends more time trying to help his students understand the material. Go to office hours! Calc3 may not be easy to learn, but it was the most interesting calculus class I've taken so far.","Good lecturer, really helps you to understand the concepts in depth.  Did not need the book at all, actually.  Just don't sweat the tests because he DOES curve them and he curves them generously.","You can tell Leininger is a really smart guy (loves to do long proofs in lecture).  Once you get used to his teaching style, you realize he's very good at explaining the more difficult concepts of Calc 3.  Definitely take advantage of his office hours-he's very helpful!  Exams are pretty easy... do the practice exams and the book's chapter reviews.","Took his honors course; it was brilliant. Class format is great; gives partial points easily although tests are difficult. I'm not sure about large lectures, but his honors course was genius.","He goes into long proofs of things you won't even have to know and never really fully explains things in lecture. you might as well just go to the discussion sections or read the book, it is more helpful.",He does not explain the concepts too well in lecture. You might as well read the book instead of attending his lectures. The tests he gives are somewhat difficult with a multiple choice question that could be worth 15% of your grade.

You don't need to do all the reading that's assigned, only really to reinforce shaky topics.","He's got a subdued, but nice sense of humor, so lectures could be pretty entertaining. He always was willing to work with people who would make the effort to work with him. Only 3 tests and 2 papers for grade, so it can be a bit difficult to get a super high grade. Has a set of key terms which is super useful to study for exams.","Leon made the lectures very interesting and the class itself was really interesting and informational. However, there were only 3 tests and 2 papers, so you need to do well on almost all of them or you won't get a very good grade.

This class is hard for someone never got in touch in pure maths before. I did not get a satisfying grade even though I worked really hard, but this is still inspiring and funny. and most of students in this class do got 90s",He goes through material very quickly leaving everyone confused. Homework is very difficult and the only reason I passed the class is because I memorized the textbook rather than learning from lectures.,Goes over material with little clarification. Poor responses to student questions. Goes through lectures very quickly and didn't try explaining material in other ways.,"One of the best teachers I've ever had. Explanations are amazingly clear and he really takes the time to make sure you see how the ideas connect. He didn't like some of the proofs as they were given in the book, so he did them differently. Was able to answer virtually any question asked in class.","good professor, very nice, post class notes on line for student to review.  lecture is very clear. study hard and you will be fine.","lerman is a very good professor. this guy knows a lot and he can definitely answer all of the questions you might have, the hard part is the lecture content is so abstract and very hard to grasp. so make sure you keep up the pace within lecture. also, he never curves. so prepare to study hard before exams.","Dr. Lerman is awesome! His exams are hit and miss, but beyond that, he is an amazing professor. He single-handedly restored my faith in the math department at UIUC; I was regularly enjoying and understanding math for the first time since calculus. If the choice is between him and anyone else, take Lerman's class.","Lerman's 416 class was fun. He has a great sense of humor and he knows his content well. He is willing to help students, and you can tell he wants to help you succeed. Even though he speaks clearly, he couldn't explain content well enough for me to understand it.

He never curves, and to be honest, his exams are HARD! not recommend at all!","Professor Lerman is a good professor, but the MOST difficult part of this class is that there's no curve. One test was 3 A's, 1 B, 7 C's, 8 D's, 3 F's and there was still no curve (even though there's a mix of grads and undergrads). Otherwise, Lerman has a pretty interesting sense of humor. Encourages questions and doesn't make you feel stupid.","It's very easy to feel overwhelmed, especially in the beginning when he does a ton of proofs. But this class is very do-able with a little work. His tests are extremely fair and straightforward and he gives practice problems almost identical to test questions. He's very smart, and pretty funny. I would take a class with him again.","He knows his stuff.  You learn a lot.  Disagree with his grading methods, but whatever.","His exams are easy.  However, he is arrogant and will give you a lot of discouraging statements. He is not available to help and sticks very strictly to office hours. Just leaves the second his office hours are over. Will even hint that you are stupid.","He is a very good professor, doesn't grade on a curve but his tests are very straightforward, knows alot about the subject and was quite qualified to teach an honors section of 241, highly recommended","HWs are very straight foward. exams are cake. a lot of topics, so you can get lost. but if u apply yourself, it's your chance to learn vector calculus, because he not just know, but also knows how to teach.","Easiest tests ever.

There are HUGE curves on exams, and you don't really need to do much to prepare for this class. The only downside are the PEC's but that's a dept requirement. He uses attendance as part of the grading, but overall, I would def recommend!","I had him at UIC. hes super nice and loves when people ask questions. overall the quizes are easy, exams are curved, and only 2 essays were needed and graded easy. I only wish we didnt need to do the 8 hours of PECs. those are a waste of my time.",I had him at UIC. He was my favorite professor there.

If your experiments don't work, you don't lose points for it. She seems to care that students do well","Content isn't hard but there's a lot of information to memorize for the exams. Reading the textbook at least once and going through the slides will help you prepare for exams. Also, go to Dr. Levesque's office hours. She's helpful although her lectures are a bit dry. HW and prelectures are 40% of the class so they can balance out poor exam grades.","Dr. Levesque is one of the most kind-hearted professors I've had.  She knows what she is talking about, goes over everything you need to know for the exams, and is explicit when answering students' questions.  The class itself is challenging, but if you to lecture and pay attention to what she is saying, you'll do fine.","This was the first time this course was being offered. It was a great way to contibue MCB 253, and Dr. Levesque taught this lab very well. She taught it herself and didn't use a TA, which I really appreciated. Her protocols were very straightforward, and she was always there and ready to help if we messed up or were confused. Final exam was v. fair","Everyone complains about her, but please know that if you go to lecture, she says all the info in class (no reading required!) Recording lectures is super helpful to go back. She teaches the hardest material btw. the two profs., so that's why I think most don't like her, but she is kind, passionate, and very helpful. Just attend OHs and lectures.","Reading the past reviews really scared me when I took this course. However, many of the reviews are out-dated or aren't accurate anymore. Stuttering was not very noticeable and the pace of the class is fair. Exams were also very do-able if you followed along with reading and went to class.  Lectures can be boring, but interesting course overall.",Her free response questions were completely unfair and she was very unhelpful if you asked questions about the homework. She would say the book was wrong but there were a few time I KNOW she was wrong and she'd deny it. Horrible professor. Take a different class if you can.,I am a Premed student whom loves science. This class was so unorganized and so poorly taught that it made me despise a class that I was excited to take. Most students do not attend lecture because it just makes everything more confusing. The professor reads off of slides that only contain half of the necessary information.,"TERRIBLE. Have to take this for grad/vet school l but it is absolutely awful. She cannot teach at all, and her exams are near impossible. Wrote over 100 pages of notes for the final and will still probably get a D on the test.",DO NOOOT TAKE HER CLASS.,"Before taking this class, I was very excited about this class. After attending the first few lectures, I became completely overwhelmed. Her lectures have basically nothing written, and she mumbles and is hard to understand. In addition, there is a ridiculous amount of reading and no study guides for exams.","She has been hands down the worst teacher I've had here. Reads straight off the power points, throws in little details on the exams that she doesn't go over in class, and with an average class rating on exams at a 60% her justification is we're lazy and the people who get A's try harder. unreal.","Very difficult class&amp;shes a very confusing teacher/test writer. Exam questions are very detailed&amp;specific. Her stuttering makes it difficult to take notes, and she easily gets flustered when students ask her questions. Read the book and go to class to make it easier; just hope you know enough to get by, because she tests on way too much material!","Honestly, this class was very straight forward and for the most part she was explicit about what she was looking for on exams. I think many students often blame her inadequate speaking skills (which is okay if you get past her stuttering); however, the difficulty of the material is minimal which doesn't justify blaming her for poor performance.",This was the worst class I have taken in college up to this point.  The lectures are very dry and boring. There is oftentimes about 150 pages of material to read and memorize in about 2 week time constraints.  In this class it is almost impossible to succeed no matter how much time you commit.,No.  Just no.  This woman has no public speaking skills and has a difficult time communicating class material.,"Terrible professor, she can't teach for her life. There is way too much reading in this class~600 pages.. 35 chapters..","She has no idea what she is talking about - never tries to find the answer to questions. She mumbles so much that it is impossible to take notes. Says only what we cover in class is on the exam... yet adds if it is in the book we have to know it too. Has potential to be a good/interesting class, but definitely needs a new instructor.","If you are more inclined to be strong in biology and you read the book and take good notes, you will be okay. She is hard to understand at times.  This is not a class to take lightly, but with diligence it can be done.  Take with a light and easy course load if you can.","Honestly I don't know what these people are complaining about. This class is easier than MCB 150 and half the things you learn in this class you can learn through AP Bio in high school.

The notes are useful and guide you though the materials. He is teaching ME 300, 310 and 370. Definitely choose him if you can.",His interactive lecture style and guided quizzes are engaging and really helped me learn the material without any time consuming nonsense. I felt I got the most out of his lectures and his exams were hella fair. He deeply cares about his students and puts in more work than any other professor I've had to make sure we succeed. Take fluids with him.,"Great professor. Very caring, and gives out a lot of notes. His lectures are very helpful, and complement the reading very well. His grading is very fair, too. I would definitely recommend taking ME 300 with him, as this was his first class in the states and he is only bound to get better.",You'll be hard pressed to find a prof so considerate and hard working. He prepared so many paper handouts that my backpack was literally crammed full of study resources to make my life easier. He is also a considerate grader. I'd give him 10 stars if I could. It was his first class in the US so I'd only expect him to get better. 100% recommend him.

She loves talking to her students about what they're reading and get their perspectives. Never tells you you're wrong. Just loves to listen. Loves to teach. Loves to interact! Not hard at all, but I learned a lot and actually enjoyed going to class!!",She had a very unclear method for teaching this class. And the assignments were vague at times.,No Comments,"Very easy and helpful!  You read a short story every night and are required to post on moodle once every 2 weeks or so.  Your grade basically depends on how much you participate in class.  Tests are super easy!!!!!  One big project due at the end of the year, but you have all semester to work on it","Loved her! She is just a cool, fun TA. She succeeds at making the class fun and exciting. Read some cool stories. Great personality. FaBULous!! Definitely would take another class with her.","Really easy class, would work with students"
557537,3.6,Harry,Liebersohn,20,0.4582804228234167,Wow this class is about early modern Euro-History on Romantic and political themes. Professor Liebersohn engaged everyone  throughout discussions. The amount of readings are high. A fair grader on papers with understandable feedbacks. I suggest visit him during office hours so he can see that you are making an effort to do well in class.,"I actually had 3 classes with him (one was a lecture), and I liked all of them. His voice is a bit dull, but he's great for working one on one.","This professor is a very nice friendly man to talk to regardless his lectures are somehow boring with interesting materials, the exams and papers graded by TA, but not that hard, to do well need a lot memorization, this professor definately has a strong perception of European History.","I had Liebersohn for a class on World Music and History. A phenomenal writing critic, kind and approachable (if soft-spoken). Eager to learn from his students and demonstrates enthusiasm for and mastery of the subject. Great out-of-class mentor as well. Highly recommended for serious students.",So boring. I'm going to be absolutely serious in saying he did not teach me one thing the entire semester. I attended every lecture and everything I learned came from my own reading of the textbook. Tests are all Identification questions and essays. Tests don't deal with lecture. He DOES go on tangents and he DOES have a dull voice. Avoid.,"Do not take this as a gen ed. He goes into too much detail and doesnt explain the themes well enough. Talks too much about things you don't need to know for an introductory history class, like specific music of the age and individual leaders lives from the time they were born. Also, he is so hard to hear even with the microphone he has a dull voice",Really difficult. He went on long tangents that had nothing to do with material we'd be tested over. Wasted a lot of time in lecture on it. Exams were essay and short response which were difficult because there was so much information to remember.,"He's a fair teacher and you can tell he really cares about his students learning something new. It was a graduate discussion class and Prof. Liebersohn treated everyone as adults, with respect and a real interest to hear contributions. We read a LOT, but my writing, analytical reading and writing process improved. I'm glad I was part of the course.","Some people in the class probably find him boring, but I think he is really interesting if you just pay attention. He is very sharp and has great insight. He is very knowledgeable within his field too. Some people here have said he is monotone, but there is really more nuance than they give him credit for.","Nice guy, but really boring. Had his class 8AM M,W,F and it was easier to fall asleep in his class than in my own bed at the dorm. Someone already said it, but MONOTONE! Terribly boring lecturer, but seems like a really nice man. TA's are dumber than half of the students, and the a lot of the essays are out of the blue.","Easy class for the first 15 weeks, then an impossible final ruining your grade.  Good professor though.","He is boring. The class is really early. His exams are easy, but graded harshly. Plus some of the questions are ambiguous. But you can succeed by reading the book or summaries of the topics and just skip class.",Look up the definition of MONOTONE...you'll find his picture,I love the sound of his voice; I was disappointed the few times we had a guest lecturer since I looked forward to his daily music and ability to orate. You can tell he is very passionate about the subject and wants his students to succeed.,He is really really boring!,"Tough grader, but fun to have class with.","I've taken him for two classes now, and I think he's great.  Very understanding of student's needs, you just have to talk to him.  His lectures can get a little boring, but what lectures aren't?","Doesn't follow his own note outlines, jumps around, but he does sound like Burt from Seasame Street.  Not too bad of a class...","Pretty Easy Class but he is very boring to listen to. Its hard not to fall asleep, especially if it's a morning lecture.",Pretty good so far...

It is extremely clear what will be on the test.  She wants students to pass and makes herself accessible.  Class is very proof based and sometimes she becomes flustered during class, but she does an effective job of teaching the class.","She's really kind and is happy to help if you go to office hours. However, lectures are dull and mostly teaches from the textbook. But, she really wants everyone to do well so exam prep is clear and there's a healthy curve","She gives A's to the top 40ish percent of the class. Exams are straightforward, and she makes practice exams with very similar problems. Best way to prepare is completing graded and ungraded homework, as test problems are about the same","She does a lot of example but speaks quietly and doesn't utilize technology in her lectures.

She was rude and got caught up in unimportant things. She only seemed to be concerned about students being on time, showing up, and was super strict about electronics. So if you're looking for a class to sit and be on your computer, I don't suggest this class. I did love guest speakers though.","Her class is a complete waste of time. It's easy, but you don't learn anything. Like at all. This is upsetting when it's the one SPED class secondary education students take as it could be really useful and interesting, but it isn't.

With the stealthy eyes of a hawk and absolutely nothing better to do, Cheryl with scope you out across the lecture hall if you are using your phone.  10/10 learned nothing, but still got an A.","This class is very easy.  However, we're treated like 3rd graders and are not allowed to use phones or laptops; she doesn't understand that millennials can multitask.",The class is super easy but there is a ton of busy work. Prof. Light Shriner will fill your email box up and that gets annoying. I have her once a week for an hour and a half and she send 7-10 emails. It is an easy A if you do the work but you have to show up to class. Lectures are typically boring but they should be amazing.,"Loved the material, absolutely hated the teacher.  She does not grade fairly at all.  The only way to get a good grade out of her is to kiss her ass.  If one of her 'teaching team members' grades your material, you can get an A.  Why does she need a team to her job?  Because she is awful to work with. Too bad because material was great.",Not helpful. Scolds students. Doesn't really teach.,Treated students as if we were still in high school. Has a seating chart so class is mandatory. Too concerned about rules and not teaching the students.,"Doesn't know how to teach. the only technique used in faculty-students communication was making threats. Has extremely unrealistic expectations. The most authoritarian person I've ever met in my whole life, worse than the worst I met back in the military."

His lecture can be interesting and the class is easy if you put forth the effort.,"Good teacher, but this class is just.. useless.  I don't think I learned anything from it.

If you don't show up, he will not help you at all, and will work against you.",Very flexible with homework as long as you put forth effort.

Lectures are only once a week, so make em. And they sometimes include MOVIES!","Has a wealth of experience from starting several engineering businesses of his own.

Tests are tough.","Nori was a great professor. He always made sure students understood topics, and if anyone ever had a question he never hesitated to go back over the topic.

Im a BPM major so i enjoyed everything about this class but the cheat sheets for the exams are nice for anyone. The class isn't to  bad overall in terms of material.

I went to office hours a few times and he wasn't that helpful and he seemed kind of angry when i showed up. One benefit is the class had a gigantic curve (somehow i got an A- and i didnt know how to solve boundry value problems).","A little hard to understand at first, but you'll get used to it.  If he tests you on something besides the homework, he will go probably over it thouroughly in class.

This was not an ""applied"" class but a SAS output class.","Professor Lipka is a terrible instructor. He claims to hate SAS but then lectures only on SAS output. He was unable to clearly convey the topic and sometimes had difficulty answering student's questions. Every single week we had a quiz and homework, where the grading was fair, however, the exams were graded extremely harsh."

There's a lot of materials covered in 312, so go to each lecture if you don't wanna cry before the exams.",Awesome professor who really cares about his students and is interested in the material in class.  The class is not easy but he does his best to make it understandable and is always willing to help.  Highly recommend taking this class with him.,"Great lecturer, clearly interested in actually teaching","Lisowsky is an AWESOME professor! I was dreading this class and he made it interesting.. well as interesting as tax can be! All the info you need is taught in class and he always gives plenty of examples. Tests and quizzes are hard so you can not slack off, I wouldn't recommend missing class. Textbook was so expensive and I never even used it!","Go to class unless you can get the notes from someone. He writes out his notes on the whiteboard every day rather than lecture notes which can be a drag. Test/quizzes are hard. If you actually work the in class problems/""suggested"" homework problems you'll do well in the class. 5-10% curve, I got a B with minimal effort &amp; senioritis."

The lectures are usually really helpful but so incredibly boring.,"Good professor, explains thing pretty well.  Lectures are pretty boring but they are usually helpful.  Homework, labs, and discussion quizzes are easy points and help with understanding the material.  Overall pretty easy course if you have any physics background.",Fun guy. Only real problem is his voice is kinda monotone so even if you're interested in the subject it's really easy to drift off. Some of the explanations can be a bit fast and probably are confusing if you don't know what's going on already.,"Class was really boring, stopped going after the first exam and saw no difference in my performance on homework, quizzes, and exams. He really likes demos, but he doesn't explain things well. When you ask him questions afterwards, he's sarcastic.","Very funny, great lecturer. He knows the material perfectly and enjoys teaching it. Material in 211 starts out easy, then gets hard, but he teaches it well enough.","He make Physics class so much fun, I like him","Great guy with dry humor. very likeable, but you have to study the lecture slides more than lectore notes in order to do well in the class, somewhat difficult","good lecturer. funny, good halftime shows. dont need to go to lecture everything in the notes.",Quality teacher; accessible.  Cares about the education of his students.  Uses the blackboard to derive important relationships which improves understanding.  Good lecture notes.,"Easily one of the best lecturers on campus. He'll keep your attention in lecture and his demos help you understand the material. Excellent online lecture notes. His exams are very comprehensive, but fair. I wish he taught other physics classes, too...","Good teacher, much better than the 212 one, plus hes pretty funny any makes it interesting.","Liss is a good professor, although I had a hard time in the class.  In his lectures, he isn't completely borring and his demos help you really learn what he is teaching.  The tests are a bit hard but if you study about a week in advance for them, you should be fine.","He's funny, but that doesn't help you learn the material.","He was very entertaining in lectures, but that didnt keep me from sleeping often.  The class is tough, but if you ask for help, he helps a lot, and it makes it much easier.","The demos and jokes in lecture were pretty good, but I would have benefitted more from a non-powerpoint style of teaching, maybe even non-lecture. Buy the lecture notes, not the textbook. The online homework is tough, so don't wait until 3am to start it.",Liss is awesome!

Doable, but could be better",he makes chem so much harder than it needs to be. I can see why hes good for higher level classes but not for intro classes. He blatantly refuses to alter his teaching methods to suit the needs and requests of the class. his tests are impossible. and he is very pompous. my opinion of him started high but got worse as the semester went on.,"Professor Lisy is a rather intelligent person and is very concerned with his students learning something.  He is very helpful if you ask him a question, and takes the extra time to explain WHY a theory works.  He never presents a concept without ample theoretical or mathmatical evidence.  However, he does come off as pompous in lecture.","Lisy is one of the most pompous professors that I have ever had the misfortune of dealing with, he over complicates things, he laughs at his students questions, lectures consist of him reading straight off of the power point, and he blatantly refuses to write on the board even after we requested it several times.  And his tests suck.","Excellent professor.  He's ridiculously smart, but doesn't flaunt it at you.  He knows his stuff, and can teach it to you.    No matter what your grade in the class, you're going to come out knowing soooo much material so well it's going to shock you.  I'd take any class from him in a heartbeat."

This class was more like a book club for SciFi fans. The most days were open discussions. No tests and the 'papers' are easy and short and you get to chose between a few prompts. The final project is fun. Daily readings are all manageable with full schedule,"This class was a breeze, and Littlefield was really helpful. She was quite accommodating when there were technical problems, and really friendly in all her emails.","Melissa is such a cool woman... a SciFi nerd in the best way!

He is really understanding about iClickers. A few times he changed his PowerPoint on the spot to reword a confusing question. He stayed after to clarify lecture points and knows most students by name.,"Great professor. You can tell he is really passionate &amp; knowledgeable. iClickers/tests are really straightforward. Sometimes can be unclear during lecture but is enthusiastic when answering questions. People who can't understand him are sitting in the back, he is perfectly fine. Those who try to prove wrong are attempting to bend class to them","He's hard to understand, students often times prove him wrong. Iclickers are your attendance.  Online quizzes weekly.","He knows that GEOL 107 is taken by a bunch of engineers that are only taking it to satisfy electives so he goes easy on as he can on everyone .

The professor did not teach, just sits and learns with students. Sometimes he makes comments but hard to find relevant and useful. Wired is he does not allow auditing, saying the course is too difficult. There ends up to be only six students.","Apparently he did not prepare well for the course.

There were only four students taking the course, whereas more than 30 were taking the same course when another professor was the instructor.",He was not clear at many points in the class and confused everyone.,"He is definitely not for teaching.

I was very fond on how he gives students a large amount of autonomy in writing papers.",Good instructor. Pretty easy course but not so boring. Best Gened for engineering student.,Professor Livengood is one of the best professors I have ever had at UIUC. His passion for helping students is immense and he will literally spend hours with you if you need the help. For me personally the class was not simple but Livengood made it understandable by walking me through it.,"Excellent, excellent teacher. Intelligent, calm, helpful. Highly recommended. He challenges you and is crystal clear and organized. His textbook was overdue (exam came mostly from lecture slides... which were also overdue); he is still a one-of-a-kind, true TEACHER. So rare. Absolute 5.0. Class was thought-provoking.","Great professor, class was alright. He is terrible about putting things online but one of the most helpful teachers I have ever had at UIUC.

I didnt take the class very seriously and ended up with an A. Just make sure you are participating and putting in effort and she will reward you for showing up to class and trying. Its really not as bad as people say.","Way too much work, no room to write what you want, all environmentalism all the time","I'm a terrible writer and hate all types of english and writing. However, she made class rather interesting. Points are easy to come up with in this class, except for the three big papers, which are not all that bad.

I took it again next semester and got an A. If you don't to the assignments exactly the way she wants you to, you should forget getting a good grade in this class.

2057953,4.2,Avital,Livny,16,0.5131369499860828,Prof Livny is such a good lecturer she points so much enthusiasm into lectures. She's very big on participation so you HAVE to go to lecture. There are a lot of online reading so if you print them out it becomes an expensive class. Her lectures go through everything in the readings but I still read them because she givesa gist of a 30 page reading.,Took her class as an easy gen ed and I wasn't disappointed. Just go to class and take notes and you'll be fine. One assignment every week that's super easy. She basically tells you what's on the test and really tries to look out for her students. She's incredibly nice and is always helpful. I recommend her completely.,"A very caring professor. She was very clear and understandable, considering that comparative politics can be a little difficult to grasp at first. Responds to emails quick and is very accessible outside of class. You can tell she wants you to do your best.","I absolutely loved having Prof. Livny this semester. Her enthusiasm is contagious and her personality made coming to class fun. She can be a bit slow with grading assignments, but the feedback is very useful when it does show up on Compass. Would highly recommend seeing her in office hours too -- they're helpful!","I did not have a good experience with Prof Livny. First, her lectures were boring. Second, she required participation, but then made me feel stupid when I spoke in class. She would also act like she was available to students ONLY when she was in front of the class. When I actually tried to talk to her one on one, she blew me off. Twice.","Incredible professor! Very attentive to students during lecture, wants participation and for the students to engage during lecture. Discussion is important and participation makes a chunk of your grade, but ultimately if you skim the readings and get the main points you'll be able to participate well. Funny, charismatic, intelligent.","To receive a good grade you would have to speak and answer questions out loud during a lecture that had at least 40 students in it. This requirement made students speak for half of the duration of lecture. By paying a lot of tuition money to attend lectures, I want to hear what the professor has to say about the subject, not other students.","She knows the topic, but the lectures are based largely on class discussion. This can be frustrating because she is trying to fish out the main points of the lecture from students, so it isn't quite clear what you should be writing down/studying. The tests are also a bit tricky.","Prof. Livny is an extremely knowledgable, successful woman, an amazing speaker, and a down to earth person. I took PS 152 as a GenED knowing little about the topic and could not be happier about how much I've learned from her. She's always prepared and makes everything interesting. She also always does her best to respond to what students need!",Professor Livny is a great teacher who really cares about her students. She wants everyone to succeed and learn the material instead of just teaching for the test. I would love to take a class from her again in the future.,"No textbook but required readings.  Every week there are reading questions worth 40% of grade. She is a fun lecturer and there is participation for going, but I skipped class a bunch and was fine. Grade depends on TA. Livny is adorable and really cares about the students.","Livny is super knowledgeable and her lectures were engaging. Lots of interesting material, cool visualized data. Grades were made up of weekly reading quizzes, two exams &amp; participation. Some ppl here mentioned long readings; but remember she never expected us to read every single page - selective, strategic reading will do. You'll learn a lot!","Her PS199 class was a bit too difficult for freshman. There was A LOT OF papers to read, but you really get a good sense of what real political science is about. Also she explains pretty well during class, and the class is very interesting! Seriously considering doing PS grad school after taking her class.",She took forever to grade papers. Lectures and notes were very clear. Really nice and great to talk to.,"While Prof Livny is a very knowledgeable person, I feel like the readings she gave for this specific class were very tiring. They were too long which lost me at times as a student. The concepts and lessons were always very interesting but homework was nothing to I ever looked forward too. Not a bad class at all.","Professor Livny is great. She's very intelligent, well-spoken and passionate about the Middle East. You get 8 options of assignments and only have to do 4, and then one paper at the end of the class. Her class is focused on research methods with broad themes, rather than specific info, so just know that going in."

Go to office hours as often as possible, and keep up with POTDs. Good luck!","Just keep up, and it's really pretty easy. Watch video lectures seriously for the 30 minute span. Do the practice problems sometime before the test. and work on quizzes with friends. Curves are super super generous. Very possible to get an A in this class. If you get the hang of it, it's pretty easy to grasp all concepts. All self motivated.","This class is all online. It's a lot of self discipline because you technically do not have to attend lecture... If you keep up and do all the POTD's, quizzes, and mock exams he gives out, I think that it is all shown fairly on the test. Dr. Nick is one of the best professors I've ever had.","I hate organic chemistry, and it's really stupid that the class is online.  The professor doesn't even have a lecture.","This class has a lot of resources for students who are struggling, and there's a grading exception to help students who are struggling early on in the course. Even though it isn't easy, it isn't terribly difficult if you pay attention. By the end of the class, you can solve almost any mechanism you look at using the tools you acquire.",Orgo is hard. And it's a mess at U of I because it's online. You have to do everything you possibly can to understand because the lecture videos are unclear and oversimplify the mechanisms. I found the POTDs were too easy compared to the quizzes and exams. VERY generous curve. Do all your work so you can use final modifier. Otherwise you're screwed,"REally helpful professor. Listen to his online discussion, much better than the TA led ones. GO TO OFFICE HOURS!!!","Nice professor; generous curve; useful resources. He is always ready to help you whatever via email or office hrs. KEEP IN MIND!!! do you quiz problems with study group, go to SI at least onece a week, it is not that hard to get A.","Probably the hardest class I've taken in my three years at U of I. However, Dr. Nick is a great professor. Discussions are very helpful, as are the (optional) homework problems. Grade consists of weekly quizzes, three midterms and a final. Effort is essential to success.","Yes, there are weeks where you have to put in 15+ hours, welcome to college. Dr. Nick does a great job in debunking the funk of organic chemistry. There are tons of resources available, he archives all of his online discussion sessions, and his curves are always fair. Best chemistry teach I've had so far, highly recommended.","Well, he is nice. Just homework, quiz, and exams are way beyond the lecture's material. Do not expect a good grade unless you spend 15hrs per week on CHEM 232 only.","You have no idea about this class. Extremely harder, if you want to get B+ or better. 2 hr per day, not include discussion , online video, SI.","In the beginning, I didn't really try hard in this class and that was a BIG mistake. But towards the end, I studied really hard and I began to understand everything. He's a GREAT professor. So good at teaching in my opinion. DO NOT slack off and go to discussions! Work really hard from the beginning and you'll do fine.",,"I thought his tests were really fair. He gave curves for each exam which were very generous. He always held exam reviews.

His final was a great representation of the ""mock exam"" Great professor","Wow..If you wanna take a class that makes you hate your life I highly insist Orgo with Llewellyn.

He is an incredibly smart ad caring man, and he really wants you to succeed.  Tests and honors assignments are really difficult; I would recommend doing all of the relevant proofs to study for the midterms and final.","He is excellent with clear explanations on the material. Lectures are fun. Honors homework is difficult and needs effort, but exams are fine if you pay attention in class.","He's the best math lecturer I have ever had. Very intelligent. Explains things extremely well. Very fair with grading. His office hours were very helpful. Responses to emails right away. Honors homework is tough, but very enjoyable to do. Sad that he will only be here for a year.",He knows the materials and gives good explanation. Homework (for Honors) and exam are really fair.

However, without any practice exams, expect the worst when it comes to the real thing. I learned a great deal, the course is psuedo manageable, but the teacher himself is sub-par",He collects homework. Very boring teaching style. Doesn't like to answer questions. Is not a fan of numbers. Try not have him as your professor. He doesn't teach well...at all.,Terrible teacher.  Useless.,pure torture.  i never felt more stupid in my entire life,All I can say is if you some how end up with this guy as your professor you had better make good use of the tutors available and go talk to your TA every week during office hours.  If you cant put that much time into this class then you should probably switch to another section.  Probably one of the worst professors out there.,This class was awful.  He would ask if any one had any questions then when we would ask he would tell us to go back and look at the notes online.  If you take this class be prepared to teach yourself calculus.,"Overall a pretty bad teacher. Can't explain the material at all. Instead of showing examples, he explains everything in theory making it hard to follow. I was lucky to have a really good TA. He did end up giving us ""Sample Problems"" though that were basically right from the test because people were doing so bad on tests.","Oh Peter Loeb. This guy has a way of making you feel absolutely stupid for asking a question whether it pertained to math or not. Plus, he's not a fan of the book and advices you not to read it; however he doesn't teach you the material. As for Math 220, maybe find a tutor, but definitely a different professor.",No Comments,ahhh loeb ... he was a funni man indeed. i must say i will miss him awfully even though i had to learn all of calculus on my own. its kool...no hard feelings. farewell loeb and to all the suckers that are gonna be taking him i have two words for you : AH HAAAA.  (uz better work ur butt off...),"He was rather annoying and used some of the stupidest analogies ever.  The class was o.k., but I definitely wish I would have had a different professor.","He's a horrid teacher that has no business in  the education system. I can't deny that he's probably one of the brightest people ive met, but he is absolutely clueless as to how to convey anything his bald head thinks of. If you've never had calculus before this class, dont take Loeb. You'll Fail.","This is easily one of the worst ""teachers"" I've ever had.",He's really sporatic and easily distracted and VERY easy to fall asleep to.,"Loeb really likes mathematics; I think he doesn't always realize that his students don't.  Discussion sections are very important for learning the material.  He really focuses on theory over examples, so make sure you understand it.","Prof. Loeb is a very intelligent professor.  He is very nice and caring.  At first it doesn't seem like it, but you will realize how caring he is after he curves the tests.  An 87 is usually still an A.  The tests are difficult because he tests theory instead of working out problems.  A++++","BEWARE OF HIS GRADING POLICY: He gives you ""letter grades"" for tests, and they end up being merely ""suggestions of where you stand in the class."" I got a B-/B average in the class, but ended up with a C+ because the professor is a screw-off.",Proving equations sucks and thats all this class is.,"Very great at mathematics, but unclear in his teachings.  The online homework is easy though--but he only teachers based on theorems and proofs of equations--if you're taking calc for the first time, be ready to do a lot of learning on your own.",He's pretty lenient when it comes to grading policy....but he sucks as an instructor.

There are many writing assignments which are graded hard. Definitely not a class to take just for fun.,Good teacher,Extremely intelligent and well spoken. Definitely makes an impact.,His grading is very very subjective and be careful if you ask him to explain things further as he may get very annoyed. He only has one office hour because apparently he is very busy.,This was probably one of the best classes and professors I encountered during my first MBA year at U of I.

I would take this again.","His instructions are not clear and sometimes disccusions are graded pretty harshly, overall it's an easy class","This class is hard, but its a two-in-one gen-ed knockout, and the content is very stimulating. Unlike most classes, you have to actually participate to pass. Sections are easy and offer extra credit every week. Very funny dude. Not much more I can say.",Definitely going to choose Prof. Looney's class again! Interesting class and easy A. You can bring notes to exams so you don't need to remember a lot. Lots of bonus points available and the observatory sessions are awesome!,I overall enjoyed this class because the assignments were straightforward and interesting. I just didn't enjoy the video project because I felt like no one in my group cared enough to help.,"Yes, it's possible to get an A but you'll definitely have to work for it. The content is pretty interesting, but you have tog get super organized in this class. You'll have multiple things due every week and a ton lectures to go over. If possible, I'd avoid this class as an 8 week course. You'll definitely always have somethingto do in this class.","Professor Looney has great knowledge in Astronomy, while he can explain them in a super easy way in an elementary class. He taught this class with great passion and great illustration. This class is definitely fun to take. If you are interested in further knowledge that this class won't cover, don't hesitate to ask him. Great teacher.","Looney is a super funny guy and this class was really interesting. It wasn't a complete blow off, but it wasn't too bad. Just do all the homework/observation sessions and study a bit the night before exams and you should pull an A. I would definitely recommend him for a science gen ed. There was no text book and no final.","Professor Looney is the BOMB.  He is a truly good teacher, and really explains material thoroughly.

Looney is very enthusiastic and the course is full of interesting content",He is one of the most enthusiastic and off the walls professors you'll ever meet. His grading is very fair. The exams aren't bad considering you can use a notes sheet. There's lots of Iclickers so you have to show up to class. There's no book used. Take this class its fun and interesting!,"""Sexy Boy"". Killer Skies was one of the best classes I've taken. Looney kept me excited for class and did presentations effectively and with great humor. Highly recommend him in general.

Hilarious, fun, and good.","Loved his Killer Skies class! He's very funny and allows you to bring in a sheet of notes for each test and even the final!

But you get unlimited number of tries, and the highest score is taken","A kind, knowledgeable, phenomenal teacher.  I would recommend any of his classes. He is hilarious, engaging, and intelligent.  This class was so far from my major, and yet I enjoyed class everyday.  Study, its astronomy.

I enjoyed the course because it teaches us the basics of the of structural mechanics very well.","Horrible professor, do not take his class if you don't have to. Mechanics and FEM are taught in different departments as well, take those instead of this professor.","Prof. L. is unable to emphasize key points, explain problems from A to Z, and most importantly, re-iterate key concepts. He lectures far too fast and his writing is sloppy and hard to differentiate between variables. He curves heavily, but I wish he taught better so there would not be a need. Brilliant man, strange class, poor pedagogue.","He presents material in such a way that he expects the class to all be geniuses. The homework problems expect you to already be experts in the material, rather than building on concepts to ensure understanding. The exams are nearly impossible.

At times,  I felt very lost and disinterested in her lectures while other times she gave an especially unique perspective. Attendance is mandatory (1 free absence). 2 projects, 6 short response papers, and weekly quizzes in section for grades,",Loughran is one of  the best professors I had in my time at UIUC.  Loughran's lectures are both interesting and incredibly informative.  I took both 255 and 301 under Loughran's careful tutelage and they were easily my favorite classes.  I always felt known and comfortable in class.  10 out of 10 would take those classes gain just for fun.,Professor Loughran is a professor who can change your life or at least your perspective on it. Survey classes are in their very being made to cover a large array of subjects but Loughran does a phenomenal job making it an eclectic and interesting bunch of texts. Take her course if you're eager to learn and be challenged. Talk to her after class.,"It's a survey class, so I'm not working closely with her. However, her lectures are solid and the reading load is fair for a 200-level course. (I hear she's cut it down, so I guess she's good with taking feedback too.) Overall, this class is nothing special but I'd be interested to have her in a smaller, discussion-based class.","I had to work hard to get an A in this class - it's not impossible, but you definitely need to put the effort in. It's a LOT of reading and writing every week, and the they tend to be more on the difficult to understand/boring side. That said, Loughran is cool and generally flexible, and gives great and useful feedback on papers and assignments.","She knows what she's talking about and is clearly very passionate about teaching. There is a lot of reading and you need to keep up with it, but it usually isn't too bad. I had tried taking ENGL 255 twice before and dropped because of bad professors and she was a lifesaver after two bad experiences! Midterm was take home but final was challenging.","She's a wonderful lecturer with a great insight in what she teaches. Very clear in what she expects, and is easy to talk to. She made my semester a great one.","Without a doubt one of the best teachers I've ever had. 301 is a requirement for the English major and can be pretty intimidating, but Prof Loughran is a phenomenal lecturer. She's a tough grader and makes you work for it so if you're one to slack off this won't be an easy time for you. But the class is so worth it, she makes it less intimidating.","I really enjoyed her class-definitely have to keep up with the reading to succeed though. Lectures are super important to attend. Tests focus on short responses and an essay, plus background on authors, and some quotes. She is very knowledgeable and laid back. Definitely take this class with her if you can.","If you have a chance to take a class with Professor Loughran DO IT. Her classes are not blow offs in the least, but they make you feel like you are actually in college and challenge you to improve your writing and reading.  I literally jump at the chance to take more classes with her.  Helpful, understanding, and personable...she's the best.","She is an expert in the subject and her lectures were fascinating. She is also really funny and good at referencing pop culture now and then. She allowed blog posting as substitution for essay writing, which was fantastic. The class was, however, not a blowoff in the least bit and required a high amount of reading.","She is by far the best English professor I have ever had. She is genuinely interested in the material and students. Literary theory is so difficult to read and understand, but Professor Loughran makes it interesting and relatable. If you put in the time and effort, you WILL succeed.",One of my favorite teachers of all time. She brought the material to life and made everything interesting and applicable to daily life. She also loves pop culture and incorporates it into lecture frequently. Reviews were helpful and she went over important test material and key words minutes before exams. Take ENGL 255 with Loughran. She's awesome.,"Despite having no choice but to teach Survey, she honestly seems extremely invested and interested in it anyway. She has a great sense of humor. Go to lecture! Missing one can hurt you. It's a lot of work and reading, but pay attention, do the study guides, and you're good to go. And go to the exam reviews. They're fun.","Brilliant insights, well-organized and interesting lectures, straightforward exams, and a great taste in music. Would recommend this class to anyone with a deep interest in American History and Lit, not just English majors who have to take it.","Interesting lectures, incredibly insightful, grades fair. The class was a lot of work/reading (but all surveys are) but if you came to lecture and studied her guides you did fine.","Super nice, good taste in music, really helpful, and her lecture material is easily understood.

If possible, try to get Brunet's section as she's been teaching the class a lot longer and has more input on test material.","Has fun ""miracles"" and ""amazing facts"" during lecture, excited by being able to teach.",No Comments,"He keeps students awake by randomly changing the volume of his voice and is fairly helpful in class, on Mallard, and on the Webboard.",Very clear.   Though  I disliked his method of filling in the blanks on the slides as he lectured.
209542,3.8,Geoffery,Love,65,0.3752065080729877,"Worst class I had so far. I do not want to be mean, Love is a nice professor, but it is really difficult to stay awake in his class. It does not help that the exams are graded heavily and are based on memorization. Some say this class is easy, but they either have sharp memorization or an interest in business administration.","He's a nice guy and all but this is one of the most boring classes I've ever taken. It was impossible to sit through. Good news is that you just get EC for going, so you technically don't get punished for missing - I recommend you get all EC possible though. The tests are tough so that'll make up for it. Also be prepared to take HOURS of notes.","He is a good guy. He went to Harvard Buisness School. He is very smart and has a lot of real-life examples. BUT. His lectures are extremely boring, however, you get 2 pts extra credit just for showing up. His tests are awful and even if you thought that you did good, you probably didn't. Don't miss a chance of getting all the extra credit points.","I've never taken so many notes in my entire life. My word doc (size 11 font) of notes for ONLY THIS CLASS is 139 pages long. Get ready to spend HOURS taking notes. If you don't do notes and only go off his power point you will not get A's. But pay attention to power points, he puts things in not from textbook. Must go everyday because iClicker.","So much extra credit it was unbelievable.  Easy professor, nice guy (very smart).","Nice guy, meh class. All memorization based exams, so if that's not your strength it will be more challenging. Homework takes a lot of time (videos you can't skip through), but you get multiple attempts, so you can get 100% easily. 80 points of extra credit from SONA experiments which can boost you a whole letter grade.","Really easy class. Got B's on every exam but did all the extra credit which brought my overall grade to an A. Don't buy the textbook, just study slides before exams, which are tough. Lectures are incredibly boring but he gives extra credit for IClicker participation.","Don't slack off, do the extra credit, and study the powerpoints. Not a blow off class, but slip on one of the exams and you'll be out the A. Lecture material videos are so tacky it drives you insane. Needs updating on modern applications of the material.","Great guy, easy class. The majority of the grade is based on the 3 exams but all you need to do is just go over his powerpoints and find or make your own quizlet flashcards. Going to class is not mandatory but its a lot of extra credit. Easy A.",Great teacher with a lot of energy and enthusiasm. Lecture can be a bit boring but if you pay attention you will get an A. Don't buy the book you don't need it.,"Lectures are super boring and no past exams are given. Homework has no deep connection to exams. A lot of extra credits. Personally, not a fan of him.",Easy A. Just memorize slides/ vocab.,Love is a nice guy but he's super boring. I fell asleep in most lectures but you should still go to get the clicker points. Read the book before the exams. The material is super basic and mainly common sense but you have to know the terms he's looking for.,"Lecture is pretty boring but you can get extra credit by showing up and doing the i-clickers. Make sure you read the textbook before exams, it will really help you out. He uses scenarios and hypothetical situations as most of the exam questions so you have to know how to apply the terms/topics and not just definitions.","Attendance is mandatory because you get iclicker points. Everything in this class is easy, but the exams are difficult. The actual material is not difficult. However, there are too many powerpoint slides and hundreds of definitions to memorize for each exam. Love is a great professor, and he is very kind. You'll love him!",All I can remember about Prof. Love is his pink shirts!!!! And the fact that his class is interesting with the relevant movie clips and iClicker questions kept me focused.,"Basically, if you memorize all his slides you will get A's on his exams. Unfortunately, this is sometimes lots of material for one to digest easily in a short time span. Other than that, there is lots of opportunity for extra credit (can boost your grade by around 5% total) and it's very manageable to get at least a B in this class.","The class is boring! Tests are harder than I expected especially the third one. Read the book is a must. He likes to test on details. Though he said we do not have to remember the examples in the book, some questions are from those. Would be helpful if he can tell us what will be in the test.",The material is very dry so its difficult to pay attention. You have to go to class in order to get attendance points with the iclicker. Good guy but he needs to give some hints as to whats on the exam. He emphasizes the slides but still no direction. It' d be nice if he said what to focus on. Its alot of material to cover when youre studying,"The class is misleadingly easy, and the tests seem misleadingly easy until you get your grades back and find out you didn't do well. Basically just tells you to study everything for exams and makes the lectures as boring as they could possibly be. I dread going to class and have no motivation to try in it."

She goes above and beyond teaching the classroom material.",I could not deal with Mireya. The class was on social justice issues and she pretended that she knew what she was talking about when she really did not. I can honestly say I walked away from the class knowing nothing. I ended up getting a B because I didn't do some side project she wanted. I wouldn't take another class with her even if I was paid.,This was a special topics oral history course.

None of the slides are her own and her attempts to make the class interesting are not a success.","Super boring. I had come into psych thinking that I wanted to do social psych, made me re-think that decision. Lectures are unnecessarily repetitive, and she goes over everything about 1000 times.

Drops lowest exam and other categories.","She was very helpful and since I had this class as an 8am, she made it worth attending. She made the material interesting and showed a lot of movie clips. Also, she brought in donuts/bagels before every exam. Great class!","This was by far my favorite class! Makes Psych super interesting, not a hard grader at all, brings in cookies for the exams, no final, and is the nicest professor I have ever had! Definitely take this class for your James Scholar requirement!!",Does not seem like a college professor at all. Laughably easy exams and extremely easy material to cover. Brings in cookies and granola bars for the class when we took a test. Takes somewhat interesting psych. concepts and makes them dull.,The reason why some people don't have her is because she only teaches the James Scholar section. She is the most fair teacher ever. You get 3 exams and you can drop your lowest one. She lets you explain why you thought a certain answer was right and she'll give you the points. She is the nicest teacher ever ad really wants to get to know us!,She was always talked about but never seen. Her TA's do a horrible job at teaching and she is almost impossible to contact.

She doesn't allow laptops which is really annoying and half the time the iclicker didn't work so even if u do show up you probably won't get points. Minimal work though, easy A.","Lucero was probably the worst professor I've had at University of Illinois. The class was an 8am and she wouldn't allow laptops. She called out students in front of our 500 person class to embarrass them. On top of her behavior, her voice is something no one should have to endure for 2 hours a week. Only take this class if you have to.","Hardly ever did I understand what she was talking about during lecture, but exams may include a few things that she discussed in class. So ask the TAs for clarification, who are kind enough to help. Also, the extra credits may help.",Professor Lucero is so much fun and she's very intelligent and passionate about anthropology. She is very engaging and her lectures are pretty interesting. Would recommend taking a course with her!,Lucero's speech is unorganized and she always seems to just look at the computer and read the slides verbatim. Gives off an annoyingly pretentious vibe.,"Ms. Lucero is a heavy self-promoter. She has no problem going on a tangent to tell her class how great she is at anthropology. Ms. Lucero is also frequently late to class strolling in 5 to 10 minutes late, relying on her teacher assistants to fill the time waiting for her to get here, if she shows up at all.",Her lectures are long and feel disorganized. TA's give their own presentations on some days which liven things up a bit. The grading process is very straightforward. Two midterms and a final. Nothing else. If you fill out the study guide for each exam and maybe attend a few extra credit events you can easily get an A.,No one ever has any idea what she's talking about. Sit in the front since she never turns on her microphone.,"Overall, she is knowledgeable in the field. Her lectures are just reading off the powerpoints verbatim. But the material is easy to learn and memorize, which is why I got an A. However, she has guest lectures often, so she only comes to lecture only 1 day a week. Even though I got an A, I would not another class with her.","Dr. Lucero is very engaging and intelligent. However, if you do not find interest in her topic/teachings it might be boring for you. Overall pretty easy (besides exams!). Great class.","She's very passionate and opinionated which may be troubling for less interested or more conservative students (as previously mentioned). However, Lucero is very knowledgable, available to students, fair, and generous with extra credit.  Exams can be challenging but there is no reason not to get an A if you attend class and participate in projects.","I love Dr. Lucero! She makes this class so interesting, has a pretty good sense of humor, and if you stay on her good side and attend class she is one of the most helpful professors you will meet. She is very opinionated and will let you know her likes and dislikes. It can be difficult but attend class and study for the exams and you will do fine.","I loved her jokes, but a politically conservative student would likely take offense to a lot of things she says. The first exam was of average difficulty. Make sure you participate in the group presentation because it is student- graded. The final exam was optional!","She's kind of ditzy and you can tell teaching is not her #1 priority.  She's very vague in her lectures and I honestly didn't really learn much in her class, but it was an easy A. She's cute though.","She does not care about her students and teaching is not one of her interests. She is unhelpful even if you go to her office hours. She will not explain her grading of tests. Her grading procedures are completely arbitrary. She takes 5 points off (of 100) off essay tests for ""vagueness"" without giving feedback as to what a correct answer would be.",she does not help you. she does not explain test grades or what she wants of the class and then walks out instead of the room after everyone has done miserable on a test saying that all grades are final and that she will not speak with anyone regarding their grades or their test. i am an A student but may be getting as low as a C in this class.,Love her!,Pretty interesting class but essay tests were somewhat hard. You get the questions a week before the exam itself but questions are very vague. And she's not really helpful in answering questions. She's also very passionate and rash in her opinions.

Don't underestimate his ability to write stupid test questions that make you get 42/50 though. A nice guy, yes.",Nice guy and enjoyed teaching. Lectures were mostly from book but he added extra material not in book that was also on the exams.  The exams were multiple choice and very easy.  The final was also not cumulative.  The class was an easy A and was interesting at times.,"Horrible lecturer. He shows up late, then tells everyone how important it is to come to class. Lecture is pointless, as everything is straight from the book. Has a weird obsession with Madonna.","Lugo is the worst professor I have ever had at this University. He is extremely biased towards Latino cultures and focuses no attention on any others, despite the class being CULTURAL anthropology. He goes off on useless tangents for the entire class, and very rarely gives relative or useful information in lecture. Avoid at all costs.","He is kind of melodramatic. It was the easiest class I have ever had, but he's kind of...strange. I don't know. I got a decent grade so I feel bad saying anything negative about him. Easiest class you'll ever have.","His class is very very easy, although his lectures are nearly useless. 2 months into the class, I still have no idea what the main points of the class are. On the plus side, his assignments are a breeze and he's a super easy grader.

Poor explanation of course materials,Good teacher. Good sense of humor. He's definitely a nerd; the beard signifies his commitment to the FSF.

1966413,2.5,Morten,Lundsgaard,8,0.42273123045984834,Just go to lectures for clicker points (which are extra credit if you get right). Honestly regret taking this class 'cuz it wasn't very helpful. I thought I would need it 'cuz my high school physics experience wasn't good and I bombed the physics placement test but tbh this class is honestly just a time consumer when I have other work to do.,Lectures aren't helpful. There is 1 midterm and the final and 6 quests which don't reflect the content from the lectures too well. It's harder than I thought for physics 100.,Lundsgaard is not the greatest lecturer but you get points for attendance so you have to go. The Quests teach you nothing as you never get the questions back to study from. The class is not difficult but you have to do a lot of the learning on your own.,There are only 2 exams including the final. Lectures weren't that helpful but the clicker questions are worth bonus points that go towards the quests grade (which you'll probably want those bonus points). Lumdsgaard is very passionate about physics and I found him most helpful at his office hours. Try not to fall behind or its hard to catch up.,This is an easy class if you don't have harder classes that distract you from it. Lectures aren't helpful; they repeat the prelectures (but you're forced to go for iclicker points-questions turn into bonus if you get them right). Redo the delayed feedback to get back points! Morten is super nice but you'll learn more from the discussion. Good luck!,rereads prelectures but helpful! dont forget your iclicker!!,He's funny,"He's very nice and wants you to learn, but his lectures consist of him rereading the prelecture to you. His office hours are helpful though. He can be a bit difficult to understand."

But, I learned more in one semester with him that I did in any other class I""ve ever taken.

He's an exciting personality with so much talent and so much to give back to his students. He may be at times harsh and snappy but push that aside, you KNOW the guy has a lot to offer.

Don't get too emotional w/ his criticism, you won't go anywhere.","HAHA. man, if you only knew the context of these comments. yes, he's hard. yeah, he's sassy. but he's also smart and a good teacher. from what i noticed, the only people who complained about his classes...well, look at their work. they'll never be good designers.","Jimmy gives picks favorites. If you are not  his favorite, be prepared to get graded harshly. He is snappy, sassy, and can be easily angered. He makes me dread going to class.","Jimmy makes me hate my major. He is completely unreasonable with his expectations (600 page and 50 page process books, explained 4 weeks before due) and is terrible at managing a class (had us watch High Fidelity, so we lost a week that wasn't necessary to lose).

That being said he is hard and if you dont read you are screwed.,TAKE THIS CLASS!,"This class is horrible.  Just because a Professor swears does not make him interesting.  He openly admits that other colleagues in his field are wrong, with no evidence to support his claim. He is very arrogant and you have to buy a lot of books.  Notoriously HARD GRADER!","he goes off on tangents during class, almost never getting through the intended material, his power points are pointless and his handouts lack a lot of important information. his grading system is totally unfair, and his exams are practically impossible. he is pompous and arrogant. He chooses books that are too advanced for a 200 level course",Best lecturer I've ever had.  He's passionate about his work and it shows.

He will let you know he doesn?t want to hear complaints at the start of class, so consider this when to begin class.

Uses current events as well as history u never want to skip his class!,His lecture is AWESOME. But the exam is quite challenging.,Kept things interesting and was very animated.  Final was quite tough,READ FOR THIS CLASS.. I didn't and its going to hurt me. This class was interesting but very hard. It was a bad choice for my elective,Great professor.  Really makes the class interesting with his passion for the subject and funny as well.  Best class I've taken.,"Amazing lecturer, really loves the material and tries to make it interesting for the student. Brings out the social, political, and economic importance and context of military history. He can take a little bit of time to respond to questions, but he's generally supportive and tries to help. I highly recommend any course he's teaching.","Came into class excited but this is 1st time site has led me wrong.  Don't see what the big hype over this guy is.  Lectures are somewhat interesting, but very broad and unfocused compared to tests; he made it very clear he wanted nothing to do with the students or their grades; and dropping a couple f bombs isnt really that funny. Terrible TA also",This guy knows his stuff for sure! Lectures are helpful but I preferred just reading the book.  Some TAs are better than others. Study for exams and you'll do fine.,Lynn's TAs are very unfair with grading.  You write a whole paper and get no credit if it's good but it hurts you if it's bad. His tests are very very hard.

If you want to take easy A classes, just avoid her classes.","I would not like to be a horrible person. But I have to say Lyons is the most mean professor I had ever seen. In her depiction, I am acting like the worst student ever in the world which both me and all my classmates know I am not. I am enough for this kind of unfair treatment. Thank you so much for letting me know how mean a professor can be.","One of the most unreasonable professors I've encountered at U of I. She enjoys making tasks difficult for students, avoid taking her classes at all costs",Professor Lyons is an extremely difficult teacher.

I do not advise to take any courses with her.,not nice at all.,Hardest course taken at ACE,"Super boring lectures; midterm review was 4 pages for 18 multiple choice, 3 short answer, 1 essay; Did not enjoy the class at all; great if you are searching for a job internship though (very willing to help)","Professor Lyons is one of the most thoughtful professors on this campus.

As someone else said, he also tries to be empathetic and understanding and it comes off as very phony and annoying. Wouldn't take a class with him again.","He does take a long time to grade papers, but if you're passionate about the subject it's definitely worth taking his class. As someone who normally skips psych lectures, I made it a point to attend this class because the lectures were great.","Prof. Lyubansky was excellent. It is true that he took a long time to grade papers and journals, but he really does take the time to read everything in detail.  His passion and enthusiasm for the subject is contagious.  I definitely recommend attending class; it is better for your grade, and it's just interesting!","I don't really like his teaching style. He tries to be really empathetic, but it's annoying. Like everyone else said, grading takes for ever because all his assignments/tests are papers. His tests are open note but you need to do the readings to do well.","Very nice and funny! Readings are important. The only thing I didn't like was that he takes forever to post grades. Other than that, interesting class with interesting and for the most part clear material.",He is really funny and kind of adorable. He does a good job of explaining the different therapies.,I am JUST receiving grades for Journal Entries I've completed from the beginning of the semester the night before FINAL grades are due or the semester. You decide if you want to go through the agony of knowing how you are doing in the class.,"Today is December 23.  I am still awaiting 12 grades for assignments, one being a 10 page final paper.  He is rude, arrogant, and superfluous.  It would be in your best interest to avoid this class and instructor.","You must attend lecture: videos, presentations, guest speakers, etc. will be tested on separate from lecture slides. Overall, not a difficult course, but professor was unhelpful with grading + answering emails promptly. We skipped a lot of material because of time. No practical application, as I had hoped. Learned most of the material in PSYC 100.","YOU MUST GO TO CLASS! He hardly follows the syllabus, he takes forever to post grades, the tests are all short answer and essay and he doesn't give much review guidance. He covers so much material and tests you on the most random things. Nevertheless, he's interesting and has charisma.","The only issue I had with him is his grading: he takes forever. The exams are half long essay, half other questions, so it takes a super long time for them to all get graded, plus there's a project/paper and that takes a long time to grade as well. He's a good teacher though, tries to keep things interesting and unique, helpful when you need him.","Easy class. HOWEVER, takes ages to mark papers and exams because he has other commitments - not what you want from a professor. His lecture slides are all over the place - skips back and forth rather than going in order which is just confusing. However, the most annoying thing is that he NEVER responds to emails when you need help. I wasn't happy",great class! it is super interesting! the topic was psychology of race and ethnicity and i learned a bunch! it changed the way i thought about alot of things. he is a great lecturer. his tests were quite fair. you dont really need to go to lecture but it definitely helps. open everything (minus computer) tests,Loved the class. Would recommend this class and professor to anyone. Make sure to go to lecture because then the tests are easier but they are not mandatory. Tests are kind of hard but if you study and pay attention in class you should do well. Teach is very accommodating and I am actually taking a class with him next semester.,"I had to study a lot to pull off an A-. He is horrible at grading things in a timely manner. Each test has an essay portion worth 50% of the grade, and he's very particular about what you must write to get a great grade. Also, for my final project the TA kind of just skimmed my 10 page paper and gave me my grade (I watched her grade it).","I will say that his class was not an easy class. There is a lot of reading and you always have to be on your toes when it comes to the journal assignments. He doesn't give back grades promptly, nor does he give a lot of guidelines for essays. Nevertheless, I enjoyed the material we covered. Take the class, but remember what you're getting into!","This class is interesting, but the professor does a terrible hob at getting things graded on time. He also isn't very fair overall such that his TA does half the grading, which is often not very good. Expectations for the essays are very limited, which can easily bring down your grade. Be careful!","He's not the best lecturer, but he is entertaining in an awkward kind of way. He adds random jokes and even more random clips to spice up his lectures (Buffy the Vampire Slayer, anyone?) which adds to why you should go to class. You will have to study for this class (gasp)--and by that I don't mean just read the textbook and go to lectures.","One of the few classes that I look forward to going to every time, he's funny in a cute/awkward way and good at teaching","LOVE the class.

Posts practice exams before actual exam which are pretty much the same (usually have bonus problems). HOWEVER, the practice final is NOTHING LIKE THE ACTUAL FINAL. The actual final was extremely hard and most of the questions on experimental design were ambiguous.",The exams ranged widely in difficulty.  The first midterm was pretty easy.  The second exam was ridiculously easy.  Then the final was impossible.,"Incredibly easy as long as you do your homework and read your textbook from time to time. If you happen to know some basic statistical functions on your Ti-83/84, then you can blow through the statistical section quickly.

If you are stuck, you can absolutely ask him questions and he will answer it very CLEARLY. He is smart despite you wouldn't think he is too helpful if you dont do the work.","Lecture is not the typical ""absorb everything he says"" kind of thing.

He encourages proper study behavior and makes students work for their grades.","So Amazing ""lecture""!  Umm, Does he really give us a lecture? Holy XXXXX","I'm going to try to be objective here.   The guy is arrogance incarnate. I'm not sure if this conveyance is his intention, but it really seems like he couldn't care less about his students.

I took 225 with him in spring 2016 and I think he was a pretty good lecturer and if you ask him questions or go to his office hours, he is very helpful.

Not much support for this class. Tests are very hard, average has been in the D's. This class is pretty interesting, perhaps the only redeeming  quality.

Which is fairly entertaining.","Sean has extensive knowledge on poem and story writing, but without a textbook I think it was a little hard for him to get some info across now and then and make it stick with the us. That said, the class was incredibly open ended and he offered all kinds of help on his own time. I'd jump off a bridge for the guy because he legitimately cared.",You literally have 2 write a paper EVERY WEEK for this class. 14 papers. Plus the final and a lengthy 12pg self analysis paper at the end of the semester on top of a final. Professor talks like a textbook and then when asked to clarify just talks more like a textbook. Unless you wanna be a burnt out within in 2 weeks of this class avoid it,I honestly hated this class. He makes you write basically the same response paper each week for the ENTIRE semester. On top of that you have a self analysis paper AND a final exam where you must know authors names and titles of work throughout the entire semester. He talks at you like you're a PHD student and has to be right 100% of the time.

Can sometimes go off on seemingly unrelated tangents, but they're a fun ride if you can keep up. She will challenge the way you read literature and understand the world, and this can be frustrating at first but is a very worthwhile experience. Take a Joyce class with her if you can!","One the best professors so far. Would definitely take a class with her again. A little late on communication outside of class though. Besides that, A","She's so insightful, thoughtful, caring.",she's funny,I LOVED this class.,"Dr. Mahaffey is the textbook definition of an English professor. I am sure she is amazing if you are an English major (I am not). Otherwise, her tangents can seem a bit random and winded. I learned a lot, particularly at the end, but the course required a lot of work to keep up and feel comfortable with the material. Take with reservation.","She repeatedly canceled meetings and once never showed up. Conference work repeatedly got derailed because she failed to look over my work when she said she would. Awful email communication. Unreliable in a lot of ways. I do think I learned a lot during my time with her, but mostly because I was forced to try super-hard since she wasn't helping me.","Mahaffey treats her students with an open mind and an open heart, the latter of those being something more academics could learn from. She takes literature and applies it to LIFE, and life is not all libraries. I read now with more compassion than I did before.","The class is almost entirely discussion based, so do your reading (there was a lot). I learned a little bit from the class, but she was pretty confusing when she tried to clarify concepts. BUT she was so helpful when I went to office hours. My writing improved exponentially because of her guidance.","I really don't think she's that bad.  Her class is extremely discussion heavy, so I think sometimes she sees the need to play devil's advocate to help see all sides of an issue.  It doesn't always work.  Her class is really interesting, though, and I thought paper grading was fair and helpful.  I guess I like the sheet of comments.","She writes a page of comments on papers, showing that she puts a lot of time into caring about her students and helping them to improve, but also showing that she assumes you value her opinion and want her advice even though you didn't ask for it. Basically, you'll love or hate her based on whether you think she's caring or pretentious.","Professor Mahaffey is an extremely conscientious educator, interested in her students both as academics and individuals. She's a brilliant professor and makes the classroom a comfortable setting to explore new ideas. She will push the boundaries of your intellect and encourage your wholehearted engagement with the texts.",Awful. Wouldn't take another class with her.,"She is pretentious and underestimates her students to the point where it becomes impossible for anyone to engage in an interesting discussion. She seems nice and caring enough, but I really don't feel that I got anything out of her class.","It's not that Mahaffey doesn't care about her students--she does. But her teaching style is horrible! She may be incredibly intelligent but she is also condescending, intimidating and always disappointed in her students.","I really enjoyed this class. She cares about discussion in class, so you need to speak up a little, but she keeps the discussion interesting.","She is a brilliant professor and she does a good job of keeping your attention.

He is extremly unhelpful, thinks everything he says is true, and only gives you full credit if you give him exactly what he said. He posts stuff online so coming to class won't really help you all that much. AVOID HIM!","Maher can be a very difficult teach, if you do not attend lecture and pay attention.  If you do, the case is easy to pass and to receive a good grade.  He will give you the exact quiz questions, all you need to do is go to class.","Straight up, the guy is nuts. Avoid.","Professor is convinced that every word that he utters is the truth, in blatant disregard to any dissenting opinion. Class is not worth the effort - has very little to do with science and more to do with **** passed off as ""science"" with the exception of a few works.

I took ANTH423, which was economic anthropology, which is a very unique topic. There were ALOT of readings, papers, tests, and books to finish also.

He's such a sweet old man and african film and society 266 is a really easy class. The class is super straight forward so you won't really need his help for a lot but simply conversing with him is great. i HIGHLY recommend his class because he's awesome!,"Fantastic. He is funny and warm. class was interesting and his research area is truly unique. People that don't like him tend to be Chicago frat/sorority people who never want to leave ""white"" society and have no interest in travel (Unless to Western Europe) or the humanities.","On one hand he's a funny old man who kind of looses his head some times, and on another hand he's a difficult grader.  While he does give opportunities to retake some exams, he's not likely to tell you what was wrong with your responses other than it wasn't what he wanted.","Horrible, and always on a power trip, Mahir Saul is the worst professor at the university (or has to be). He and his TA Talya don't care about the students, and their quizzes are often unreasonable. The readings are long, boring, useless and painful. Sitting through class is one of the worse experiences you'll ever have, I guarantee it.",He was an awful teacher! He did not answer questions and could not have cared less about the students. He likes the topic but he could not care less if you understand it. He also makes many mistakes. You have to read a lot for this class and even if you do it will not help with the many pop quizzes.,"One of the worst prof.s I've had. Definitely does not care about students individually, not willing to explain his reasoning behind a grade, just not helpful. Two thumbs down.","The readings (too much, I thought) and his lectures are redundant and he slips up a lot. But I thought it was an interesting class. I rarely did the readings but it was an easy class (I got a 96% overall) with take home exams. He said he'd give pop quizzes but never did besides one which he told us about beforehand.","Professor Saul was well versed in the subject (the jewish sepharad) Didn't know anything about the subject going in, but I got alot out of it. The readings range from 20 to 40 pages a class, which isn't alot to ask for since it is a 200-level course in college. Many people didn't do the readings so did worse on take home test.Overall,good professor","I was excited for this class but as it turned out, the readings were terribly long and boring. The prof droned on aimlessly (totally unprepared), did not seem to know a lot on the subject (he even said this a few times) and made sweeping generalizations about Muslim cultures. I attended every lecture and got an A+ but hardly learned anything.","One of the worst profs I've ever had.  You could tell he was unprepared because he came to lecture everyday and rambled for 50 minutes without really teaching anything.  If you did attend lecture (which was required), you didn't need to read the assigned ethnographies though because he told us exactly what would be on the exams, so exams were easy.","Very intelligent &amp; well-versed in subject matter; humorous, entertaining, witty. Recommended. Caveat: his focus of study is African cultures, so course content will be Afrocentric. 230 subject matter wasn't so great  - more African microeconomics than ethnographic method, &amp; the TA was BEYOND HORRIBLE.

She inspires curiosity in me and I have learned a lot about Classical Mechanics from her.,Prof Makins is absolutely amazing and I definitely recommend taking her class. it does require hard work keeping up with and understanding the material but Makins is really inspiring and made me appreciate classical mechanics more.,"There is no other professor better than her in the physics department, period.  For a challenging course such as 325/6, you will need her insights. She is the one who truly teaches the physics behind and builds the whole of classical mechanics from ground up.","Her clear knowledge and enthusiasm makes lecture very enjoyable. While lecture is not mandatory I would highly recommend going, she explains things much better than a textbook can. HW is weekly and is challenging but it prepares you well. All together probably the best professer I've had.","Best teacher I've had. Hard, but curves at the end  (lot of A's and B's and some C's). Well designed and guided courses. Great board work, great at building intuition of hard subjects, cares about students. Considerate towards students and exam scheduling. Encourages ""stupid questions"". Inspired me to understand things intuitively. I could go on","Absolutely amazing! Her lectures are always intellectually stimulating and funny, and I enjoyed every minute of it! For 325, I don't know about prof Weaver, but you can't go wrong with Naomi!","Just an awesome person, the kind of prof who's lecture you always genuinely want to go to. If you're  in physics she is the prof you want. Also very nice and willing to answer just about any question, as well as to learn your name.",I'm an exchange student and I think that one of the thinks that I have liked most are her lectures. The lectures are clear. She spends much time in trying to explain everything correctly and with a good taste of humor. She has to much energy to do a lot of things in a such short time. There is no boring class with Naomi.,She stands for the definition of wisdom of mankind and beauty of science.,"Naomi is... strange.  You will love her as a person.  As a professor... not so much.  Unless you are one of those people who are very, I mean VERY, passionate about physics, you will struggle... hard.  The homework is near impossible without going to Sunday office hours or cheating.  Lecture feels like she is reteaching herself, not the class.",Professor Makins is the best professor I have ever met!,"I loved her for 225 but for 325 her performance is...lacking. The class is so disorganized, it feels as if she hasn't prepped for anything at all. Homework and discussion packets are made on the fly and often feel useless and she's not even covering topics that are essential to classical mechanics. I really regret taking this class with her.","I wish she would teach every physics class I have to take. She's just simply that good. There's no way you're not understanding what shes teaching if you attend lectures. Only negative part being you don't get your grades back on time always, but I've never had to worry about that cos she's always willing to help you out.",Worst professor ever!!! Try to avoid her as much as possible. She didn't take her class serious at all. Spent a lot of time on trivial things. Her lecture was not well organized and confusing. The worst teacher of all time!!
2097471,2.7,Korinta,Maldonado,5,0.49384023327434495,She's smart but a little disorganized. Pay attention and you learn. One of my best classes ever.,"I am not lying when I say that she is the worst professor I've ever had. Her prompts for the essays and her way of talking in general were wordy, ambiguous, and confusing, she failed to update grades correctly, and gave us an old syllabus from a previous semester with different assignments and without a grading scale. Avoid her at all costs.",Show up to class and you'll get an A. If you do all the work it's easy to get a very high grade.,Kora was the most unorganized teacher I've had. She had no curriculum and your grade was basely purely on whether or not she liked you. I would highly recommend switching out of her class if you find yourself in it. The corse seemed fine towards the beginning but went downhill from there.,"Nice lady, but this class was completely disorganized and very, very confusing. Expect vague, confusingly-worded prompts for essays, a syllabus that changes in significant ways weekly, and little concrete help. We never received credit for much of the work we did during the semester- the bulk of your grade is based off of 4 essays."

616271,3.8,Farhad,Malekafzali,68,0.5308627675667655,Farhad is an absolutely amazing professor and the UO will suffer greatly without his knowledge. Having a teacher from the region of the world in which you are discussing benefits the subject in a number of ways. Professor Farhad has a plethora of knowledge on the subject of ME politics and did a great job in explaining these complexities to us.,"Farhad is the man. By far the best professor in the political science department at Illinois. Teaches the stuff how it should be taught, not edited for textbooks. Yes, his class is hard, but you will come away from his class knowing the real side of a topic. Illinois will be at a loss if he leaves. Take his class for the material, not for the grade","Professor Malekafzali is far and wide my favorite professor at UIUC.  He is incredibly intelligent and will provide facts to back up his stance if you disagree.  His tests are hard but manageable, do the readings and attend every lecture.  I have never had a problem meeting with him to discuss papers, either, he is  pretty approachable.","Prof. Malekafzali is by far my favorite professor on campus.  I've taken two classes with him.  You can tell he is passionate about what he teaches.  Attendance is not mandatory but I highly suggest you go!  He doesn't put any of his lectures up.  Keep up with the readings! Take a class with him if you can, before he leaves!","The best professor I have had at this school. He may seem intimating at first, but he is very passionate about his lectures and is always helpful when you see him outside the classroom. Readings are  mandatory and even though attendance isn't I would not recommend missing any!! Go into his classes open-minded and you will have an amazing experience","Classes I took with professor Malekafzali (PS 300 and 304) were the most worthwhile classes that I've taken at U of I. I learned so much from his lectures, and I respect and admire his passion for the subject and professionalism he showed in every class.He made me feel that I am really learning about something that I should be learning in college.","Re Eval below: you seem bothered by how popular he is. So, you know better than the other twenty students in class and you know the topic better than both the prof and all the wide ranging readings. That's quite a stench for someone as limited as you obviously are.",Very knowledgeable and passionate in what he teaches. Provides great information and isn't afraid to defend his stances.  Tests are fairly easy: matching; multiple choice; and an essay. Only recommendation is that you do the reading because it's NEVER discussed in class on shows up on the exam in the form of an essay questions (guaranteed) a few mc,"As far as professors go, he is INTENSE. But he is also very knowledgeable and passionate about what he teaches. Class attendance is not officially mandatory, but if you want to pass you need to go every class. He is very nice and very accommodating to his students. You will learn a lot in his class as long as you do the reading and pay attention",I'm a senior and I can unequivocally say that he is one of the best professors on campus. All PS majors owe it to themselves to take this class. While it can drag on a little bit (3 hours everyone Wednesday when I took it) you don't really feel it since the material is really interesting and evokes a lot of participation and debate.,"I really enjoyed both classes I took with prof. Malekafzal. He is a fantastic teacher and I learned an enormous amount. When people ask if they should take his classes, I always warn them they are challenging but they will undoubtedly learn more than in any other class they could take. It has been a pleasure learning from Dr. Malekafzali.",Irrevocably changed my views of the Middle East. Enroll if you want to take away something OTHER than a letter grade.,"I was afraid to take a class with him at first, he comes off pretty scary the first day but I ended up loving the class. Taking notes and going to lecture are pretty much necessary but his exams aren't bad. I think he's kind of funny","If you do the work, pay attention, take notes and show some respect it will pay off.  I learned a lot, and ended up liking him.","Please don't be so intimidated that you don't take this class, because I learned a lot.  He may be opinionated, but he's passionate and hilarious.  He has a very clear outline for his lectures that is easy to follow.  Just make sure you take notes on the readings to study!","Really smart guy, interesting material, but a bit dry.  Maybe it's because laptops aren't allowed.  Start early on the paper!","i consider a professor someone who takes the job seriously, enjoys teaching the material he or she loves with a passion and seeing his students succeed and share the passion as well. something this professor clearly does not have, he knows his stuff but that is about it","Farhad goes into a lot of detail and has an obvious passion for political science, but the downside of that is everything he says seems important. What he says is clear, but you it's not easy to figure out which things you should study for exams.","Some people understandably find it difficult to stomach the fact that he has a funny name. I did not find the class 'biased' at all. Even if it was, it is PS class so surely it would not have been the only one that was. It is funny how some are happy to overlook every other aspect of the class because the professor was perceived to be opinionated.","The reading assignments dont always correlate about what he lectures on, like he would assign a chapter in one of the three books to read, but he already covered the content two weeks ago in lecture. The exams are difficult, and theres no study guides. Arrive on time, or he'll yell at you infront of everyone! He has an intimidating presence"
1899416,4.3,Theo,Malekin,8,0.5954966952874418,"Really passionate &amp; eccentric professor. Had him for Myth, Murder, &amp; Madness. Read really interesting books that aren't super well known, so I really liked the class. Participation &amp; attendance is key to your grade. There were a couple easy small papers &amp; a long research based final paper.",Pretty cool. Learned about Scandinavia and Sweden. Malekin is very helpful. Readings are pretty easy because they're mostly novels BUT it is important to come prepared for discussion. Class is open forum rather than lecture so come prepared.,"Great professor! Sometimes seems like the absent-minded professor, but he is very engaging and enthusiastic about the subject matter he's teaching. Gives thorough answers and points out interesting moments in the literature. Expectations for assignments aren't super clear, but he an clarify if you are confused.",A very solid professor. I was very interested in the material and enjoyed reading and the class was pretty straightforward because of that. There's a few papers and things but the grading is very fair. A couple straightforward group projects but nothing crazy. Overall a solid teacher and interesting class.,"Great guy, his tests are fair and his class is really interesting",Responsible and passionate professor. His English accent is very impressive! Theo is very knowledgeable and always willing to help. The exams or papers are not difficult at all as long as you go to the lecture and do the readings. Don't be afraid to ask him questions because he is very patient. He doesn't like students to be late tho.,"Summer S1: Be prepared to read 20+ pages each day. Genuinely interested in the subject matter, and knows a lot about mythology. Ask a question and he'll spend 10 min telling you everything he knows about the topic enthusiastically. Exams are fair. Replies to emails within 24 hrs. Take good notes, he doesn't post lectures. Lovely professor, imo!","Very interesting class with only a moderate amount of readings.  Discussions were interesting as well.  The 2 exams are graded harshly, and the final paper is inconveniently assigned during finals.  Can be rude/lose his temper easily if he gets upset, which happened a few times.  Just study harder than you think you need to and you'll do well."

1930999,3.7,Ripan,Malhi,7,0.5347112741390098,I had him for 3 classes. He's very understanding and able to explain in clear terms. also very patient.,"Lots of homework but thats because there are no exams. To get an A, read the instructions carefully and don't miss assignments. I loved this class and it was so easy as long as you stay diligent and actually put some thought in the discussion posts.",Best class I had all year,We read articles on paleogenomics in the course. The research we discussed was very interesting.,This online class was the hardest ever! It is also intense because it is four credit hours.,Interesting class,Dr. Malhi is extremely intelligent and interesting to listen to. But he is very monotone and it's so hard to stay attentive for an hour and a half. The quizzes had difficult questions that were unfairly worded and he would not give credit for them.
1943158,4.5,Jackie,Malinowski,7,0.6628302444845932,"Lectures are not bad. There were occasional timed reading quizzes online. Labs were pretty difficult and time-consuming. Everything looks like rocks to someone who is not interested in such artifacts. Lab quizzes were hit or miss. Not sure what I expected from course, but can't complain. Jackie  easygoing; TA  hard grader. An okay GenEd.","Jackie was probably the best professor I had at Illinois. Her classes are super fun to attend, and being a civil engineer, I got a chance to see soil and rocks from a very different perspective. I would highly recommend every one of her courses.",Perfect prof. Love her.,"Dr J. is by far one of the best professors I've ever had at this university. GEOL 208 has a medium work load, but if you show up to class and do your work is should be an easy A. Would highly recommend any class she teaches.","Very heavy workload, including four problem sets, weekly lab session, one closed-book midterm, one term paper, two field trips and one closed-book finals (non-cumulative), but gives some extra credits (three Geology seminar notes and some extra lab works, both very time-consuming). Please do give a second thought when deciding to take this course.","Everyone loves Jackie! She's funny, friendly, and makes class more lively than many other professors. Her tests can be decently hard, but if you study you'll be fine. She has her students' best interest in mind. Definitely my favorite professor at UIUC so far. Glad I have her again this semester!","Jackie is really good at explaining geological concepts in details. She's really patient in class to answering students' questions and in her office hours. Her tests can be tricky sometimes but they were fair. Just study up and take a lot of time reviewing the geological time scale. Also, do the extra credit!! They really help to boost your grade."
1950801,4.6,Cary,Malkiewich,6,0.5176828081236142,"Fantastic professor. Malkiewich's class is very well organized; I've never had to scramble for information like in other math classes. He is also very good at answering questions, and really can open up your mind to math.  415 is dumbed down compared to the full linear algebra course 416, so if you're going to grad school, I'd take 416 instead.","This guy is awesome!  He is very enthusiastic about Linear Algebra, and it really helps make the lectures interesting and useful.  He answers questions very thoroughly, and is very helpful toward anything you would need.  Even though the class uses power-points he still tries to do enough work on the board to clarify the concepts.  Take him!!!","I didn't know it was possible for someone to love Linear Algebra so much. He nerds out and it makes lectures that much more fun. However,  I found this course to be beyond difficult, the opposite of what I had heard. I was in four other technical engineering courses and this was by far the hardest. Exams were VERY conceptual and tricky.","This class is pretty straightforward, and it is easy to fall behind because of how little of an impression the class makes. However, make sure to do the homework and never put it off, and you will be in good shape for an A in the class.","He is super-friendly, very approachable, and humble. He goes through the lecture very slowly and tries to relate it the students. His lectures are amazing! He has so much enthusiasm and makes tough concepts approachable and fun. He clearly has passion for teaching and I feel he cares about the students. Will miss this teacher!","Prof. Malkiewich is  new at UIUC, but  he is THE professor to take if you are planning to go to  grad school, especially if your interest is in AlgebraitcTopology! The class itself is not easy, so he offers additional office hours when he feels students need it. No extra credit. Good curve. Handsome. Conclusion: you will work hard but will enjoy!"
