2232326,3.5,Michael,Haberman,4,0.605234677446815,Class is demanding but very fair;  you'll learn a lot if you never programmed before; definitely worth taking if you want to find out more about computers,"Arguably the best professor I've had thus far at UIUC. Knows his stuff, and is very engaging, kind, and cool. Very eager and able to help whenever a student needs it. He even made me want to switch from business into CS. Makes computer science fun, easy to learn, and though-provoking.","Prof. Haberman; definitely a nice guy, but his class is so frustrating. Only one lecture a week, which is an hour and a half but could be summed up in about 5 minutes. No textbook, hardly any resources except to hunt down your TA all the way across campus during their 1 hour a week office hour. Hardly any ways to seek effective help for class.","He knows what he's talking about, but he mumbles, almost never uses his mic in a lecture of 450 people, and doesn't really wait to make sure everyone's on the same page. Very hard to follow, but I've learned so far. People around you are loud, and you gotta make sure you're listening to him. He's still a good prof, but yeah."

He is an incredibly interesting guy if you get to know him at all and he really cares about teaching the subject material. I couldn't recommend him more.,"I did not learn anything from lecture. I had to teach myself everything. The material increased in difficulty fast so this was hard but manageable. If you are coming into this class thinking it is going to be easy, you are wrong and have to be ready to put a lot of work in. Read the textbook and do the example problems in there to learn.","Consistently shows up to class 5 to 10 minutes late. Mutters, difficult to follow what he's doing on the board, and has barely legible handwriting. You'll have an easier time learning the material by teaching yourself out of the book and attending TA office hours.","On both of the mid terms, one of the forms will have a question that is either ""impossible to solve"" or just harder. So half the class gets unfair points. He also will say ""there won't be a question on this material on this exam"" and half of the exam's points will come from that material.  Talks to the board, isn't engaging. Wouldnt recommend.","He said that he wouldn't put a certain problem type on the midterm, but ended up putting it on anyways, telling us he would give us partial credit if we at least attempted it. I attempted &amp; lost all points, bringing me down from an A to a B. I just think that's pretty unfair. At least there is a curve. Not a big one though. sigh.","Poor preparation, poor lecture performance. Since there are pretty many lecturers for MATH 285, I really recommend that students pick up other's sections.","You have to teach yourself the material in this class. Prof. Haboush seems unprepared and disorganized during class, so the lecture isn't very engaging or helpful. The exams are difficult (most people didn't finish), but the results are curved, so the overall difficulty was tolerable for me.","I got a good grade in this class, but has to teach myself everything. He is embarrassingly unprepared. Doesn't proof read the tests until you're taking them, so he'll announce half way through that there is an issue. He makes many mistake in lecture. Try and take with anyone else.","This guys is probably one of the worst teachers I have ever had. He just talks into the board not explaining anything, and makes mistakes left and right. He is completely unorganized, never clarifies what will be on exams and doesn't respond to emails. He doesn't even take the time to provide practice exams. This guy does not deserve to teach","Just a horrible professor. Talks aimlessly during lecture, gets lost in his own work, and does proofs that don't matter for tests. His tests are graded very hard, and he'll take forever, if at all, to get them back. Take someone else!","Every time I go to the class, I see two kinds of people: one with question mark on their head, and the other with fingers scrolling on the screen of smartphones... even though I tried to understand his lectures, he screws everything up by writing LOTS of equations he fails to explain... IF YOU CAN'T AVOID HIM THEN DONT TAKE THE CLASS!!","This guy shows up consistently late to his own class, sometimes not even showing up at all.  His ""teaching"" method looks more like he is trying to prove that he knows a subject than actually explain it.  Does not prepare problems for lecture and usually screws up when making them up on the fly.","Just brutal. Fumbles around the entire lecture on the board, and manages somehow to neither teach the basics of diff eq nor give useful examples. Midterms were too lengthy and tedious. Avoid avoid avoid","This dude is a joke. There are 4 questions on the second midterm, and he found 6 mistakes while we were doing it. I rated interest to attending classes as 2 points simply because I am a person who like to see jokes","I came into this class quite familiar with Linear Algebra and walked out possibly worse off than I entered. Haboush is a brilliant man, however he could not teach even if his very life depended on it. I read the reviews on here before taking the class and just shrugged them off thinking ""can't be that bad..."" Let me just say.. I was very very wrong","This class just makes me laugh. Pretty much the worst case scenario here when it comes to a math teacher anywhere. Always does proofs, NEVER examples, and never makes anything relevant to the audience he's trying to teach. Grading system is bad, you compete with others for grades. Tests literally seem like they were written 5 minutes before class.","Worst math professor I've ever had. He taught as though the class already knew the material, he spent all his time on proofs that weren't on any exam, and he never seemed to have prepared anything before class: he was always wasting time making algebra mistakes. And on the final, he said that sigma wouldn't be zero, but it was: 1/0. Just great.","Haboush is obviously an intelligent guy, but not a good teacher by any means. Spends class time doing proofs that won't help you in the class. I still thought it wasn't hard to get a good grade considering the class before an exam he tells you exactly what kind of problems will be on it. I taught myself from the book and got an A in the class.","NO. If you are reading this, then you obviously care somewhat about your grades. Go out of your way to not take Haboush. By far the worst teacher I have ever had. Consider yourself warned."

Smartest move she made was inviting guest speakers.",No Comments,"BY FAR THE WORST professor I have ever had at this university.  Her lectures were horrible, she insulted the class on a daily basis..avoid at all costs!","By far the worst instructor I have ever had in my academic career.  She is lazy, makes test questions tricky on purpose, she makes quizzes that are two questions each question is worth 50 points and it is two multiple choice or true false questions, she is lazy and in general she sucks. Do not take any of her courses I hope she gets fired!","I would not even consider her as a teacher, she claims she is a black scholar, all she is an activist, she has no idea how to teach, the exams are worth 30% of the grade and there only 25 questions, she is the laziest ""professor"" on campus, she deserves to be fired.  DO NOT TAKE ANY COURSE SHE TEACHES.",Do not go into this class thinking it is an easy gen. ed.  This has been my hardest class because of the fact that what she states in lecture gets mis-worded on the tests.  Laughs about trick questions.  Cancels class or has T.A.s administer quizzes so that she does not have to be there.  Knows how to speak; doesn't know how to write tests. Beware,"nothing to learn, TA's are terrible, class average is below 60%, professor does not care about students, I have no idea why I clicked 'register' button in the beginning of the semester.","The worst professor that i've ever had! she doesn't care about the students. this is a 100-level class, and on the first exam 70% of the class failed it. her, and the TA's are worthless. was never there to answer questions or help anyone.

It was hard to be motivated or be comfortable in class bc not only his comments are harsh but they were destructive due to his lack or relationships w/ students. I found myself in a big slump or failure mode many times.","i had kevin for a 5week communication design class. i was never motivated to go to class because i didnt find the projects helpful or interesting. he never told you what your grade was on anything, and not always positive in helping you do better/achieve your best final product of a project.","He gave strict limitations and no inspiration for projects. He also gave no feedback on our progress of grades. At the end of the semester, I found out I did not do very well, even though I tried my best.","He gave no feedback on grades, but he was a pleasant person."

Lectures are useless, critiques can be helpful but sometimes not. Best quality is his willingness to let you experiment and do your work how you wish. Overall great professor for a first year studio.",He is a good guy. Very kind and cares about his students.,He is a great professor and really wants his students to understand the material being taught. Take the time during studio and go to his office and get to know him. its worth it.,He was a very helpful and nice guy. He would take the time every class to make sure students were doing okay in their projects and learned everyone's name quickly. He is 100 times better than professor warren.,He is very nice and learned everyones name very fast. He also is very helpful,"Paternal figure who knows a lot about design/aesthetics. His 272 course his helpful for architects: high relevance. But can be vague due to his use of aesthetic jargon. Overall, he cares, which is preferable to Warren's apathy.","Good guy, kind of a paternal figure. reminds me of ned flanders. OBSESSED with paper quality and line. Not extraordinarily helpful, but the class is pretty easy if you turn your assignments in on time.",He grades unfairly. He like the old fashion type of art. His lectures are sooo boring. His assignments are useless and boring. He likes very big scale of work so that I spent so many money on printing. I learned nothing in his class.,"First of all, Hamlin, as far as i know teaches soph level students that are learning the basics of design. this is what he does, he gives you the foundation that guides you in designing actual architecture in the future. and he does this well, he knows his stuff, and this is why the school hired him","first, let's clear some things up. this man is not a professor; he has no architectural degree. he is merely a printmaster **** that licks the shoes of his fellow professor, PJ. he grades unfairly, and should not grade ar all since he is not accredited. i hate him with an inexplicable passion.","this man is a JOKE to the archiectural teaching profession.  he doesn't even have an architectural degree, and he teaches students it.  a joke to a school that is supposed to be well ranked in architecture. anything he tells yu should be disregarded because he will probably have the complete opposite opinoin next time he sees your project.",He's a great guy and a pretty good teacher but he likes to give out a lot of projects in a small amount of time.,No Comments

The projects are usually pretty fun and informative and bill is a lot of fun. however, I didn't really learn a lot that I feel will be useful to me","Awesome lecturer.  Engaging and funny.  He came into office hours a few times and was great. You can tell he really does enjoy working with students.  However, exams were incredibly difficult compared to material covered in class. But hey, that's just part of being an engineer.  Overall I recommend him.","horrible class. handouts were almost never uploaded online before the class, but in the policy he told us to print them before class. Exams are not related to how well you study, Extremely hard. Before the final we are told the final is multiply choice, but one day before final he said the questions are short answer question. what he is thinking?!","Dr. Hammack is a very good professor when it comes to lecturing, but beyond that things go wrong.  The class is highly disorganized, the professor is very detached from the students, and grades received on exams are seldom related to how much time was spent studying or learning the material.  Alas, it is what it is.","Lecture was fine, but a bit boring. The exams were horrible. I know all the material and knew how to do all the practice exams, however, the exams given were something completely different from what was taught. Horrible professor, try not to take the class if possible.",Very funny and engaging. Tells great stories that pertain to engineering. The subject is hard but he makes it understandable and enjoyable. I wish he was teaching the next course.,Loved this class. It's awesome. Take it.,Great class.,easy gen ed. good teacher. liked the class!,"This is the best class ever! Not only is the class easy, but its a lot of fun. If you have a good group, the class is a blast. The projects are straight-forward and there is no out of class work besides some simple readings. Hammack is the man!","So glad i took this class, if you can get in, do your self a favor and take it! Classes are fun laid back, often classes get canceled or let out early. Most the class is reading tests and group projects you do in class. not much you have to do but you get alot out of it. GREAT Prof!",This is the easiest science gen ed on campus and no one knows about it.  Quizzes are relatively easy and based on a 40pg reading packet.  Most of your grade is dependent on group projects.  Hammack is awesome and most of the time we were let out a half hour early.  Take this class if you can get in!!!!!,"What can I say, William Hammack is the man. Take this class. You learn about VCRs, iPods, and ball bearings. There are some readings, but the quizzes are a joke, and a lot of the grade is based on group work done in class. No final.",Easiest physical science gen ed you can ever take. No hw except for readings for assessments. No final. No textbook just a course packet he hands out in the beginning. All work is done in groups. You'd be lucky if you can get this class.,I can not begin to put into words how easy this class is. About half of the Illinois football and basketball team is in it. Literally about 5-10 minutes of homework a week. The entire reading for the semester consists of a 40 page packet. I honestly had harder classes in 5th grade. Defines Blow off

Be sure to keep up with workload throughout semester to maximize feedback and improvement.",Great technical and architectural knowledge,So knowledgable in the field!,"As a professor for a senior Capstone studio, one would expect the professor to be very helpful and knowledgeable in his particular field of study. Although somewhat knowledgeable, this is not evident in most of the advice given to students. Very pretentious, at times condescending, very confusing, and did not allow students to give course feedback.",very uninterested in student reviews. Made review atmosphere uncomfortable by interrupting presentations and calling disproportionate attention to aspects of projects that were not of importance to projects.

It can be a little intimidating at first but the class is all about how you improve as an artist.","Not easy if you don't show effort. His class is very heavy on personal improvement and artistic development. He brings in many different topics and gives you artists to follow based on work. Assignments are fun and challenging, and he leaves a lot to your own interpretation. I did not have that many portfolio pieces but the ones I have are strong.","He doesn't critique student's work but them as people, and lacks direction completely. The first 2 months where devoted to mixing paint and making sketches that were hung in the hall (he had no clue who made what) the 3rd devoted to making four canvas, (we ended up using one). He is also cruel, making everything personal ,  openly mocking students","Wastes a lot of time talking and constantly repeats the same thing over again. If you don't take his suggestions, he considers it in your grades, however, if you suggest something to him, he won't change. I don't mind working hard for my grade but he's fickle with grades to begin with. He tries to motivate you by lowering your grade. No.","If you are looking for an easy ride, steer clear. If you are appreciate a challenge and really want to improve as an artist, don't hesitate. Workload was huge, but I received great feedback, learned a ton, and really improved.

She showed a clear passion for the subject matter and was always willing to share her expertise. Be prepared to read, but also to learn a vast amount in a short amount of time. She and the rest of the SCAN department made a huge impact on my undergraduate experience.","She was my TA for CWL 241, and she was one of those good ones who was okay with you being late every week if you were dumb and scheduled classes too far apart to make the commute in ten minutes. That being said, you definitely wanted to be there, not only for the grade, but because the discussions were so interesting.","Really great instructor. English as my second language, it is kind of tough to finish all the readings timely, but she encouraged us to ask questions and were really helpful in answering them.","this class is very interesting to explore global perspectives.  And, Anya did her best to help us.  She is very nice.",Anya is an amazing TA! She is very knowledgeable and dedicated. She leads great discussions about the texts and is very good at getting students to think critically. I learned a lot from her and took a lot away from the class.

She is helpful and gives good feedback!,"Anya is enthusiastic, so it's easy to pay attention and learn the material.",She had no probably leading and guiding a class through the course. She came in well planned and was never showed any signs of distress or being disorganized. She was also a fair grader and made herself very approachable for questions. It was a pleasure having her as a teacher.,"Very natural in front of students and easy to learn from.  You can tell Anya is passionate about her work and does a great job engaging the class in meaningful discussions that spark you to seriously consider the topics.   Captivating the audience, her lectures do not end they run out of time.  Anya possesses a rare, indefinable quality.  True gem.",Facilitates discussion extremely well. Very good at relating to what excites you in the material. Also an objective grader who gives tough and helpful feedback. I always enjoyed going to class.,Anya Hamrick was very engaging during discussions and really tried to get everyone involved.  She remembered my name after the first week we had discussion which I thought was incredible but also it made me felt good as a student.  She knows the material well and asks questions that engage students to think at a higher level.,"Really, really helpful. Some of the most coherent and well put together classes I've had.","Anya was a great TA. Although I wasn't always interested in the topics, she kept me engaged. She made everything very clear and made sure we were ready for exams.  You could tell she was very passionate about what she taught.",Anya is very engaging and good at getting group participation out of a discussion class.,"This class was one of those classes where I had to try a bit more because history and reading were some of my weaknesses. Anya made all the assignments very clear, took time to explain the assignments and took time to go over things that were not clear to use that would be on the exams.","Anya is in my opinion an exceptionally good teacher and lecturer. In fact, she would always be passionate and engaging in teaching those classes of Russian literature, along with the more technical lectures of grammar. Being an engineering major I seriously wish I took more classes like that during my PhD.","She is passionate about what she teaches. Also she is always helpful; she clarifies things that might be confusing to her students. If you read the book and participate during class, you will do well in your exams and will love the class",Anya was extremely helpful and always prepared. She encouraged class participation to make sure students understood the material.,Anya was a great TA. This class was not an essay A but if you put in the work asked there should not be a reason why you would not do well in this class. She was very informative.

His lectures are very boring and slides are too cluttered. Many people don't even attend class!  I respect his reputation and knowledge. But, as a student, this class has not been a good experience.","Professor Han is awesome. He's a big deal in data mining, and he's good at explaining the concepts, although sometimes how he writes his explanations and problems is slightly ambiguous. He's a super nice guy and his enthusiasm for the subject mixed with his accent and demeanor make him kind of charming and unintentionally funny. Would recommend.","He is probably the most famous person in data mining field, very fluent in English which is quite unexpected. Everything was good...until the midterm where few students were cheating and he did nothing. This event happened again in Final exam. Seriously? What is the point of being the most famous person in the field if his students cheat to get A?","Excellent at teaching, and surprisingly good at English. Famous at data mining field. Probably easiest class to cheat during the mid term and final exam, because there is only 1 proctor for both cases. (for midterm, He was the only one proctoring 120 students) Actually saw few students cheating, which makes it just unfair for everyone. Sad truth."

If I could. Very helpful. super patient. 5 stars is too less !!,"Great professor! He was enthusiastic and presented the material in a way that was interesting to the students, and always on the students' side. As this is an ECE course, the tests are unfairly difficult, but it curves out properly at the end and the homework is very reasonable.","Extremely enthusiastic and patient. Definitely on the students side, but the course was just restructured and he was working w/2 other profs and he was the new guy, so where he would've given points back, the others didn't let him.  Tests were stupidly hard for the same reason. Super happy guy. Used a fishing pole instead of a laser pointer (what?)","I loved his lectures, however I did not find them mandatory for success in the course.  Exams were difficult, but homework was reasonable.","Pros: Decent professor. Cares and knows a lot about the subject, and is also aware of the fact that he is teaching an electrical engineering class to non-EEs. Homework isn't bad either.

Dr. Hanks is a great, very down-to-earth professor who uses dry humor and anecdotes to spice up his lectures. Exam material is taken directly off the lecture slides, so there are no surprises when it comes to exams as long as you study. 10/10","Great professor who makes learning fun. It seems almost too easy, but at conferences later I found myself using what I learned from the courses I had with him. His jokes are groan-worthy, but they get a chuckle and help you remember the material.","Grades are not posted online at all. You won't be able to find out what you have in the class unless you ask the TA.  Exam material are from the lecture but try using Quizlet for studying because they will save your life. Hanks is an excellent teacher, he knows his stuff but the class experience is poor.","not on track with schedule. Labs do not correspond to lecture. Bug collection is now mandatory when it used to be extra credit. No grades posted online. For lab, family names and order down to the spelling! This class is just memorizing. Hanks is a nice guy but not a good speaker. You can barely hear him.",Excellent professor. One of my favorites,"He is really chill, informative, and funny. This is a great class to wake up to in the mornings. Sometimes you can catch him slipping in quotes from his younger brother, THE Tom Hanks. The class is really easy if you have any prior interest in bugs, but it is not a blow off class so dont just take it for the hell of it.","Has to be one of the most fun teachers I have ever had! He has a monotone voice, but puts in jokes and interesting tidbits which make looking at the digestive system of a cockroach exciting. His exams are super super easy. Just look out for the practicals!","Great guy-- also Tom Hanks' brother! Excellent class, great educator!",I loved this class.

I liked that she was honest and clear about expectations, had a passion for teachng about health, and wanted to get us to think about difficult issues. I am not in a health major, but wanted to take more of her classes.","She is probably the sweetest professor to have ever taught at NOSE LABS.  She did not like tests. Instead, she required us to come to class, be respectful, and answer online questions from the book once a week on black board. It was an easy A, but I also enjoyed the class.  If there is anything she wanted us to remember, it was  ""safety first.""","I like her. She's relaxed and funny, but also gets the point across. Sometimes we don't get to all of the material because so many people are raising hands to participate. She's very smart and obviously knows the content inside and out. Highly recommend jumping on the chance to taking this open/honest sexuality class with awesome prof. Thanks Lena!","I like that Lena teaches ""outside the box."" She's very adamant about experiences and what we'd take away from the course so she had involved assignments instead of tests. This was a study abroad in Australia, so I liked having free time to explore while also getting more traditional tours and lectures, and then putting it all together at the end.","Lena is super awesome and makes class interesting and fun. I took this class because I heard it was an easy A- which it is. However, you will not get an A if you don't show up to class, submit journals, or modules on time. Highly recommend this class &amp; professor.","I'm in DGS and this class is so different from all my other freshman classes. Lena has helped me think about what major to do, and possible jobs I can get in the future. The class has student presentations, which helped because I never did one before and she met with me to practice to overcome my shyness. I wish I could take more classes with Lena.","FABULOUS! This is a required master's internship class for hands-on learning. There are 3 pre-course seminars during the year leading up to the course so you aren't lost. Lena explains everything clearly, and helped me get my dream project in another city. She gives thorough feedback on (graded) drafts so that you can apply it to the final version.","Really awesome class. Once the introductory stuff is over it's usually one class a week of her lecturing, one class with a guest speaker. Midterm and final are easy, as are LearnSmart modules and journals. Take notes on the guest speakers for journals. The grades were so high in our class that McGraw-Hill threw us a pizza party. Recommend","This is a great class. Anyone who says its boring or is mad about expectations must never have attend or even talked to Lena. I sat in the back almost every lecture and still had a great time. The material is interesting, Lena is excited to be there, and homework is relevant. I like this over online option because we get guest speakers and Lena!!",Overall pretty easy class but if you have issues with your grade or anything else Lena barley helps you. You are not allowed to email and if you have class during office hours you are basically out of luck. No tests- two final projects that are easy but class is mandatory and boring.,"LOVE her. I took this as an easy A blowoff class (which it totally is) but it's the class I look forward to the most. No tests or quizzes. Midterm and final both are easy projects. As long as you show up, answer iclicker questions, and do the online modules and journal each week, you'll get an A+.","I don't care too much for the class. Attendance is mandatory. 700 points total for the grade 140 for the midterm (paper), 140 for the final (paper), 140 for in-class quizzes, 140 journals (1 due every week) 140 for the online homework (which is easy.) But this is way too much work for a 2 credit hr. class. I wish I would have taken it online.","I love, love, love her. She makes sure the class is interesting by providing videos and personal stories, along with guest speakers. She uses Compass2g more than any of my other professors and makes sure everyone is up to date and informed. I HIGHLY suggest anyone take this class, no prior knowledge is needed to enjoy it.","Alright class. I took it as a blowoff class for extra hours, but I ended up really looking forward to going to class. Lena did a great job engaging the students and she incorporates guest speakers which was a lot of fun. Would recommend.","She's such an awesome instructor and I absolutely love going to class! She has i-clicker questions every lecture, which makes going to class mandatory, but Lena makes it so interesting. Plus, she's got some hilarious stories of her own. We have occasional speakers too, which makes class interesting. Easy assignments and tests. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED :)","The material itself is already interesting, but she also has the occasional movie clips and guest speakers. You have to read the book (and pay attention to the generalizations) for the pop quizzes and tests. If you want to learn more about all of this type of information, take the class- its worth it. Good Luck!","This class makes me feel like I took a women's rights class.  She uses this class as a pedestal to preach her views about women in society when no one really cares.  Also, she randomly has these ridiculous pop quizzes that use i-clicker, however, if your i-clicker does not properly register then she assumes its your fault and you get no credit.","She's really funny! She's teaching about sex so she obviously already has everyone's attention, but she knew how to keep it. Her delivery of the information was good. Overall this class was an easy A.","SUPER FUNNY! Entertaining delivery of info, but respectful &amp; educational too. Said the FIRST DAY OF CLASS that if you were expecting a blowoff, take a DIFFERENT section. Very helpful during office hours &amp; really nice in person. Keeps a respectful class, even w/ 200 students in 1 room. Study the study guides! We never had a pop quiz in our class...","Definitely an easy A class and enjoyable too if you like to learn about sex. Her explanation is super clear. Do all the extra credit opportunities.  You will only lose a few points if you skip her lecture and missed the guest speakers and online quizzes. Her slideshows are totally based on the textbook so if you miss her lecture, read the textbook."

I always looked forward to his lectures. Hansen does a great job at clearing up material that may otherwise be incredibly pedantic. The only downside/inconvenience is that he is very slow at handing back graded material.",Professor Hansen is the best professor I have had at the University. He made me think about things  I never had and gives you a new worthwhile perspective. His class was an hour and fifteen minutes and I never felt the need to look at my phone because what he says is so compelling. Not to mention he is also hilarious. Take any class you can w/ him!,"Fantastic professor. Not gonna be the easiest class, but it'll be supremely fun. His lectures are fantastic.","Hansen is the best professorinstructorteacheretc. I've absolutely ever had. I've taken three classes with him (ENGL 301 and ENGL 455 twice with varying material) and I've loved all of them and hope to take more before I graduate next semester. He's a genius, he's quick-witted, funny, and a really quality professor. Take him every chance you get.","Professor Hansen is the best professor I've ever had. Taking critical theory with him expands your mind in so many ways and will make you a smarter person. He's very funny, and his lectures are always entertaining. He's a really nice guy, and very approachable in office hours.Take a class with him whenever you can. You won't regret or forget it.",Really great professor! This was the second class I had taken with him and I have to say I enjoyed both of them more than I had expected since I was not sure about them going into them. His comic book nerdiness was always appreciated along with his sense of humor. Take his classes whenever you can!,"I enjoy learning from Hansen. He clearly loves what he does, and although he can be slow at returning papers, you would be hard pressed to find an instructor more engaging or intelligent. Smartest person I know, not just in his field but in general. Easy to talk to, always willing to help his students. Highly recommended.","Phenomenal professor. Take his as much as you can, as often as you can. While the readings are complex, his explanations in class make them simple to understand and extrapolate from. He is, self-admittedly, atrocious at email, but is readily available in office hours and to meet by appointment. A fascinating person inside and out of class. Take.","He's hilarious, manages to teach something that in anyone else's hands be incredibly dry, boring, and tedious in a way that is relatable and easy to understand. While he is hard to reach by email, he's always available for office hours. I'm so glad I took 301 with him, as he's the only thing that makes that class worthwhile.","Speaks far too much in class, making it almost impossible to understand what information is necessary to know. Although he makes small talk by referencing his love of comic book heroes, he hardly stimulates the class to think critically. Far too much outside learning had to be done after his lectures to decipher his notes. Would not take again.","Talks entirely too much during class (especially for a 400-level one), talking points are incredibly repetitive, extremely flaky.  He does have extensive and interesting knowledge of critical theory, though.",Helpful and friendly. Makes class interesting and explains text thoroughly.,"Made a scary class fun and understandable. Very easy to relate to and very easygoing about grades, exams, and papers. Easily one of the best professors ever had.","Amazing professor! He made critical theory fun! So easy to understand it after he explains it in class, and the papers/exams were so easy. He really cares about his students, and he admitted at the beginning of the semester that you shouldn't contact him through email. Very enjoyable class! Just write 2 discussion questions and show up.",awful...seems nice in class but not helpful at all! NEVER responded to emails regarding my grade on a test. tests were so random and you had no idea what would be on there..awful!,"THOUGHT THIS CLASS WAS GONNA BE GOOD BECAUSE HE WAS SUCH A NICE AND LAID BACK TEACHER. HE DOESNT RESPOND TO EMAILS AND HE TALKS TOO MUCH DURING LECTURES, MAKING IT UNCLEAR ON WHAT TO STUDY FOR THE CLASS. VERY CONCEITED, TESTS ARE HARD. ITS NOT WORTH THE GEN ED.","A great professor! Really enjoys and knows what he teaches. Always willing to make sure his students grasp the material. Very tough but extremely fair test/papers. You must do the reading, go to class, and ask questions to do well. And you'll want to! Take at least one class with him for sure! One of the best profs I've ever had!","beckett was challenging and frustrating (maybe even useless), but hansen was a lot of fun. fair grader, workload was average, down to earth and accessible.",I'm in love w/ him!!! he's soo interesting and knowledgeable!!! He's very helpful and hilarious!!

Maryann was great, it was the prof she worked for that sucked (Karen rosenblatt).  I agree with the grading being hard, but when I went to see Maryann and she told me that she had to grade homeworks based on the prof's answers. so it wasn't her fault. And her review sessions were great, they really helped me.",She sucks as a TA!!!! Her review sessions are pointless and don't help at all for the tests so go ahead and skip them.

Grading was fair; prof was helpful in office hours (if necessarily inaccessible outside office hours due to 500 person class size). Buy a textbook! (Recommended: Algorithm Design, Kleinberg-Tardos). Struggle through the assignments solo to learn the material better.",Issues mentioned are generally overblown. Knows how to build grit.,"The course is difficult, that much is undeniable. Sariel has his weaknesses but at the end of the day he is incredibly intelligent and really provides students with the resources they need to succeed. I have much respect for him and am happy to have taken this course with his lead!",He gave horrible and tedious lectures. He was so mean to students and did not care if we got it or not. He even refused to answer questions about 374 during his office hour. Don't take his courses.,Avoid at all cost! 1)Literally the worst lecturer. Really thick accent and goes through concepts really fast without explaining in details. 2) Homework problems are really difficult to understand. Grammar errors and weird phrasings makes most students spend hours on piazza just asking for clarifications..,"He's definitely not a good lecturer. I don't know how the CS department allowed him to teach a heavy course like CS374. On the other hand, I believe he's a great guy and genius. But lecturing is definitely not a thing for him.","Awful professor. Often responds to questions with 'use your common sense'. He is impossible to understand or hear, and is generally unhelpful or unreceptive to feedback.",Most horrible class ever,"Seems to be a pretty smart guy, however his lectures are horribly difficult to hear much less comprehend, and since it's one of the hardest classes in the CS department, his horrible lecturing only makes it more unbearable.","Not a good instructor.An ultra smart guy and a brilliant researcher  yes, but not a good teacher! He assumes that you know everything, and doesn't get any feedback from the class.Doesn't answer questions.His bad accent exacerbates the problem.  His homeworks are crazy hard &amp; doesn't grade them soon enough nor gives solutions.The exams are as hard.",Har-Peled is very smart but he just doesn't speak English well enough to get his point accross.    He would also tend to delve into lengthy proofs before explaining what the problem was or why it matters.   I doubt he has ever taken and Education course in his life.   He may be a brilliant researcher but he hasn't become a good teacher (yet).

Do not take this class.","Although I hate public speaking, this class really helped me. Don was a decent professor but I didn't always enjoy how he handled things.  He called me out in front of the class multiple times to show what I did wrong. I know hearing criticism helps me but it really tore down my confidence. He never gives people JUST positive feedback.","Easy class, no textbook, everything is online. There were 6 quiz total and only 5 counts, and one final exam. All of them were easy, because he sometime does an review of the material before each quiz, which makes it clear what you are expecting on the quiz. If you love talking about sports, you would fall in love with this class and the readings.","Don is a professor worth taking a class with. We met only once a week and even though it was for close to three hours, it wasn't too bad. Weekly quizzes in class and group projects, which were surprisingly fun. Just do the work and you'll get an A","Don is an excellent professor. He really enjoys what he does. This was a ery fun class and I enjoyed it, strongly recommend!",I had Don for KIN 239 and he is one of the best professors I have ever had. He is a very personable mad and loves what he does. He does his best to make a boring class interesting by bringing in guest speakers/group presentations/giving breaks.  You need to purchase the book new because it comes with a code that you need for the final exam!,"He is by far my favorite teacher.  He makes a semi-boring class really fun! He is super helpful if you go see him or email him with a question.  For KIN 239, make sure to go to class though.  It may seem pointless at first, but he gives participation points at the end of class, so don't leave early!","Great teacher, his main focus is to teach, not ruin your GPA. He cares a lot about what he teaches and puts a lot of effort into taking a dry curriculum and making it fun. He loves to help students who go to him and are serious about the major. By far my favorite teacher"
1715674,4.0,Donald,Haring,6,0.6713259137689945,Donald Haring was not that good of a professor.  He was not understanding in the least.

Not a fun guy. Would not recommend.,"First of all (and I did not know this coming in), Mr. Haring is deaf. This means that you can only speak to him in ASL, which can sometimes be difficult. Overall, he is a really nice guy and as long as you don't get on his bad side you will do fine.","My favorite teacher I have ever had!  He was quite intimidating at first, but is so great at explaining things and making sure all the students understand the concepts before moving forward.  You still need to put in some time to study for quizzes and tests, but as long as you put in the time, you will do well!","One of the best professors I've ever had! Knows how to explain answers even better than all of my hearing teachers. Makes the class fun and makes you want to learn more. All quizzes &amp; exams are easy if you study a little. The hardest part is the Classifiers, but even then he doesn't grade too hard.",Great class and Great Instructor Learned a lot and the material was really interesting.,"Prof Haring really is an awesome professor for ASL. Class can be a little intimidating at first, but I promise you'll end up enjoying it. Haring really tries his best to make the class upbeat and fun.

Can be a tough class if you skip a lot or treat it like a blow off. If he writes something on the board write it down it will most likely be on a  test.","This man shouldn't be a teacher  advisor. Has littleno patience for students w questions, and seems to pick out favorite students from the start. Exams are tough, and even graded tougher. Only looks for his specific reasoning to questions, regardless of whether other answers may be correct.

His class has no structure-open to Qs",Awesome teacher! He is crazy helpful and engaging even though I had no desire to study philosophy whatsoever.  Interesting stories helped to keep me entertained.,"You get points for coming to class everyday. Random pop quizzes on the readings. One reading assigned per class. His tests are very fair. All written tests--both long and short essays. On the final, you apply concepts from major philosophers but only need to focus on the philosophers you read about post mid-term, which is 5-6 different readings.","I was in this class with about 35 other students.

No HW, but manageable weekly quizzes. The 3rd test is insanely hard.",very reasonable and helpful. i was having a lot of trouble with a chapter's worth of material and he took the time to re-teach it all to me,Good teacher. personable. easy to talk to. much easier to learn from at office hours than in lecture. He writes what he's doing at the same time that he's explaining what he's doing. You do not have enough time to write down the problem and how to do it.

That's what college is supposed to do:  challenge ideas and make a person think.  Yes, she has an opinion and isn't afraid to let you know what it is.

THe class take a lot of work to get an A,"He sucks, all he does for lecture is read straight from the book. His tests arent like anything he does and usually has mistakes. He is the worst teacher i have ever had.  The only reason I did ok in this class is because I watched online lectures from MIT.","Good teacher, tells you exactly what he expects you to know, very fair grade breakdown.",This professor is more concerned with his other work than acutally teaching.  He needs to spend more time preparing organized lecture notes and tests that are appropriate for the allowed time and skills to be tests.,Terrible teacher.  His lectures are disorganized and unfocused.  His notes consist of examples copied directly from the book.  His tests are silly- there were obvious mistakes and it was clear he did not complete the problems himself.  This has been the worse math class I have taken at U of I.  I expect to earn a high grade but learned nothing.,"his tests are really bad, probably because he writes the the day of or the day before.  some of the calculations were crazy for a 50 minute test.  not a fan of the webwork system. he takes almost all of his lecture notes out of the book (which is in my opinion a hard text) but a nice guy, tries to keep class interesting.","Great teacher, seems like a good guy and uses the internet to post lecture notes which is very helpful.",atleast he's got a cool australian accent...,Good teacher.  BAD HOMEWORK.  WEBWORK is evil!,"i have trouble visualizing in 3-D and the class didn't help very much in making it easier for me. the webwork almost always has a multiple choice matching question. i find these very frustrating, as it's possible to try it 50 times and still get 1 wrong because it won't tell you which one is wrong. but he tries to keep class fun, which is good :-)",He is really fun to listen to.  Very helpful in lecture.  I really like how he takes a few min at the start of class to talk about the class and where we are.,"OMG, His lectures are totally helpful, I love the australian accent and the stories in the beginning. He should do Karate more often and in class.","explains material very well in class. sometimes homework does not mesh with lecture very well, but is typically ok. makes himself very available for extra help. without a doubt the best math prof i've had here.",Professor Hart is a very good lecturer.  He is clear and he always points out where students often go wrong and makes sure that you know not to make the same mistakes.  The online homework is often too difficult for what we are taught in lecture/discussion.,"Good prof, and you can actually understand him. he is very reasonable, just don't try to pull one by him. His test are straight from the material. There is a paper that if you put a little bit extra into is an easy A. HW is not very difficult (usually under an hour)","This class is fairly easy if you go to lecture and take notes. Discussions help a lot too. Hart is Australian and a good teacher, his tests are fairly easy and come straight from homework assignments. Take notes, do the homework, study, and you're golden."

The lectures are not limited to course material, even if the programming assignments are the same every semester. The ""textbook"" for this course was written by him, and we had free access to it. On the whole, I would say this was an easy though not a trivial class.","I laughed hard when I read the prior review ""... Leaning an API is better left to man pages and google..."" This review was obviously written by the Professor himself to fend off the other reviews stating he does not teach the API, but requires its use for course projects. In fact, he made almost the exact statement during lecture.",John Hart is one of the most laid back professors I have ever seen. Yet despite his simple slides he teaches quiet well. The fact that he did not teach us OpenGL calls is good. The point of cs classes is to teach us what is going on behind the implication and how to think through problems. Leaning an API is better left to man pages and google.,"Wow, what a disappointment! You know you can't lecture when only about 25% of the students come to class - and he even made fun of those who don't attend lectures. If you think his slides are sketchy, then wait until you see the regurgitated stuff during the discussion section. OpenGL is not taught, he just relies on his ppt slides to ""teach"".","John Hart is an awesome teacher. He's a really nice and approachable guy. His slides are really terrible, so I don't recommend skipping much, but that shouldn't be a problem since his lectures are usually pretty entertaining. I would definitely take another class with him!","It's a shame that such class which covers one of the most interesting topics in CS is taught by such a terrible professor. His lecture slides are by far the worst I've ever seen, lectures are unorganized with no clear focus, and exams are probably repeated from previous semesters. He is lazy and unhelpful.

One time he even said he didnt know what was right.","really awesome teacher, and a pretty easy class as long as you do the work. a lot easier than hummel.","Professor Harwood is a really good professor.

I.E. you cannot print out practice tests, powerpoints are both locked and missing slides and information, and lecture is of course next to no help.  Bottom line he does not make it easy to learn.","Has not changed a bit over the years.

Was away several times on site visits but had great stories to tell.,Is extremely condescending and un-relenting in his self-absorbed attitude. He's extremely unapproachable and rude at best. Only take this course with him if there are NO other options.,"Hashash is an excellent professor, perhaps the best I've ever had in the CEE department. Course is difficult, but it is FAIR too which is an important distinction. He really gets you involved (HW-wise and in lectures) making it one of the more intense classes you'll take in the semester.","Attendance is mandatory, but he is a good teacher.  He is also clear during lecture and makes sure everyone understands the material before moving on.","He has a tyranical attendence policy where every unexcused absence is -5% off your final grade.  He isn't a bad teacher, but the exams vary wildly in difficulty.  The first was a joke, but the second was almost impossible.","Didn't really enjoy the class, but I thought he was alright.",He is a jerk and useless at office hours and seems to think he is the smartest person on the planet.

Unlike some professors who LOVE to hear ""their voice"" in an essay, Wail wants you to put the effort and write from a new perspective. NEVER copy from notes being discussed in class. That get's you an A- or a B+. Also, talk in class and ""appear"" like you care. You will then learn a lot.","I really like Professor Hassan! He explains everything really well and takes time to make sure you understand everything. Going to class is necessary because he doesn't post lectures online, but he says a lot of info in lectures that are helpful anyway. I would recommend him!",Very easy class. Only negative is that the notes are not posted online so you have to find a friend or go to lecture.,Doesn't post notes online so if you want them you have to attend class. Reading for every class and a short (250 word) essay due online before each class about the reading (easy to fake). Very easy tests and people share notes on compass readily.

The lectures are absolutely worthless and the professor is quite boring. I learned most of the material in discussion.

Prepare to do a lot of writing as well. She loves in-class participation. Great class if you're interested in IPE","Hastings is fantastic. Even though I knew very little about IPE going into the course, her lectures made it very easy to get a grip on the topic. BE PREPARED TO WORK. The class was focused around reading articles and writings reviews every week. Be sure to go in to office hours, as she loves when people come in to talk to her!",She is the best professor ever. You HAVE to take a class with Hastings before you graduate.,"This was her first time teaching an IPE course, but it's her world so the enthusiasm and commitment overcame the lack of experience. She's a genuinely very nice and very helpful person. I would definitely urge you to enroll if she is teaching a course you're interested in. I'd post things about the course, but they are very likely to change.","She's definitely right up there as one of the best poli sci profs at the u of i. Agree with one of the previous comments, she is like a really nice aunt. I messed up my first open book book exam (yes open book!) and still got an A-). The stuff she made us read was pretty boring, nevertheless was super nice and made everything seem interesting","Simply awesome. If only all professors at the university were as skilled as she is. I really got a lot out of the class, although I wish I put in a ton more effort. I highly recommend taking one course with her during your four years.","She clearly loves her profession. She explains well, and the class is very interactive. You actually get to know your classmates.","Rarely will you come across a professor who does this much for her students. She is great at her job, but the class is a bit unstructured and the readings are too many. But regardless, I strongly recommend this class. Who else takes you for dinners, have project 'fairs' and gives you all the time you need for assignments? *This is the GC Section*",she's like a really cool aunt. also she is always willing to work with students and shows great interest in her subject material. i make an effort to attend this class.,"She was an amazing professor, she wants you to get the best grade you can.

Foreign Aid was a great class, a lot of reading but if you do it you'll learn a lot","Two tests and a take-home final. Two papers; 2 response papers. Very lenient on deadlines.

Grades super hard &amp; in an extremely confusing manner. Don't let him fool you by saying the journal entries are ""an easy A"" because I don't know one person in our class who got an A. Avoid this teacher at all costs.","lectures are mandatory, boring, and often irrelevant. His grading systems are convoluted, and despite the amount of time he talks about them, you still get completely bamboozled by your grades. Who the hell grades something B+/C-","The most boring class I have ever taken. I signed up for his class because the topic interested me, but his dull and convoluted lecturing style made it impossible to pay attention or understand what exactly it was he was trying to teach. It's hard to get an A on the coursework unless you stop thinking critically &amp; just mimic what he says in class.","The course itself is not terrible, but the way the instructor teaches it makes the 1.5 hour long class felt super slow. There are 30-60 pages of reading every class, while he does not do reading checks, he really expects you to read it. Prof also does not allow any space of creativity on homework, if you don't follow the guideline, you lose points.","Regardless of a person's  knowledge on a topic or position, there are some people who can teach and some that absolutely should not. Unfortunately, James Hay fulfills the latter. Lectures moves at a glacial pace and never seem to have a clear point.

You only have to do a handful of the readings all semester to do well on the exams. I stopped taking notes a few weeks into the class and used lecture time to do other work on my laptop instead, but still ended up with an A.

He specifically asks students to NOT include any personal opinions or analysis in essays. Assigned readings are incredibly long and applications of these readings are vague at best. Would not recommend.","BY FAR he most boring and monotone professor on campus. He rambles on in lectures, talks very slow, and never gets to the point. His TA's don't know what is going on so they grade easily. The man is never funny, and assigns 50  pages of pointless reading every night. He dresses stylish, but doesn't know how to wear it and shouldn't be. DO NOT take.","Relied so heavily on readings that people were drowning by the end of the semester.

Granted, he's heavy on the reading and it's a bit annoying you can't pitch your own ideas in papers, but all in all he's more than okay!","the ways in which James Hay teaches this course are ridiculous and very unclear. it's really easy to get an a, just as long as you somewhat do the readings and bring a tape recorder to class so that you can regurgitate everything this man says.","I don't really understand what I've learned.  It's a boatload of reading which he believes you do.  A lot of writing, a lot of reading.",I don't think I learned a single useful thing in this class.  The readings are grueling.  Hay has a habit of asking a lot of questions about the readings and never bothering to tell the class the answer he was looking for.  Horrible professor.,"Assigns more readings than he can even cover in class. Asks you specifically to leave out your own ideas from papers and exams! Regurgitate whatever concepts you can glean from his long-winded, overly theorized lectures, and a decent grade is obtainable. Could have been interesting, but I can't tell you what this class was supposed to be about.","How this man got tenure is a mystery to me.

Most of the material you learn was covered in MCB 150 and IB 150, and the lectures are extremely straight forward, yet the tests are impossible. The tests may seem easy, but my best grade was a C. The grading was not clear. Also the TA's were all awful, treated me like a 5 yr. old","Dr. Heath was a good professor. Sometimes the lectures could be boring because the slides were not very helpful. Overall the class was not hard, but I had to pretty much teach myself everything by reading the textbooks. The only reason I went to lecture was to get iclicker points.","Dr. Heath is a very good lecturer. She doesn't read off he slides and knows the content very well. She can be confusing when she lectures on LacZ development. She does give funny and great examples. The content is a bit difficult to understand.

She was definitely my favorite lecturer this semester and sh'e really funny! She's also extremely friendly and is pretty good at elaborating on her ppt slides. This class was fairly challenging for me but by far not the hardest a bio student has to take. The material can be difficult, not Dr. Heath. Lots of i-clickers.","Dr. Heath is one of two IB 204 professors, and they are both good! I probably enjoy Heath's lectures a bit more; she's pretty funny. She also knows her stuff, never reading directly off slides, and being quick to offer examples. Her class is moderate in difficulty, but I struggled more than some others in terms of understanding the material.","Dr. Heath is among the coolest and nicest professors I've had at UIUC. Most of the time she's clear and happily explains any questions. The exams are challenging but not terrible and any work given in the class is truly helpful, not busy-work.

It's the same thing every class (write three sentences). No 95%+ grades","Avoid this professor at all costs. I wish I would have checked this earlier and attempted to switch TA's.

Good luck if you're taking cs 225 next semester","Great professor! Unlike Professor Fleck, Cinda makes the conceptually hard contents easy enough for us. Though there is a great amount of knowledge and workload, it is way more satisfying taking this course than CS173.","She's honestly one of the best lecturers in the CS department. There is a lot of extra credit in CS 225, so passing shouldn't be hard if you didn't struggle in CS 125. Learning the C++ language (even just basics) before taking the class can make things much easier on you, but isn't required.","The class was not really too difficult, but extremely time consuming, you can easily get an A if you put in the time","Best course ever. You can tell she loves what she teaches, and she's good at teaching it. She cares about students very much.

The TAs &amp; piazza will be your main source of help with questions on material/mps/labs. Though the MPs and material may be difficult, it is worth it. Plus, there's extra credit.

She made me fall in love with data structures and her class helped me land my first internship!,"She is enthusiastic but she is not a good communicator. In fact, you have better chance getting help from TAs. TAs are awesome. She barely replies to the emails. Don't get me wrong, she teaches well. My point is she doesn't help students who need help.

She also takes a lot of questions which makes the class a little boring.","Granted, Professor Heeren is very enthusiastic about teaching and this course, however I did not enjoy my experience in this class at all.  Professor Heeren attempts (unsuccessfully so) to keep lectures interesting through jokes tangents that actually distract.  She also refuses to release answers to the previous exams making studying impossible.","Always so enthusiastic and willing to help students.

Ian was helpful and friendly. I highly recommend the class, its an easy and interesting gen ed!",This course teaches you a lot about philosophy. Beware that it is a history of philosophy course so you focus on how philosophy evolved.

927951,4.3,Steve,Helle,24,0.6128463165823494,"As Helle's graduate assistant, I was asked to transcribe all his class lectures from a recording. I was irked at the start, but really learned a lot typing and compiling them for future use. It was a very productive project for me and I learned almost as much as if I'd taken the class, which sounded like terrific fun.","Love this man. Pretty sure the only class he teaches now is in CHP. If you're in CHP and reading this, take the class! It was my favorite class ever, and might have somehow convinced me to go to law school.","The readings could be complex, but he was great at making lectures interesting so I felt that when I left, I had a good grasp on the concept. Grades came from participation and oral debates.","Steve is a great professor. He is very knowledgable on all the subjects we talked about, and they were very interesting. We just had 2 in class debates, an original speech at the end, participation, and a scavenger hunt as part of our grade. He's a very fair grader and it'll be an easy A if you put in the work.","I wasn't looking forward to this class because I had no interest in law, but Helle is so enthusiastic about it that he made the subject fun. Fantastic lecturer, I wish more professors were like him. Exams are challenging, but if you come to almost every class, pay attention and take good notes to study from, it will be okay.",Prof. Helle is a fantastic professor who is passionate and knowledgeable about subject matter. He is everything a college professor should be. Please ignore the imbecile below with a negative post about Prof. Helle.,"A really interesting class that really made me think. Professor Helle was excellent, and with a little bit of effort and decent research, this class is nothing to fear because Helle will help you out if you need it.",Keeps students interested and is really good at explaining the material.,"Helle is a great lecturer, pretty engaging. Topics discussed were pretty interesting. He will call on people at random, so readings aren't optional. Tough but fair grader, he met with people who didn't agree with their grades and allowed them to discuss them. With decent research and speaking abilities, you'll be fine.",has no sympathy. I would not take this class because he made it stressful and puts pressure on you. strongly disliked everything about this class. very negative experience.,"Great Professor. Very hard class, but he is very clear and engaging. He makes it a point to remember your name and will use that to call on you. Very fair grader, but tests are extremely difficult.",Helle's class was pretty hard...there were only 2 exams (1 more is optional) and a small amount of participation. He randomly calls on the students so everyone is engaged. He is a great lecturer and is enthusiastic but the material is challenging. When meeting with him he was also a little rude. The exams are also curved big time.,"This was the college class I feared coming in which I would do my best, try my hardest and still fail. I found it impossible to get higher that 40% on our papers even one's that were 200-500 words longer than the minimum and featured citations from 7 sources and 5 court cases. I really hope the required 411 is much harder otherwise I'm screwed.","Enthusiastic speaker who does a good job keeping the class engaged. He'll randomly call on students to participate so be alert unless you wanna look foolish :D. As others have said, his tests are hard but fair. He expects a lot from students but is willing to answer questions. Definitely not a class you can slack off in.","Greatest professor within journalism.  He's a hard, fair grader.  Study for exams, know your stuff, and he'll reward you.  Don't take his class for a grade; take it to learn.  You'll look forward to going to class.  He's not only a teacher but a performer.",Great teacher. Hard but fair grader as others have said. Always willing to help. No study guides and very hard tests. The first two test are written and the final is a cumulative multiple choice. Make sure you asks questions because he will always explain what he means or clarify what a law means. Very interesting class if you are considering law.,"The class is difficult-there are only 3 exams, an essay, and a hint of participation points. That being said- he is a great teacher. I learned an incredible amount from him, and he takes a great interest in his students. If you have test trouble- talk to him- I needed to. He will help you.","Helle is an interesting character. He's very energetic and bouncy and the subject material in the class is interesting enough. The entire grade is based on you exam grades, so you gotta know your stuff. Also, he picks random people in class to answer questions, so if you don't like participating, you're just going to have to deal with it. Have fun.","Professor Helle is a brilliant man who clearly knows his material well and easily brings his understanding to his students.  Great sense of humor, grades TOUGH but fairly, and was fun to listen to.  Def. Recommend him.","Helle's class is definitely not easy, but it's manageable. Your final grade is based entirely on how you score on 3 exams, so prepare to study your ass off and he can be nit-picky with his grading. You get a scenario, and you have to analyze the legality of it.. strictly essay exams. Helle has a great sense of humor which makes class more bearable."

2097330,4.0,Jeremiah,Heller,7,0.4588903168715614,Lecture is very clear and he gives pretty generous curve &amp; grading.,Really does a great job. Not hard at all. In fact very easy compared to most upper division math classes at UIUC.,This class is easier than I thought. The materials are really not hard at all and the exams are not hard. Proofs in this lecture are very clear. The final is easier than midterms. Professor is very nice.,"Great professor! He rites all his proofs on the board and explains them well. If any concepts are unclear, he's more than available to speak outside of class. Tests are very reasonable; he tells you exactly what you'll be tested on and it's all lecture material if you copy what he puts on the board. Would definitely take another class with him.","New professor to teach MATH347. He prove a lot of things in class only by writing them on blackboard, and most of the time I cannot understand things. Reading book helps a lot. Exams are not doable. In general, never choose a prof whose name contains hell. Very tough. And just little curve.",He is the new professor for 347 and his lecture is terrible. He proves a lot of stuff in his class and the proving process is unclear. He does not clarify the main point of each lesson. His final is a disaster. The whole class is a mess.,"New professor at U of I, class as a whole is moderatly difficult. It is recommended to read the book aswell as it does help. Chegg saved my life in this class as nearly no feedback is given, and online answers are great for studying.  Lectures were kind of boring, but he taught what was needed."
2134505,2.9,Martin,Hellwig,19,0.33302639240660775,Probably one of the more difficult classes I've taken.  Class isn't mandatory but it would help a little to go. Definitely get help from the TAs because they can clear things up for you.,"There is no textbook for this class. His slides are always online, but they are only helpful if you were in class. If you miss class, you have to go to office hours to catch up. There is a lot of live coding. It's very different from my other classes, but once you get the hang of it, it's actually fun. Dr. Hellwig and the TAs are really helpful","Honestly he isn't that great of a professor, but the content is easy enough that you can get an A without really going to his lectures. Just learn the stuff and you will pass. I only needed a 42 on the final to get an A in the class, so just try and ace everything excluding the tests because its easy to do that.","The subject material isn't THAT difficult, he is just terrible at teaching it. All the lecture slides are posted online, but he spends the majority of class live coding and there is no where to refer back to what he does it class. He does so fast and it is extremely difficult to keep up. I found the labs and the TAs to be extremely helpful though.",So I just took my Excel exam yesterday. Was very scared and stoped by Dr. Hellwig's office before. He spent an entire hour helping me. That was so helpful!,"Really cool guy. Hard class for sure (like five hours of homework hard), but he's really helpful.","The machine problems are really hard, but Prof. Hellwig is super nice. There's extra credit on the final project. Don't miss a class though. Things move fast.",This professor sometimes speaks too fast and thus it will be a little hard to get his points. But he is pretty creative and TA truly helps.,No extra credit. Super hard machine problems. What he taught in class was neither the content of the machine problems nor the content of the exams,So I was pretty confused in this class at first. He throws a lot of new stuff at you in a really short time. But before the midterm he sent out some really helpful emails and he also allowed a cheatsheet.,This has got to be the first professor I ever met who will sit down with you and explain the same thing fifty times until you finally get it without making you feel stupid.,"Professor Hellwig is not a good teacher, like he is legit awful.  During lecture he does live coding without explaining anything, leaving you lost and confused.  Avoid this course if you can.",I'm an Economics major and this class is pretty difficult for me. I spend several hours in lab every week. Class moves pretty fast and missing just one hurts pretty bad. But the assistants are really helpful. And Dr. Hellwig is really nice too. Best thing is the live question thing where we can send questions to the big screen.,"His class is super hard, but he does a good job of explaining things. I wish the room was smaller - seeing the screen is pretty difficult from all the way back. Office hours are very helpful, but there are not enough TAs for 700 students! Best time to see him is after class - he always stays an hour late.","He does not teach at all. He does the code on the projector screen, but he doesn't describe what he is doing. You basically have to teach yourself the entire code by asking a million questions in your lab and going to many office hour sessions with the TA's","He is not a good teacher at all. We have four mid-terms each semester and he tested us a lot of things he never talked about. In class, I don't quite understand his logics. Anyway, I won't take his class any more.","I had this class with Wade and Martin. Compare to Wade, Martin didn't see to be really good at teaching. He tried his best to make things funny and attractive but they are just not. Make sure you sit really close to the stage or you will literally see nothing he is doing. The formulas are pretty self-explanatory.","An intro class at the 100 level should not be this hard, but somehow this professor makes it so. The class is disorganized, with MPs released a week after they are assigned and various class slides not being released at all. I'm pretty disappointed in how the class went this semester, as I was really looking forward to the subject material.","I don't like his class. He is not good at teaching at all, and the lectures are boring and confusing. CS 105 is the most overwhelming class I've taken in college. I feel like I learned nothing. And I will never take this class again."
1394427,4.9,Sandra,Henderson,4,0.5993894879270106,Wonderful person. Great teacher. Good class. Highly highly recommend her for all students.,"Best TA ever. So nice. If you show up to class and participate, she'll love you. Super helpful. Only wants you to do well.",Sandra Henderson was my ta for hist 172. She is ALWAYS willing to help which was nice. She knows history fairly well and is a big help before the exams. You have to earn your grade in her discussion class- she doesn't just give it to you. Wasn't a bad discussion class at all- pretty interesting at times. Nice ta,"BEST TA EVER!!!! She did everything possible to help you succeed and was VERY VERY HELPFUL. Plus shes really hot, 10/10 definitely. If you dont get this TA youre missing out"

1495996,3.3,Jarrod,Henderson,7,0.557106309721086,Best teacher ever!!! Everyone will love him!!!,good professor- class is hard,Attendance is not really mandatory. He does randomly call on students to answer questions.,Teaches directly from the book. Attendance is optional if you read. It was his first time teaching the class so I'm sure his ability will improve. Overall a very nice guy.,"It is clear that Dr. Henderson is new to teaching ChBE 221.  His examples in class consist of simply working out the book example problems line for line as done in the textbook.  Often times, he struggles to answer questions that deviate from what can be found in the textbook's working of the examples.  Surely with more experience he will improve","Very calm and happy professor. Class is somewhat difficult but helped by willingness to help with any issues. Emails can be terse, but don't take it as him being upset, he just writes that way. Attendance is pseudo-mandatory, in that he checks occasionally and is factored into an overall ""participation"" factor of the grade.","hard as heck , but fair"
1088345,2.0,Christopher,Hendricksen,7,0.3363674604929069,"How I got a B+ in the class is a surprise to me. Why? He graded 1 essay out of the 7 or so he made us right, but it turns out the 1st essay wasn't even for a grade. We never got our final grades and I'm assuming he arbitrarily assigned grades to everyone. Extremely boring, put me to sleep everytime I attended class.","He explains the readings well in class (you can skip several readings if you just show up and listen to what he says about them). BUT he never graded ANY assignments until the semester was over, so your grade is a total surprise. Very frustrating, I couldn't believe the laziness. I still pulled off an A- but this class was not worth my time.","We have written 5 papers for this class which make up the majority of the grade. School is over now, and he has yet to grade any of them. He'll probably give us all A's, but it's pretty ridiculous. The class is extremely boring, as well.",No Comments.,"I had a very hard time paying attention in this class. He would often change his mind on what he was teaching based on what students would say. Very confusing. Seems like a nice guy though, just isn't very clear.",No Comments,"Boring, but an easy A if you attend class and do some of the readings."
1077029,4.6,Ryan,Hendrickson,16,0.6459321880825268,"The most organized professor I've had in the Political Science Department, while getting an A does take work, it's definitely not difficult. My favorite professor because of his amazing powerpoints (perfectly organized). Lectures are interesting, a few quizzes, two essays, midterm and final.",One of the best professors I've ever had. You will love this class and professor! Cannot recommend him enough!,"He is definitely into what he teaches and makes lecture super interesting. I loved going to class. Take good notes, pay attention, and keep up with the readings because he gives pop quizzes (which you can usually predict). The readings correlate well with lecture so it's easy to follow along. Take him!",Great professor. You can tell he really enjoys teaching and really knows his material so it makes the class much more interesting. The TA I had was great too so overall great class to take whether or not you're interested in PS. Not too bad to look at either.,What a beautiful man. Compelling subject matter. Favorite class this semester.,"Great professor. Interesting and cute. Wish I could take more of his classes. You  have to read because he gives pop quizzes. But the readings are from novels are really interesting. Take notes of reading and you will ace the papers and exams. Take really good notes in class as well, which is easy because he is interesting. Overall great class","There is a decent amount of reading you have to do because he does a few random reading quizzes throughout semester (which dates I find you can predict based off his schedule). All of the written assignments he grades pretty easy, as does he grade pretty easy with the quizzes and exams. The exams are just sometimes slightly too specific but doable.","There is a decent amount of reading that you can't blow off because he leaves open the possibility of a quiz every week. He is passionate about his field and pretty knowledgeable, so if you share his sentiments you will really enjoy the class. Otherwise, it isn't by any means an easy grade if you are looking for a blow off class.","I've had him for 3 classes and have enjoyed all of them.  He is very straightforward and very unbiased.  He doesn't ask a lot of you (do the readings, go to lecture and pay attention), so if you just do those things thoroughly you will do very well.","This prof is great! I have taken PS 280, PS 395, and now PS 390 with him.  He is definitely a great and interesting lecturer.  His tests aren't too bad and as long as you keep up with the reading, you will do fine on the pop quizzes.  There are also some written assignments that are not too bad.  I definitely recommend this prof!","I've had him for 280, 395 and now 390 he structures every class the same, 5 pop quizzes that are extremely easy if you did the readings and two exams that are fairly easy. He's a good teacher and his classes are pretty easy. I'd recommend him.",I have now had Hendrickson for two classes and he is interesting and knowledgable.,Clear cut class. Interested and interesting teacher. Made me love political science!!,"He is a good professor, really interesting and knowledgeable. Only bad part is he doesn't post power points online and his lectures are not pivotal for the exam, however he does random attendance checks and pop quizzes in discussion.",Very good Professor. Lectured very clearly and concisely; 50 min lecture didn't seem like it took that time. Doesn't teach his bias and is very fair; I'd take any of his classes.,"Hendrickson's teaching definitely made this class for me. Very knowledgeable, passionate, and interesting in lecture. Adds a personal touch that made me love international relations even more. On top of that he's very charming and a total babe. discussion is a pain because of pop quizzes, but overall a straightforward and very interesting class."
1237386,1.7,Marie,Henehan,11,0.289109173478338,"Lectures are incoherent. In a matter of 5 minutes, the topic of lecture fluctuates wildly between unrelated topics often not pertaining whatsoever to the assigned readings.  You will receive emails late the NIGHT BEFORE CLASS with information you are expected to know for the next morning.   Please- for your sake- do NOT take this class.",Henehan is extremely intelligent and knowledgeable but makes it very difficult to succeed in her class. Other raters were correct that she rambles and often goes over the hour and a half lecture time she is allotted. It's also correct that it is very history oriented and the only students that succeed at all came in with vast background knowledge.,She rambles. It's confusing. And she expects you to have detailed background knowledge on all US War involvements. This was less of a political science course than it was a history course. She's brilliant but NOT a good professor.,"Henehan is a nice lady but just rambles constantly. It is difficult to get a straight answer out of her for any question. She is not much of a listener just prefers to talk and talk. PS 491 is the internship class, my internship was awesome but the class is way too much work. Stupid assignments and a 20 page paper.",NEVER EVER EVER take a class with her. She started giving random quizzes and only informs us after 10 the night before and will forget to attach the readings to the emails. It feels like she intentionally makes the class a nightmare. She told us we wouldn't have a final and then changed her mind a little over a week before scheduling the final.,"I don't know where everyone else is coming from, I found Prof. Henehan to be interesting, knowledgeable, helpful, and very friendly.  She wants her students to learn, and will go off on a tangent if there is a good discussion to be had.  Tangents always relate to the planned lecture in some way, so deviations from the syllabus aren't a big issue.",DO NOT TAKE HER FOR ANYTHING!  She is a horrible professor.  Her lectures consists of ramblings.  I met with her outside of class and learned nothing!  Worst professor I have ever had.  She needs to retire!,"Don't bother at all. Horrible teacher, if that's what you can even call it. If you care to learn about this topic, just read a book by Louis Fisher about Congress and Foreign policy because that's all you learn",Don't put yourself through taking this class. There is absolutely no structure to lectures. It will take an hour of rambling just to get to the information you need to know and then she doesn't even cover it all so you get behind. Grading takes forever. All the learning you do is done by reading she doesn't teach any information. Worst professor ev,She was just ridiculous.  I always went to class and learned nothing.  She rambled about nothing and I always went to her about the papers and tests and showed her i was very concerned about the information and my grade and she still always gave me the same grade on everything a C.  Dont take her and if you get here drop out.,"Not an extremely difficult grader but I learned very little in this class; the consensus of our study groups was that few to nobody actually understood the lectures - tough to split up testable material and ramblings. In addition, expect a greater than average amount of reading. Overall I don't recommend taking this class."
1864543,1.5,Julie,Hengst,2,0.21503212836374025,"I wish I learned more in this class because I was interested in the material, but she was not a helpful instructor. The class itself was not difficult but I do not feel I learned as much as I could have.",She is not clear at all. When she explains the material it will confuse you more. Her material is not important for learning. If you were to read the book and never go to class you would be better off. But the book will not help you for the exams. Does not upload lecture slides unless told more than twice.

I hated the course, but she actually made it not so bad. Get into her discussion classes!","Sarah is awesome!!!  She is a native German and just moved here this year.  You will learn a ton from her, yet the class is not difficult.  She is fun, flexible, relatable and just all-around a nice person.

The semester is split into 2 by having 2 main essays you work on. Plenty of time to do them with a lot of opportunities for feedback. If you take some time to work in this class you'll get an A,"It is kind of hard to rate her because we never saw her all semester, only the TA.  2 main big essays that you do, but other than that it is a pretty low maintenance class.  HW is online and can be ridiculously subjective sometimes (for example asking what a painting symbolizes or something) but it is doable.  No exams/quizzes so that is nice.","1 lecture and 2 discussions a week. Her lectures are mandatory since there's iclicker points. 2 exams and a final (with a retake on 1 exam if you did poorly). 2 essays with an opportunity to edit mistakes for some points back. Lots of useless online homework and workbook activities. She can be helpful, but test out of this class if you can.","She was a great professor, but her exams were kind of hard. Even while speaking in spanish, she was easy to understand.","Generally, she was a good professor. Lectures were interesting. But she is very strict with grading. Make sure you READ THE SYLLABUS FULLY. She had important information on there about grading of assignments that you could miss if you don't read it.","She's pretty good doing lectures. She makes them interesting and entertaining. However there is a TON of iclicker points every week so make sure you go to lecture. Also, there is a lot of homework online. But overall, the course was very easy to manage.","Nice and enthusiastic, but also difficult and goes far too fast in lectures. There is also an unreasonable amount of online homework.","Provides a horrible rubric for the class. Huge negative is her importance on rough drafts. 30% of the grade is based on 8 drafts worth 2 points a piece. TA rarely gives 22 on drafts so you basically lose 15% of your grade right away. Her response when asked about extra credit was ""afraid not."" Never comes to class, required to buy HER book online.",She's very clear and makes the content easy to understand. The exams are a bit difficult.,She was a decent teacher but without my prior knowledge and amazing TA I don't think I would've done as well. She gives random extra credit assignments and points which is a big plus.,"I had a bad TA which really killed the class considering there were two discussions a week, but the one lecture we would have was excellent. She infuses humor and intellect brilliantly. A terrific professor.","I was told that I took the class AFTER they revamped it, so it may have been a lot harder since they were testing it out on the new group of kids. She was okay, tried to make things clear, but the exams were SO difficult, and no partial credit. Did my best, but did not enjoy it too much.",She's a sweetheart and very clear with her explanations. Definitely a great teacher.,"Never interacted, just the TAs haha. But from what I've seen, she's not to sore on the eyes! The classes/lecture was run by the TAs and all the hw was online I loved the TAs, but the class was ridiculous. The homework wasn't very related to the class and the tests and written exams were incredibly difficult. Pity I have one semester left.",Florencia is one of the nicest teachers you will ever have.  She makes the class interesting and engaging.  Even if you are not very good at spanish she will help you learn.  Very fair grader.,"I had her for Spanish 103 and I love her!

Self-teaching matters A LOT in this class, and be careful that this class gets harder before you realize it.",He defines me. Never mind.,"He definitely cares about the students, but sometimes the lectures can be boring",He really cares about students. Responds to emails quickly. Very clear lectures.

Enthusiastic, happy and knows his material well. Will gladly take another class with the dude",GG always re. Herman best professor NA.,"He is super enthusiastic, and will go over everything very clearly. If you have questions however, it is best to go to office hours because if you ask during class he just sort of repeats what he just said. At office hours he is fantastic. Just a super nice guy overall! Hard course though...",Students cant understand full circuit design unless their homeworks deal with more fundamental simple design concepts. Grades are important  so challenging problems on graded homeworks with less time to figure them out debilitate confidence if there is no corresponding support provided in teaching. Can improve course structure greatly.,Great prof. Too bad he is not here all the time.,"Professor Herman's version of ECE290 is exciting and educational, giving us the chance to get into team based learning at the sophomore level. He's a very enthusiastic lecturer as well, definitely would recommend taking 290 with him if you can."

Prepares helpful quiz study guides, exam study guides, his own practice exams, and uses relevant examples in all of the slides.  There is really nothing he could do to be a better teacher - he's just that excellent. Best class I've taken.","He makes things simple and clear. Prepared a lot of materials before class, e.g. videos/pictures/articles to make simple things even simpler. He also prepares thorough study guides quiz reviews, and exam reviews, basically everything. Quizzes are easy. The only thing is he speaks too fast and quite soft.","Best teacher I so far.

You can earn %3 extra credit through a paper or subject pools.,This class is so easy and there is even extra credit. Ivan(jorge) is super nice and goes over everything thoroughly. He is a grad student but he knows his stuff. Just 2 tests and 5 question quizzes every week.,"This class was super-easy, just pay attention and you'll definitely do well.

The material can become overwhelming,but you can choose what assignments you do to earn your final grade.","Good guy. Sometimes maybe tries a little too hard to be funny. But at the end of the day, teaches well. Maybe a little too much reading. But if you complete all the quizzes and stick to discussion its an easy A.","Now that he's teaching the class, he's making the class way too hard for everybody. There is a ridiculous amount of readings EVERY DAY for a 100-level class, and you get quizzed on it EVERY WEEK. be careful if you want to take this class.","A nice and caring man.

Her lectures were thorough and inspirational, and the two large writing assignments and one group project were meaningful. There was also consistent communication and feedback for questions and assignments. The class content truly helped to shift my world view.","Dr. Herrera provides a rigorous, while extremely interesting course.  She is insightful and well-respected by students.  I was intimidated to take a course with her as she has such a powerful reputation, but she was incredibly kind and understanding.  She does not give work that isn't meaningful.  I would highly recommend any class taught by her.","Dr. Herrera is a wonderful orator and presents research and perspectives in her class that are both cutting edge and relevant to current discourse, and historical in nature in order to give context from where the current conversation has evolved from. The readings and assignments were all  coherent and never felt out of place. Highly recommended.","Her class is amazing. Honestly there are lots of reading and assignment, but her insightful lecture and expirience are truly helpful and worth taking this class. Even if so much work to do, it lasts for a long time.","I am very glad that I took this class! Dr. Herrera is a wonderful teacher, great lecturer, and extremely fair with course policies and grades. I admired her unbiased style of teaching through controversial topics, and how flexible she was to students' needs. It was always a pleasure to speak with her, and I would recommend this class to anyone!","I loved her course on the Politics of Education. There are a lot of readings for one class but most of them are interesting and reasonable! I would recommend anyone who has a slight interest in education to take this class! As long as you read, attend class and participate, you shouldn't have a hard time with this course!",The readings and class discussions gave me a good introduction to the traditions of knowledge and education in the Middle East. Prof Herrera's discussions of methodology (biography and critical ethnography) and development in education exposed me to new information and ideas that I continue to draw on. This was a very worthwhile course.,"This was a fantastic class - challenging and engaging.  Prof. Herrera carefully crafted the class and readings so each week built on the last and by the time I wrote my final research paper, I realized I had a solid and diverse grounding in the subject matter. She was very supportive and helpful.  I would definitely take another one of her classes","This class was my favorite in GSE. Dr Herrera related the foundational frameworks in youth studies and education with current events and contemporary debates, making every bit of info. we learned relevant and applicable.

Every class was watching a clip of TV shows and writing a portion that ends up in the final paper.",She is very very particular about what she wants.,Laura is a great profess.

Also does group quizzes.","Really nice guy, but makes his class so unreasonably hard. He rambles on things with no context.I catch myself falling asleep and his explanations aren't actually helpful. He doesn't provide much for the student to study from except their own notes. If you don't have any experience in other media classes or not a wiz in media, don't take his class.","One of the easiest classes / gen ed I've taken at UIUC. But, the professor speaks in such a monotone voice that it PUTS YOU TO SLEEP!!! The ONLY reason I attend lecture is for iClicker points. The exams are all multiple choice, just skim the readings. The discussion is not worth going to at all. I barely studied. Forgettable class. Easy A+.","First semester teaching the subject. Slides are disorganized and expressed in a very monotone voice.

This style makes him hard to track in lecture, but he is more than willing to explain himself in more normal terms if you ask.  His grading is easy, but the material can be a bit dense",This professor could care less about teaching. It was an easy class but it could have been so much better if he wasn't so stuck on research.

Be warned: LOTS of reading to do, and it's hard to skimp out on the reading.","Very good lecturer, but since it was the Intro to Hist. Interpretation course, she wasn't allowed to lecture much. Tends to split people up into discussion groups with questions regarding the day's readings, which can get annoying. She was really helpful and loves what she teaches, and that comes though in the class.",Very intersting class if you are interested in that time period in which the class it taught.

Good office hours and lecture notes, but rough oral presentation. Textbook was useless. He's not bad for a first-time teacher, but let's hope he gets better.","First of all, it's difficult to teach this course to a large class.

He has not mastered preparedness yet and can come off as a bit of a jerk, but is more enthusiastic than any other professor I've had. He is making the class more difficult than it has been in the past, but to be honest the workload is still minimal compared to other classes. Cry more.",Great instructor. He makes the material more bearable since 370 is supposed to be awful to begin with. I don't know why people don't like him. All the negative comments are because some people are clearly frustrated by the ME program here and don't understand the point of a design class that is very open ended unlike ME 170.,Not a professor that anyone should have inflicted on them. He only wants to show off and not teach us anything.,"This is the most unprofessional instructor I have had in my 5 semesters. He is routinely unprepared for class, rarely gives examples, and favors his friends in the class.  His condescending attitude is present both in class and in office hours.

Even though the content wasn't super interesting necessarily, he taught the material really well and made the class a lot of fun","Super nice and interesting.  As long as you show up, participate, and come in some what prepared for the tests; you should get an A no problem.  The only reason I didn't is because I missed like 5 days of class.

Some or maybe most of the college professors will be biased; like having poor course organizations and inconsistencies in grading.",Very well prepared for lectures.,"Professor Hieronymi's lectures are clear and straightforward. He posts all lecture notes online and also posts practice problems. He is very approachable and always willing to help. I recommend going to his office hours if you have any questions. Overall, one of my absolute favorite professors.","To be honest I only went to lecture twice, but some people might have benefited from going. He went through a pre-printed lecture note packet, and uploaded it later to compass.   Discussion quizzes were EASY (show up without any knowledge, TA teaches you the material, get a 1010. Exams were EASY. Final was  hard, I went from a 93% to a B+ :(","Good teacher, plus, he provided tons of content from other places. So if you weren't understanding something, you just had to try another source that he provided. The easiness of the first two exams made me ill prepared for the third one though. My fault really, but a heads up would have been nice.","Fantastic professor. Kept lectures as practical and simple as possible. Always posted a practice exam almost identical to the actual exam. Best of all, he made the textbook optional.","For how abstract the course material was, he did a great job presenting the content in a clear way. He was lenient on hw deadlines, and exams were very fair. Also posted lecture notes online.","His lectures were absolutely clear compared to the other 225 professors. On top of that, his fill in notes were a godsend.  Finally, he makes sure that you all succeed.  I've never had a math class where the average from the first midterm be an 86%.

Homeworks and exams are challenging and are designed to make sure you understand material and aren't just regurgitating notes.  Very fair grader and takes effort into account.  Happy to help and make time for anyone.","His grading scheme is ridiculous.  He only gives A's to the top 25%.  So even if you study really hard and understand the material inside and out, you still might not get an A.  He tries to trick you on the tests too.  Plus when he lectures, he'll start one analogy, then segway into another analogy.

First of all you have to attend every class or you lose credit. Second he will call on people to answer questions even if they aren't ready, if you're like me and have anxiety about such things it makes class awful.","Higgins is incredible. His lectures ask really tough questions that any good teacher should be actively thinking about. He really values participation and will encourage you to think more deeply while being respectful of your comfort zone/personal opinions. Lots of reading, but it's all worthwhile.

There is a lot of reading but not really any other homework and no tests. He just wants you to come and listen and open your mind. Even if you are confused by philosophy, Higgins is one of the most inspirational, intelligent professors I have ever had and I would highly recommend him","Fantastic lectures on edu philosophy.

Very articulate and leads interesting discussions.",Overall he's a really nice guy who is passionate about education but honestly he speaks so abstractly that he becomes impossible to follow. Definitely believes in the Socratic method of teaching...,He is a nice and smart guy but this course does not nealy meet quality learning. I do not recommend to take this course. It's waste of time.,"While he could be helpful if you asked, the most unpleasant  part of the class was his content.

He has a lot of office hours and ""open houses.""",One of the best teachers in U of I.,I'm told that he is the best professor in uiuc who teach math 241,Good teacher but sometimes may be too professional. The lectures and homework doesn't prepare you for exams as many problems aren't like anything you've seen in class. Reading the textbook and doing old tests help more. Homework is optional but continuos effort is necessary to get A. He curves every quiz and exam. Personaly I jst dont like him much,"I do recommend this professor. He curves everything including each quiz. If you take Cal III and want a good grade, he's ur best choice.","Good teacher who knows his stuff. For me it seemed as if the lectures and homework didn't quite prepare me for exams as many problems aren't like anything you've seen in class or in the book, but a nice guy who is very willing to help.",A solid professor. There's really nothing to complain about here. I'd take more classes with him if I could.,"this is a difficult class, but required for A.S. major, and u need to learn the materials for the A.S. exam, and the A.S. exam is much harder than his exam, so compare to the ""real exam"", this class isn't that bad.

She makes you participate, but it's beneficial!","Laura was fantastic! I was excited about this class from first meeting her for my placement exam over the summer, and the class was even better than I expected. She's from Bologna, and she really knows what she's talking about. She's very kind and understanding. There's online hw a few times a week and a blog post every week.","I took her class out of interest in Italian when I was an undergrad and therefore I got the chance the know Laura for over 3 years.

Mandatory attendane only because he uses skeleton notes...find a buddy in the class and you're golden!,I thought the class was incredibly stupid. His exams always include the most random things and are very awkwardly worded.,"The class was very easy.  Attendance is mandatory. There are skeleton notes, you just have to go to class to complete them.  The test questions come DIRECTLY off of the notes, meaning it's the only thing you really have to study.  The discussion/lab section usually only lasts an hour even though the time allotted is 2 hours.  GOOD CLASS",Class is not that hard if you study.  Grades come from 3 tests and lab assignments.  Dr. Hillman is a nice guy and a good teacher.,No Comments,Grade comes from 3 exams (2 - 1 hour exams and an hour and a half final exam) worth 25% of the grade each and a discussion section with 5 assigments worth a total of 25%.  Attendance is not required but I highly recommend it. This class is basicly the first in a series of sport psych classes.

If you are an individual who is grounded in logic and reality, there is a slim chance that you will actually get anything out of this class. His 80 min classes are 60 min of fussing about, 20 minutes of confusing, stream-of-conscious lecture. Great man, Bad teacher.","Professor Hillmer is somewhere between ""goofy"" and ""eccentric"". Show up to class, write the dozens of papers, and you'll probably get an A.","I will never forget this class.  In all honesty, I think it was the best class I took at UIUC.  Every person I recommended to take this class came back thanking me time and time again.  Some topics were rough at times (ppl have diff interests), but at the end, I was glad I stuck it through.  Take it, and you'll never regret it, guaranteed",The journey with professor Hillmer was amazing. He's an incredibly nice guy and cares about every each one of the students.,"Prof. Hillmer was incredibly helpful in teaching the class, and I came away with a much better understanding of ethics and philosophy. I only had one issue with the class: I didn't care for his use of the causality proof for the existence of a god, as this argument is flawed. Unfortunately, theology took front stage in some discussions on ethics.",Professor Hillmer's journey is a must take! Best class I'll ever take at UIUC!,Best teacher I've had. He is very helpful and he listens and talks well of every student that is in his class.,Amazing course and professor. So fair and understanding to students. Got an A fairly easily,"Excellent professor, very understanding.  Highly recommended.",Professor Hillmer is easily the best professor I have ever had. He teaches the ECE ethics course and does a remarkably good job at it. He is very enthusiastic and care greatly for his students.

Because there is no disc. sect for PS 318, many of the questions on reading happen in lecture, and can get awkwardly silent when no one can answer them. Tests essay based, but he gives you the selections ahead of time to prepare. Genuinely caring, promotes a good understanding of topics, but weird lecture structure","He's an animated professor, but comes off as condescending imo. He seems to really care and encourages students to visit him during office hours. Tons of readings (100+ pages per week), lectures are disorganized (no powerpoints; he goes on tangents), grading is fair (2 midterms + final w/ cheat sheets, paper, attendance). Material is really dry",Requires lots of reading: different articles/books every week. Wrote about 4 short essays and one term paper. No quizzes and only one test (final). He is a nice guy who is open to suggestions and helping you if you ask. Overall he is not a tough grader and this class is not hard to pass if you do put in some work.,"Very practical- if you need an extension because you were lazy, he will grant that. If you need extra help, he is willing to help. However, his grader (at least for PS 321 Fall '16) was not as lenient. Hinchliffe's personality as a professor puts you at ease and then you receive your first homework  grade. Don't play yourself- put in enough work!","I'd like to keep it short.. As much as i like his personality and kindness, he is the worst instructor i've ever had in my entire life.","Such a boring teacher. Asks questions that have no answer and if they do, you have to be a mind reader. Soooo much homework for a 1-credit class. Wouldnt recommend this class to my worst enemy. He is an eccentric teacher but will talk on and on about vague and abstract ideas which dont help you at all for the papers he assigns.","PS 220 wasn't an entertaining or fun class. He droned on and on and just laughed at his own jokes. However, he's also an adviser who tries to get everyone to not go into law. I don't listen to him when he tells me to give up on law school, but I wish he would help students rather than making them feel dumb and incapable of succeeding.",Lectures were incredibly boring and you have to work to get a good grade in this class. He uses powerpoints for every lecture and it was difficult to stay interested.,"Hinchliffe said that he has not taught this class in awhile so I'm assuming it can only get better. The class lectures can be long, the readings are pretty interesting. Overall, you should do fine as long as you're somewhat interested in Public Policy.",I took his 101 class my freshman year and had him as an advisor. He told me to change my career path my first semester of freshman year. I did not listen to him and I changed advisors. I now have an internship at a law firm where the partners have agreed to hire me in three years once I pass the BAR. Point is DO NOT LET THIS MAN KILL YOUR DREAMS.,"The class content itself is very interesting which is why I chose to take the class. If you're looking for a blow-off class, this is not for you. Long 120 minute lectures plus reading assignments that can be up to 120 pages + is not my idea of a blow-off. It isn't impossible to pass though as long as you go to class and do the readings.","So I'm a freshman who took his PS 101 class. READ EVERYTHING HE GIVES AND SHOW UP TO LECTURE. That is what I learned this past semester. This class is serious, but incredibly interesting. I say read because his slides give  brief overview over what you had to read. Political Science is no joke and I think that's what he's trying to show.","Worst instructor ever! He is rude, selfish and arrogant!","I don't know why everyone here hates Hinchliffe so much. I think he's a super nice and helpful guy. I enjoyed 321, and I think he's a great advisor.","Not at all surprised by the other comments- this guys likes to smile while actually being rude to students.  Not a pleasant experience working with him, not just for his attitude but also his ability to effectively do his job as counselor to the students who pay his wage.","How did this man become the director of undergrad polisci studies? Inconsiderate, patronizing, so pretentious, and a lazy advisor. The other two advisors are way more interested and personable. They should stage a coup.","Ok for all the PS101 posters and rookie PS majors: PS is a major that has LOTS of reading as a Junior I have 600 pages a week typically. (I don't read all of it) So the level of reading in PS101 is typical. PS-322 was an amazing class, not hard, although I know of some people who struggled CAUSE THEY DONT READ ESSAY PROMPTS lol. Hinchlife is awsome","Just do the work and study and you'll get an A. Everyone is exaggerating. However, you do have to put a little more effort than you would expect to get an A.","Professor Hinchliffe is a great professor with high exoextations! Although this class is difficult, I've gained allot from the experience. This class is here to get rid of all the Poli Sci major students who don't really have a passion for Political Science. Just do the readings+practice time management. I'm continuing my with my major!","I was very interested in politics before this arrogant man ruined it. Want to ruin your gpa? Take his class.

Many people are intimidated by him just because he is about 6'-6"" and has a loud voice, but he is a good instructor. At times, some of his instructions can be unclear and confusing, however, he is more than willing to meet with students to discuss problems!","I respect the man because he treats students like adults and not children.I think alot of people are intimidated by him because he is a big man with large voice.His core teaching style does not revolve around intellectualism, but on competency.He is a seasoned architect and not an academic stuck in a fantasy world of intellectual masquerading, Amen","Very disorganized, no syllabus so the entire semester was a guessing game about when projects were due.

HHH is wonderful.","Prof Hock is very punny and includes a lot of humorous illustrations to help you remember material. Attendance was mandatory, but it used the same material in the book. The assignments were busy work. The grading never made sense because they claimed to be holding us to a higher standard and then curving. Easy, fun class, just can be frustrating.","def knows his stuff. very likable guy who came to class w/ a big ol smile. it was very boring! didn't seem very applicable to life tho he seemed to think it was haha. my TA sucked and didn't do anything. if we asked her if something was right, she would say ""you should know that!"" wtf? then she expected top work out of us lol. ok for blowoff.","Triple H is hilarious! I don't really like Linguistics, but he made the class more interesting with his jokes and comics. He loves his students and will help them succeed. Easy A. Know vocab outlined for each section and you'll ace the pop quizzes. Really easy and laid back class.","Hock is well prepared for lectures and I enjoyed his class very much. I like the way the course is structured because I find myself focus more on learning rather than worrying about my grades all the time. If you love language and its history, think no more and sign up for Hock's class. Strongly recommended.","He's a nice guy but the class is useless...I learned nothing, not one thing.",Not sure about hot but he is a good looking man for his age.  The class is very interesting and he tries really hard to make it so.  I love the class so much I'm changing majors.,"i really enjoyed the class, and the workload wasn't bad at all. i thought the content was really interesting, but you have to study for his tests and go to lecture (or read during lecture, as i did)... very easy to do well in the calss, and Hock is funny. he wrote the textbook and is very thorough","very easy class and interesting too, triple H looks like he's going fishing all the time! gotta love all the cartoons too!","Great class. Not hard, so long as you go to lecture. Hock will do what it takes to see his students suceed. Im pretty convinced you have to actually try to get less than a B, not because the class is easy, but because he gives so many chances to improve grades. No final either, only a paper!"

He is always late, unorganized, forgetful and can never give a clear answer for anything. Never replies to any emails, doesn't go by the syllabus, and never returns assignments. Lectures are rambles and topics are uninteresting. Don't take this professor for ANYTHING.",Really nice guy. If you ask for help he will help you. But in class he struggles a lot with his computer and projector. Kind of of rambles a lot during lecture. Don't look to learn a whole lot from this class but it is an easy gen ed.,"If you have any class with this man, run! His lectures were ramblings, he never returned any of our work or graded any of it, and he didn't assign our final project until a week before the final.

He got sick late into the semester so got absolutely NO feedback on any of our projects so we still didn't know if we were doing the project according to the way he liked it. Believe me, its either his way or the highway. Also literally spent an entire class talking about shoes.","I had a lot of trouble with this guy. He was sick during the semester and was late to class almost everyday. He canceled class 4 times as well. He liked to get off-topic during the lectures and talked about stupid stuff like what kind of computer he likes, etc. I didn't learn anything at all in this class.",DO NOT take with hodges!,No Comments,"Loves to talk about anything and everything except the material on the slides.  Very interesting teacher though.  Test wasn't too bad, just put some effort into the projects/presentations and you'll be fine.","Never stays on topic but his conversations are at least somewhat interesting.

She is great when it comes to connecting medieval culture to the present day - we talked a lot about ethnicity, race and gender identity.

Overall, I learned more in this course than any other. Hes a bright guy, very excited at what he teaches although it can be a bit boring.","Lecture attendance isn't mandatory, and I wouldn't recommend it, either. Everything on the tests (only two: midterm and final) can be found in the textbook; you MUST read the book to do well in the class. Lectures make you contemplate suicide.

Graded assignments harshly and his TAs were not helpful at all. Discussion topics did not overflow from lecture at all. He did not inform his TAs of what he was thinking, ever. Overall not that easy of a class, BUT he was a better exception that HINCHECLIFFE.",Agree with others.  Tests have ridiculous facts on it--like the population of the colonies at Revolutionary War time--for a political science class.  Expects student to know every single page of the book for the tests.  Lectures are like eating yourself alive.,"He knows his stuff. GOOD LUCK on the tests, he puts random facts and figures on it, and you have to ""know the entire book"" in order to do well. Other than that, he is very helpful.",he seemed like he had to refer back to the book alot,"To make sure you come to lecture, he doesn't post notes online.  Exam questions have statistics from the textbook on them (unfair) and don't just cover the material, but useless factoids--these seem to be a filter so only a few bookworms with really good memories can get A's on the exams.  3 essays, 2 exams... 2 much work for a 100-level class.",Nice guy! I didn't likr him at first cause he was late to class and a bit borring but he got better at being on time.  Bit too much reading but assignments and testwere decent.,"VERY NICE PROFESSOR!! Lecture can be boring but it as long as you take notes, the exams aren't bad at all. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!! He's very understanding and willing to help whenever he can!",No Comments,"This professor is so boring. Sitting through his lectures is torture. Also, he assigns too much reading for the course. Perhaps if he'd add more hands-on projects instead of lecturing every day, his class would be more interesing. But, he probaby won't and his classes will remain utterly boring."

From my experience she is not that strict when it comes to grading essays. Assigns plenty of readings and responsive writings to go with the reading assignments. Fantastic professor if you are interested in the subject matter.","valerie is very knowledgeable and her lectures are clear, interesting and easy to follow. there's a considerable amount of work to do for this class - reading responses due twice a week and 3 major essays. Not a blowoff class, but the material is really interesting if you're willing to put the work in.","She's a very nice lady in person, but oh my gosh is she a difficult professor. I honestly think she's just brilliant and thinks everyone else is too? She expects you to leave that course an expert on Islam and I felt the material was much too dense for an introductory course. I reallyyyyyy recommend against this course unless you're very passionate","Dr. Hoffman is a generally nice person overall but this doesn't transfer over into her teaching. Her tests revolve around memorization of super specific details including dates of random events. Also, don't take your phone out in class because she will not hesitate to take it away like you're in high school (saw it happen twice)","I had her for RLST 213 since I needed an advanced composition course. Her lectures were some of the most informative, best prepared, and interesting I've had at UIUC. Very unbiased, gave a lot of material to read, and kept me interested throughout the course. She's a real scholar, and I would take her again in a heartbeat.",One hard final and 6 papers and attendance affect grade! Good luck amazing class just stick to it you will be fine make sure you attend all classes and read,Very unpleasant woman. Hard to sift between stories and relevant material. Loves to talk about herself. Kind of intimidating for a 60 year old white lady. Very tough to get an A,Absolutely awful. Will tear students who are just trying to participate to shreds.,"Certainly NOT an agreeable woman.  Questions seem to offend her and she will respond like the question was preposterous and you're stupid.  Not compromising.  But honestly, I complained about her throughout the class but I still got an A+.  So not the worst class, completely doable.  E-mailing her politely seems to make her like you more...","Hoffman is an extremely demanding and strict professor. She doesn't seem to realize that students have other classes as well. You can't miss a single class without losing points and she expects a ton of reading as well as eight papers, pop quizzes, and a final. She didn't realize it was a 100 level course. It's a shame, it could've been a fun class",Valerie Hoffman is the most horrific person in the world.,"A really lot of reading and work, but she is extremely knowledgable; I suggest for those actually interested in the subject, not a blowoff by ANY means","Tough class, lot of work, but she is AMAZING!","A very in depth class that involves too much reading and not enough discussion. Does not enjoy teaching. Questions offend her and she likes to make people look like fools in front of the class. Grading is inconsistent, can be good one week and terrible the next. More like an english teacher, cares more about grammar than content. Anal beyond belief",It was a summer class... it was horrible. Introduction to Islam. Muslim students got C's in this class... relatively no women take this course. Professor openly discussed that she became interested in studying Islam because of the opression of women. Is ultra-anal about grammar. ULTRA-anal.,"She is very tough on her students and very thorough in her class material, but it is a great class if you want to actually learn something.  This was the fourth class I've taken with her, and I'd recommend her to any student willing (and wanting!) to work hard and get a lot out of class.  Her lectures are pretty entertaining, too!",Hardest class I've ever taken.  Interesting but a lot of work for being an introduction class but she did also clarify at the beginning of the semester that although it was labeled intro it was still a 200 level course. If you're looking for a blow off non western this is NOT it.,"Very challenging, but I have taken two classes with her now, and I would recommend any of her upper level courses. She tends to be more strict with her intro class for some reason, but in her upper levels she can be downright entertaining. She's also very, very knowledgable and write alot of material for journals. You'll learn alot if you try.","An actual college course in which you'll learn if you try. It is an intense introduction by perhaps one of the university's best professors. It is no blow-off. It involves much work, which is what college is about--learning.

Her class does have a lot of course load, but she does a great job at helping you if you need it. Love her! Would definetely have her again!!","April is a great teacher. Sometimes she would give too many confusing definitions, but lots examples. At times lecture didn't exactly line up with worksheets. She always took questions and made sure we understood things. Great personality and easy to talk to. Always made sure TAs were avaliable for help. Takes forever to answer emails, like 4 days","Dr. Hoffmeister was a good professor. She explains the material quickly but thoroughly and WANTS you to ask questions if you are confused. If you don't pass the tests, it's literally your own fault because she gives you a list of what material you should study and a lot of the test material is taken from homework.","I loved having Dr. Hoffmeister as a professor and always enjoyed going to lecture.  She has high expectations of her students, but also really cares about your success in the course.",She is very fair and caring. But the work is very hard! Go to office hours! I was solid till the final of this class,Math 103 was very hard. Don't think it is easy because of the course description. But Prof. Hoffmeister is great. She is nice and cares about you doing well. She gives lots of outside help in office hours. GO TO OFFICE HOURS IF YOU ARE HAVING A HARD TIME!,"Dr. Hoffmeister is an amazing instructor.  I am not sure where these people come up with the idea that her exams are impossible.  You are attending a well-respected four year University, AND you are preparing to become educators yourselves.  Quit whining, grow up, and start acting like responsible adults and not spoiled little brats.","Professor Hoffmeister is definitely tough, but she is indeed fair. She talks about her children a lot and incorporates what they are learning into our lessons. The class itself s incredibly tough. There are four exams and, so far, 2 of the 3 taken have been impossible. There is so much material, and it is never truly clear what to study.",Professor Hoffmeister was great and very clear of her expectations.  Really inspirational and helpful!

But most importantly, do the readings before class, otherwise you'll be lost. Tests are mostly essay format.","Professor Hoganson is enthusiastic about what she does. Often dull content though, and she moves too fast through the powerpoints where often times you don't have time to take proper notes. Had to read 3 novels on top of the textbook &amp; source readings. Take home midterm was helpful as opposed to in-class. Reasonable class but be prepared to read.",Interesting course if you're interested in Modern US history.,"Her lectures are pretty interesting, uses a lot of videos and examples to break up straight lecture.  If you like American History you'll like this class, there's 2 papers a midterm and a final, papers aren't on the easiest topics but manageable and exams were not too bad at all.  Grade also includes in class quizzes and section participation","Although many students don't like the content taught in her class, I really enjoyed her class and I really felt that she went out of her way to make the class fair for students. She made it extremely clear what would be on the exams and even gave us some slack during the TA strike.","Boring lectures, excessive reading, and an overly difficult final exam (if you don't remember all of the readings, you're screwed).","Teaches a very skewed view of history. This class is American history until 1877, and we didnt touch the revolutionary war, war of 1812 or the civil war at all. She taught about minorities and womens history. A little of that is ok, but this is not a minorities class. A LOT OF READING!! tests were made impossible, and were 3 hrs of essay writing",She was a very nice professor who seemed to enjoy what she was teaching. I enjoyed her lectures greatly. The midterm was not too difficult as long as you kept up with the readings and the lectures.,Awesome!,"Overall, she was very nice and knew what she was talking about. She worked around a TA strike to make sure we didn't miss any of the information necessary for the exam. There was only 1 midterm and a final. Listens to classes;even as far as allowing us to submit questions to use on the final.Did have a lot of readings but nothing to hard.","Yeah, she definitely did not teach history the way I was expecting a college level course to be taught.  Also, she did spend waaaaaay too much time on minorities and women's sufferage rather than other pertinent political issues and interesting figures in history.  We talked about the actual battles of the civil war for no more than 5 min",If you have a bad TA then you are in for a  LONG semester. Prof. talks very quietly in lecture and tends to ramble a little. Very passionate about her subject material but lectures are straight from the readings. All grades are from essays and writing so your grade is basically up to your TA.,We had to read four books. I used to like history...before I took this class. The lectures what she bases the class on but they are EXTREMELY boring.,"she seems really biased against the guys in our class. she encourages people to participate but when we do, she completely downplays our thoughts. i feel like a moron in her class.","Prof Hoganson is a real good teach. The class was interesting and if you go to all the lectures, you will get a good grade in the class. The tests arnt to hard at all and she keeps you interested during lectures. Overall, great teacher, pretty good class.","I would avoid this class if you aren't a history major/accustom to history courses. She teaches rapidly during lecture, and all of the TAs grade difficultly. The average in my section was a C+. I come from Business and I had no idea what the TAs wanted in the papers until it was too late. Interesting material, though. 2 Papers = 35% of the grade","Amazing professor, the best or second best I've had in all 4 years. Don't have to read the book in either HIST 170 or 274, just pay attention in lecture and regurgitate info on test to get a good grade. Both HIST 274 and 170 (adv. comp) are good classes to take. Extremely knowledgable, she knows what she's talking about, and she's very nice.",Midterm and final are memorizing terms. Not a difficult class if you follow instructions. Class is actually interesting for a non-history major. She teaches with a slight liberal/anti-American bias. But who in the history department isn't a socialist? Get Mike Lehman as you TA.,"Prof, Hoganson is a very interesting and helpful professor.  She really makes history alive and relevant.  Personally, I think it's good that there are people out there who know America isn't perfect and while she never seemed biased against America, it's not a bad thing to present America's faults.","Professor Hoganson is an extremely bias professor.  She constantly focuses on projecting the United States of America in a bad light, and very rarely mentions good moves that America has made throughout history."

The class could have used more Chuck Norris though... :),"He's TA to 290 during semester time, but teaches the course over summer, he's great at teaching and HWs are a lot doable than Brown's. for those aren't that bright, this is definitely the one u want to take for 290!","Got the course in the summer.

Exams were easy if you studied using the study guide given. Textbook was rarely used.,If you go to class this course is a pretty easy A. I saved this class for my final semester and it was perfect.  Just sat up front and pretended to care.  Prof. Holmes was a really nice guy and did seem to care about the topic and his students if that matters to you.  So Long UIUC!,"Class was very interesting, but the weekly homework was a bit boring and required attendance.  Biggest bonus was there was no text book and everything you needed was on Compass.  The reviews were really helpful too.  I would recommend taking any class taught by Mr. Holmes",Very easy class! He'll tell you everything you'll need to know for the exam....so go to class....the assignments are extremely easy so make sure you do all of them! I got all B-'s on every single exam and since I did all of the homework I still got an A in the class. The same grade as those who studied hard enough to get As on all of their exams :),This was so boring I dropped. Easy A.,"he's a good teacher. funny, attendance is important, and he understands that no one really cares about the classes he teaches enough to take it completely serious. he's a good guy but semi-hard grader",completely average. he's really tall,"This class sucked!  With Dr. Sionean and Charles not knowing what they want from week to week is was ridiculous.  If you need a Comp II Charles was alright in discussion and VERY helpful, but wait for Farner for lecture...Much easier",This class is a joke in how easy it is...Charles is a great teacher and I would recommend it to anyone looking to laugh and do next to nothing.  Only downside was that attendance was an important part of the grade,Great Class....

1417600,1.8,Nicole,Holtzclaw-Stone,8,0.3540982381930416,"Bad lecturer - Just reads from her paper. Pay close attention to what she says though because her powerpoints are VERY bare, so you're not quite sure what to take notes on. It's an easy class but someone should inform her that it's a blow-off class, cause she doesn't seem to have gotten the memo. It's interesting material but she makes it boring.","I was interested in the course material and could still barely pay attention because she just reads off her powerpoints and isn't a great lecturer. I skimmed the readings and did well on all the assignments. Most interesting part for me was the group project about a community resource, but that's obviously hit or miss depending on your group.","You want to be interested in the class, but it's taught so horribly that you can't be.  I was surrounded by intelligent people who never got the chance/encouragement to participate.  Her lectures are embarrassingly unsophisticated.  It's a miserably dead class. It takes an immense amount of effort to learn anything, you're taught nothing.","I was interested in the material of the class from the beginning. However, this class was so easy that it was hard to want to attend. Be aware that the professor will try to screw you over whenever possible. Watch out, she seems nice, but will find some way to ruin your class experience. I don't recommend this class because of this.","How to get an A in this course: do minimal amount of work.  If you are looking to take an interesting course or learn about anything at all, keep looking. Definitely an easy A course, and know that reading ANY of the assigned readings is unnecessary. She reads her notes directly from paper, and can't elaborate on anything.  Ask anyways, it's funny.",No clear guidelines on papers which are a major portion of the course. Didn't learn anything in class but was forced to go due to iclicker points.,Honestly the worst teacher I have ever had. She reads all of her notes off of a piece of paper she typed out and when you ask a question she cannot elaborate because she has no idea what she is talking about. Her prompts for essays are not clear at all! I can honestly say I learned NOTHING in this class.,The class is called Global Inequality and Social Change. She had a lot of first-hand experience on the subjects she taught which was really cool.tests are pretty much all essay and short answer which kind of sucks but overall really good class

There are a few simple points that get drilled in your head but I didn't really learn a lot about culture.  She is so cute though.  I get the same feeling looking at her as I do a stuffed animal or a puppy.  She is always smiling and very nice.,"In this class we never saw her, we were just taught by TAs. The TAs give biweekly quizzes that they write and the professor writes the midterm and final. The material isnt that hard but you still either have to come to class or read the text to do well. Her midterm was easy but the final was tougher bc it referenced specific examples from the book","Easy class. Her powerpoints are all you need. The lectures are basically explaning the powerpoints, so you don't really need to go. She gives plenty of extra credit too. Class content is interesting stuff- not too bad. I would take it just to get the A.","Near to unintelligble. Very difficult to follow and the course materials were not very well organized. Never before have I had a class where every time I went I had the strong urge to get up walk out. Many, many others actually did so every single class. I did not enjoy her section at all, and hope the next section of this class will be better.",She has a very thick accent and is very difficult to understand.  She is not very receptive to questions and will not listen if you try to question about a test score.  Your best bet is to teach yourself the material based off her slides.,Gave several opportunities for extra credit. Very nice.
1205714,1.9,Seung-Hyun,Hong,6,0.21401997483954735,The class is not that bad at all. He reads the lecture slides and the tests are almost the exact same as the examples in the slides. The final project could be difficult if you don't know how to use a statistical program like stata or sas.,Worst professor I've seen...,THE TOPIC WAS INTERESTING. DESPITE MANY MATHEMATICS INVOLVED THE EXAMS WERE FAIRLY EASY AND STRAIGHT FROM LECTURE NOTES. IF YOU DON'T LIKE DOING LOTS OF MATH DON'T TAKE THIS CLASS.,"He talked quietly and quickly as he mumbled everything on the board and did not explain where he got any of his information or equations from. He was not helpful at all and even though he knows a lot about the subject, he does not teach it well at all.",Worst Mistake ever! I actually withdrew. I hate a professor who makes Econ boring and bland because I love Economics. All he does is write meaningless equations on the board and just assumes we get it.

Personally I learned more from the prelectures than i did from the actual lectures because I could stop and take notes.","He is good at explaining the material and knows his stuff well. The class has the same structure as all 200 level physics courses, and they have put a lot of thought into the class's structure.","Professor Hooberman is such a cool guy that if you're picking Phys 212 you should take his class.

Really nice guy and genuinely interested in his subject. Ryan was a great ta!,"I loved Will!! The class was kind of hard for me because I don't know anything about political systems, which he focuses a lot on... but he was VERY helpful! Get Luis as a TA!","He is so nice and I love that he loves what he does. He has a passion for this subject and it makes me feel bad I missed his lectures. The material is pretty dry and I do no't think it's as easy as everyone says it is. MY t.a. was Luis and he was HILARIOUS!!! It's a good class, just get Luis as your T.A. and READ READ the material!!",This guy is awesome and engaging. He's genuinely interested in what he teaches which permeates to the students. I'm not an LAS major but it made me want to take more classes. His tests are very fair but the class requires a good amount of reading... most of the time interesting. TAs are very personable along with William himself. Awesome class!,The class was easy and I got an A. He is content giving everyone an A; he is more so worried about changing your view point on a subject.,will is an AMAZING teacher! he's very interested and knowledgeable in what he teaches. he makes (or tries to make) all lectures appealing. REALLY enjoyed his class on a subject i wasn't crazy about. he provides lots of information that can lead to better understanding,"Will is a pretty bad lecturer, but this is a great class to take to fill the nonwestern requirement.  I hardly went to class because complete notes were always available online and his lecturing is useless.  Regardless, it was still interesting and I did learn a lot and it was actually worth taking.",No Comments,"AWESOME CLASS. It really opens your eyes to US foreign policy, particularly in terms of Latin America. He is very passionate about his class. Its easy, but you actually learn things in this class. I highly recommend this class for gen ed requirements."

Super easy class if you know a bit stats.","Hands up a great Professor that really cares about his students. Yes, his voice has a countryside accent and its monotonous. There is a lot of homework but its a GREAT alternative to ECon 202 &amp; 203 (by far one of the hardest classes in here).However, he curves the tests, drops the lowest one and gave option to redo questions on 1 test if wanted! :)",Easy Class,"Monotone Voice. He is a nice guy, but the material is boring. The tests are pretty hard but he does offer a lot of extra credit and a huge curve. Its a great alternative to the Econ 202/203 because getting a good grade is very possible. The classes are just really boring and reading the book is probably a good idea.","He's a pretty good teacher, you don't even have to pay attention to his class, but you do need to read through the chapters to understand the material, moderate homework load and test difficulty."

If you are thinking of dropping this class, watch out. That's all I am saying.","He was a great teacher, though his tests were rediculous.You had to memorize at least a hundred pictures for the 3 exams and you only got tested on 5, the rest of the exam included essays. Go to the lectures, they're interesting. The discussion sections were very helpful. Good class but the exams were too hard, notecards helped me.","The class was definitely hard, but he was such a knowledgeable guy and so interested in the topic himself, he made the class great. Definitely go to lecture! Definitely read the text! Also now he sends out emails with what to study for the exams (which are pretty hard,but manageable as long as you study).","He's a nice guy and pretty funny, but he doesn't tell you what he expects and he expects you to know everything he does. He is however a very knowledgeable guy.","He's a nice enough guy but I think his problem is that he knows the material so well that he forgets the class is learning this stuff for the first time. The test would have been easier had he actually sent everyone in the class the email that contained what we'd be tested on (yeah, I was one of those he forgot).","Pretty good professor, sort of hard to understand what you will be tested on, but if you study you'll be fine."

The assignments felt much more like situations one might run across professionally, where there is no manual or hand-holding. Besides, she was always prompt with e-mails in the event a question did present itself.","she was amazing, the best professor I have had in this program. the other student who rated her makes a fair point about the assignments but I learned more in this class then I expected and it was actually enjoyable!","Very disorganized. Her lectures are good and she has a lot to offer, but her course materials and assignment descriptions fall short. There are no assignment descriptions aside from the title. It is difficult to discern what she wants out of assignments and what her grading criteria are. Be prepared to work your ass off for 2 credits."
471038,3.2,John,Hough,17,0.43450536026266917,"This class is very interesting but a lot of hard work. Do not slack off, he does not do the plus/minus grading scale, just solid A,B,C,D,F. Attendance gives bonus points and there is also a bonus long-term memory exam. Beware: Dr. Hough is very prone to tangents and is indecisive. Class was poorly organized, especially w/Open labs and clarity.","You really do have to have an epiphany about this stuff or this course is going to be unnecessarily difficult. Get real, work hard. I bombed the first 2 exams because I underestimated the work. By the end I was a pro and you will be too. Med/Nursing/OT/PT/Pharm school is tough and if you can't handle this class don't even bother applying.","The soon-to-retire Hough is an okay guy, but he can't for his own life stay germane to the topic and always goes on completely irrelevant tangents.  Easy to get an A with all the extra points. Syllabus is too verbose and is 50 pages.  Very disorganized fellow. The class is annoying and too much work but take it, it's easy to get a good grade.","Dr.Hough is a real funny guy. He tells random stories in class. Lecture is extra credit. He comes off as condescending, but he is just trying to get his students to learn the material. He also gives an extra credit long term memory exam. Most of the class gets A and B. Don't do nething stupid and end up as  the subject of one of his random stories",Dr Hough is hilarious..he tells these stories that really have no point to them and laughs at himself for a while after. Hes awesome and a great teacher! He really makes the material more clear..but you have to go to the lecture to really understand it. Hes a little intimidating but really knowledgable. OKAAY! Its a miracle! NO ITS NOT! haha,"This class was an absolute nightmare, lectures are extra points so make sure you attend but reading on your own is the only way to understand anything. Unless you want to spend your weekends, (at least 7+ hrs) in open lab, I'd suggest NOT taking this class because you WILL NOT DO WELL!!",Dr. Hough is a great teacher and tries to make his class very fair for students. His stories are hilarious and makes attending lectures fun. This class is highly recommended for any pre-professional students and with enough effort you can easily achieve an A.,"Dr. Hough is a nice guy but a terrible teacher!  He is never clear and the notes are worse, but he gives you the old exams.  Study from those and go to open lab and you'll be fine.  Lecture attendance is extra credit, so go sign in and do a soduku or have someone sign you in.",Dr. Hough is extrememely knowledgeable and the lecture notes that he provides are straight to the point. Going to lab and open labs are a must. Dont think that you can get away with studying everything out of the Atlas alone.,He knows what he's talking about. Read the lecture notes before going to class so that going to class is a review. People who say that he can't teach go in expecting to be taught- Dr. Hough's lectures are meant to clarify and reiterate things from the book. The lecture notes themselves are well written and explain the material well.,"Hough is a great teacher. Go to open lab and you will be fine. Lecture exams are all true false questions so technically nobody should get below a 50%. You can usually do decent by studying some, but for the lab practicals, you must go to lab and study the terms.","I dont recommend this class for Gen Ed, pick something easier.  But if its a requirement then prepare yourself.  Dont fall behind on the stuff cuz its harder to catch up.  Dr. Hough is HILARIOUS.... okay...... (u'll get it when u c him)  lol   anywho... try 2 go 2 class and try 2 sit in front so u wont fall asleep.","DR. Hough is a genius and knows everything about human anatomy.  The class is difficult but if you can memorize a lot of stuff, you will easily get an A.  Most people get an A in the class.  I think you have to be a moron to get a C.  Dr. Hough is also very sarcastic and can be funny at times.  The key is to go to lab. Highly recommend the class.",He's kinda crazy.  I think he does have good knowledge of anatomy but he doesn't know how to teach very well or clearly.  You definently need to study and keep up with the material but if you go to class (you get extra credit) it's not terribly hard to get an A (about 40% get A's),"IT is a hard class, but their are plenty of opportunties for extra points here and there. Professor is kinda funny. Go to class, you get extra points. This course requires you to study ALOT.","I don't care about fish and animals, this is a HUMAN anatomy class!","Although Dr. Hough knows what he's talking about, he doesn't know how to teach any of his material. Unless you can manage advanced biology material in a class with horrible instruction, don't even think about taking this class."

The band is becoming more commercialized, as it probably needs to, but the shows performed are not at the same calibre they once were. I hope that as he continues to learn that quality will again be prioritized.","Great guy. Upbeat and easy going most of the time. He can get pretty serious and angry every once in a while, but its usually deserved.","Overall great guy. He always will make time for you if you want to talk. He is doing wonders for the Marching Illini &amp; the music program.  He wants to make the band more involved and become much better than it currently is. At times he might seem a little intense, but that is because people don't understand how great he truly wants the band to be.","Does work well with the Marching Illini, and has brought us into the future.  His major flaw is that he doesn't use logic very well. He makes illogical decisions.  Also, does not keep his word, and will go back on it.",Professor Houser is a fantastic leader of the Marching Illini. I know that the MI wil only become better in the years to come.

The exams are open-ended questions that don't have much to do with the textbook (general knowledge will suffice). Much easier than other history course options, but may not be the best gen-ed option. Quizzes are very point-specific to the textbook.","Quizzes in discussion section extremely specific to textbook.  Tests not relevant to anything in the textbook; not fact-based whatsoever.  Make sure you like to think creatively/analytically.  Clicker questions for attendance points.  Try your best to listen in class, not extremely interesting though.","HORRIBLE professor. If you do not have the same opinion or manner of thinking as him, you are wrong. Extremely opinoinated and biased. I thought that this class would be easy, but after a lot of work I feel like I've learned absolutely nothing and wasted time.","Interesting lectures, fair grader. You MUST read the book and go to class.","This class is really interesting and covers all aspects of U.S. History. Not difficult to get an A, just go to lectures and he'll point out what you need to know. Do the readings.","Very clear, and has great knowledge of the subject. Very friendly, one of my favorite classes.","I really like his lectures. A little hard to follow sometimes in lecture when he gives out outlines but, for the most part it's a fantastic class. Really like-able guy that you could definitely go to for help.",Professor Hoxie's class is one of the best classes that I've taken at U of I.  He does a really good job of being pretty apolitical.  I would recommend any class taught by him.,VERY opinionated and those who don't share his opinion will be singled out. Very confusing and hard to grasp what it is he wants or expects. Quizzes were VERY HARD and they counted a lot toward the grade. Don't wear a Chief shirt or that will get you into trouble too! Just very unlcear.,foremost authority on his subject...outstanding,"Hoxie is a giant in the field of Native American history, and his class is a great opportunity to learn about Native nations and hear their own stories, as he relies on many original sources by 20th c. Native thinkers.  Hoxie asks a lot of questions and wants you to think for yourself.  Very approachable and kind, interested in students' learning.","He's alright, nothing great though.  Don't talk during his lectures, he'll kick people out of class, even in Foellinger.",Hoxie is one of the most distinguished professors and he is great at what he does.  very interesting class and wish he taught more.,hated this class and his lectures,"hox knows his history. but often lectures were hard to follow, jumped around. instead of straight notes he uses pictures and paintings to supplement his lectures, i enjoyed this. exams were frustrating b/c you studied lots for only very short exam, but i didnt find them difficult.","His lectures were very interesting, and enjoyable, however, he does have a strong opinion and tends to have a lot of bias on many subjects. If you like to write then this is a great class to take. Overall, it was a satisfying class.",Very boring class. It's easy to get lost because it's hard to hear him all the time and he jumps around. Not very organized. Need to study 100 terms for the test but only know five. Main test questions are on lectures. A LOT of reading and A LOT of writing.

The tests are difficult though","As mentioned, your grade is likely determined by whether your TA is a hard grader or not. She's a relatively clear lecturer in terms of communicating subject content, but she doesn't stress the priority level of the content enough. Useless information aside, she's pretty hot I can't believe she doesn't have the chili pepper icon...",Really tough class.  The labs are such a pain to write and take very long to complete.  Getting a good grade in 233 is like chance due to who your lab TA is and the exams given.  Mirth is so hot though.,"Hoyt is a poor excuse for a Professor.  Bad lecturer (reads verbatim from lecture slides), takes a condescending tone, and just overall sucks.  In addition, she prepares zero to give out her poorly written exams to students.  She didn't even print out enough exams for the final so we all had to sit around waiting for an hour. DO NOT TAKE HER!","WORST PROFESSOR EVER. She talks to everyone like they are 5 years old, goes through slides way too quick, and expects too much for 2 credit hr course. TAs are useless. Didn't print enough exams for all students on final, so left for an hr while everyone cheated that got the exam at check in, then never came back. Good luck, you'll need lots of it.",Awful teacher. She is extremely rude and does no explain anything. She also expects you to know everything and talks down to you when you don't. Talks to everyone as if she was talking to mentally challenged people or 2 year olds. I end up leaving lecture early every time because she is so annoying an an awful teacher.,Totally don't understand what she's talking about.  Thankfully the TA is soooo helpful

For RST 150 you don't need to read the book he tells you exactly what you need to know on the lecture slides. He doesn't post them online so you should team up with someone in the class or I guess he would probably just give them to you. Has text review/tests in class.,He's super nice and know a lot about tourism. Easy A!,"Taking 150 with Nick was awesome. He's traveled all over the world, and he has the best stories. I actually looked forward to going to class! Also... He's hot. WAY hot.","Great teacher, very helpful, he makes class fun! Also.... crazy hot. could it get any better?!

Not bad, but not great, and the class as whole has a system that's very difficult to get used to.","Great Professor! She does care about the students, which can't be said for all professors. The lectures  and tests are pretty straight forward. Can be tough at times during design reviews but she's just challenging you to make a better design. If you like to design and build than you'll like this class. I would recommend her as an advisor as well.",Not helpful and does not give credit unless you do it the way she wants.,I was told she was good and taught well but I think something has changed. Her lectures are not too helpful when asking her questions. She has in-class assignments but you can figure out when because she posts them on her lectures so you just have to look ahead of time. Homework started easy but got harder and is not really covered on the tests.,"One of the better professors Ive had. For most of the course she explained the material pretty well, but at the end she seemed to burn out. Exams were easy and focused on the basics of the material. The course was mainly centered around the two design projects and she discussed them a lot in class which was helpful.","She did a decent job teaching the class.  Lectures were pretty good.  Tests were extremely easy,  which was fine but also means no curve.  I think ME 370 was one of those classes that nobody really hates, but nobody really likes it either.  Just do the homeworks and don't fall too far behind."

But overall he is pretty good, at least better than other ECE440 lecturers.","Professor Hsieh is possibly one of the greatest professors I've had in ECE.  He makes the ece440 material easy to understand, its very caring to students, and cares more about the student than the grade.  I wish he taught more classes!

Dr. Hu is a great professor, is incredibly intelligent, is NOT hard to understand, and the class does teach EXCELLENT information in the topic of Ecosystem Ecology. This class was great, not too difficult, and I learned a lot. Never read the text book but will keep it for a resource.",I would have to disagree with previous comments. I took his course this past fall and found the course very interesting and engaging. His accent is not very thick at all. I even have bad hearing and there was never a point when I did not understand him. He is also one of my advisors and I have found him nothing other than approachable.,"He is hard to understand most of the time, but his random pronounciations make it more entertaining. The class is kind of all over the place, with no real connection between materials.","He is very knowledgeable on the subject, but has the proficiency of a 1st grader in speaking English.  Luckily the material is very easy and an A+ is almost guaranteed with the curve.","It wasn't a horribly difficult class, but lectures were pretty boring and I found myself just relocating to sleep.  He has a pretty thick accent, but was fairly understandable.  His tests were fair if you read the book and reviewed your notes.  85-100 was an A so I wasn't complaining.  Class is pretty excruciating but not difficult to do well in.",very hard to understand! the exams are farily easy... he is willing to help. He tries to crack some jokes but that does not turn out too well because you cant understand what he is saying.,"I think he is a pretty good Prof, but he goes WAY in depth about paticular subjects and makes it really boring. I found it hard to know what to study for his exam. His exam is pretty fair and straightforward. Of course, there is his infamous accent, it could get annoying!","So damn hard to understand, no personality whatsoever","extremely difficult to understand, and extremely boring",i'm usually super bored during lectures-and i'm a bio major! material is not introductory as it should be-puts way too many charts and graphs it is overwhelming. covers obscure details instead of big picture ideas which the course should be seeing as it is a 100 level course,Class was fun and material was explained in great detail. great class.,"Quite possibly the worst professor to teach an undergrad course ever.  Even if you manage to stay awake through the incredibly boring material, good luck understanding him at all.","oh...my...God...can this man be any more boring and difficult to understand? One of the worst profs I have ever had, and I've had many",can't understand him at all. hard exams that don't really pertain to lecture. very boring class in general.,"He's very difficult to understand and his material puts us all to sleep:( Seriously, could you possibly make ecology ANY more boring?","I could never understand anything he said.

He seems incredibly smart too.",Very intellectual and has a good understanding of the concepts. Talk to him and you won't regret it.,He is good professor and knows his material really well. He can come across as arrogant and sometimes mean. However if you super nice to him his help goes a long way. I would recommend for any other class though as he is a very smart man.,Super easy A+,He is awesome!!! Give out a lot of A's.,"He is clever but arrogant. Assume everyone should as clever as him. And it is hard to talk to him, unreachable. If you have chance, switch your section.",Extremely brilliant professor!,"very good professor, but the test was hard",Brilliant professor! I worship him!,"Hu is so clever a professor that he assumed every student should be as clever as him. Oh wait, he even sent out an alarming email to everyone just before the final. When the averages of midterm 3 were out, you can't believe your eyes. They were 34, 23.4 and 27. What a wonderful professor!","This teaher has really bad morality, need to skip all of his class, be careful",Really Horrible teacher,"Really knows what he's talking about. He will proceed quickly and runs lecture assuming you come in with an understanding of the assigned readings. He's there to reinforce information more than teach it. Kind and understanding outside of a general class setting (office hours). Covers material quickly, but don't be afraid to stop and ask questions","He was an excellent professor who understood the course material perfectly.  He always kept the lectures interesting, and often connected material to practical applications.  (Please take comments saying otherwise with a grain of salt.  Many bad reviews this semester are from students upset about an email he sent regarding cheating.)","Unlike most professors, Hu knows beyond what is simply taught in the course and it is clearly exemplified in his teaching. What most professors wouldn't be able to get away with, Hu manages to maintain with a superior ego that is exemplified by his practical skills. This professor truly cares and is motivated regarding integrity of his class.","I found Hu's lectures to be much more exciting and informative than LeMay's. I really enjoyed having him as a professor, despite the fact that he coded quickly.","Very smart professor, but be warned. He will proceed quickly and is a little cocky (he can back it up though). For 190, I found Hu &gt; LeMay, as he kept it interesting. People are still angry about the poorly worded option to confess email. He apologized about that. A real man knows when he made a mistake. So forgive him. Make sure you read the book!","He's a really bright teacher. Sometimes his lectures aren't communicated well (either because the topic is difficult or he types code too quickly), but if you read the book beforehand everything is a lot more clear. I think people underestimate the usefulness of the book in the first few weeks. This course is fast paced though. Count on that.",He is an extremely smart guy so if you are well above average I strongly recommend you to go to his lectures.  You should teach yourself about the basics and use his a lecture as an extension. You learn way much stuff in his class.

Go to class because there are random quizzes and in-class assignments.",Professor Hualde may ramble a little bit in lecture but it's because he's insanely knowledgeable about the topic. He's super nice outside of class too and will talk about whatever topic in linguistics you want!,"Professor Hualde is passionate about his field and approaches teaching as an opportunity to inspire students rather than a chore. His lectures are always interesting, and his expectations are clear. You will have to work hard to get an A, but there is no guesswork about what will be in the tests.",Fantastic instructor. He made me want to learn and understand a subject that I was not interested in prior to taking the class. He is very clear and so nice and helpful.,Fantastic instructor. Always excited to be teaching and spreads that excitement. Will go out of his way to help his students. It's important to go to class because only outlines of course material are made available. Read the articles he assigns. The textbooks are useful but less important if you go to class. Exams are not difficult if you keep up.

It is so much more effective to come to her class in order to learn the language.,"Great Teacher and makes Chinese enjoyable. Although I don?t know too much about the other CHIN 201 teachers, I would recommend that you take Yiju?s class ? She is especially effective in teaching Grammar and I honestly believe you will be better off learning Chinese from her. During class, my advice would be to Always be respectful and courteous.",I love her class!!!  She rocks ^_^!,"very smart and courteous teacher. gradiing is strict but fair. does not show favoritism to students, but does appreciate genuine interest and hard work.","Awesome teacher and a really fun class--you do a lot of talking, skits, games, etc.  She calls on you even if you aren't raising your hand.  Chinese is hard but Huang laoshi (teacher) makes it probably as easy as it can be.","First of all she is crazy beautiful as well as damn cute. Her teaching style is very organized and very effective.

What she tested is always beyond the HW and practice exam. This class makes me feel so stressful. I never did so bad in a stat class, and I really think this has something to do with the way she teaches.",Very hard to understand with a thick accent. Lectures are just a cluster. Practice exams and homework not representative of what she tests over. Very few big picture and practical takeaways from the course. I recommend a more econometric based course in time series for anyone interested in the field.,"Absolutely terrible.  I didn't listen to the comments about this professor and I wish I had.   I seriously question her qualifications to teach for several reasons: sloppy handwriting, incomplete lecture slides, using different notation from a variety of textbooks and exams that are awfully discouraging.     I have nothing positive to say about her",Extremely hard course. Great emphasis on mathematical proof and theory.,I just did't know what she is talking about. All the notes are messed up. She wrote all the things on board and seldom use software. I learned all the proof but nothing practical.,Her exams were very hard.Although she promised otherwise. I remember an erratic curve at the end of the class.,"Just cannot understand why does STAT Department hire such an Unprofessional Visiting lecturer to teach so many STAT 400 level courses. Her course material are completely incomprehensible! Amount of Assignments she gives are crazy, redundant and tedious. I'm strongly suspect whether she really has qualified STAT fundamental skill in teaching!","Though she is very nice and patient to help, she talks quickly and not quite clear. the materials are difficult to understand. a lot of homework, 2 midterms,1 final project and 1 final exam. Definitely not recommended unless you like challenge","Even though a lot of people says this or that, she is very nice on the giving grade and giving chance to let students improve their grade. I am just saw a student who didnt take first exam by some acceptable reason so she moved his exam grade into 3rd exam. She is very nice in office hour as well.",Her accent makes it very difficult to understand the material. It would be better to just read the slides on your own. I wouldn't recommend her at all.,This class is stupidly time-consuming and is almost not worth taking.  The professor is next to useless and assigns more homework than all of my other classes combined.,It's not bad.

I don't know who doesn't. She's such a bubbly person and every lecture was a joy, watching her enthusiasm! There's no other professor better suited to teach the Intro class full of first-years who fear college professors. She's caring, always wants to help and I would take the class over and over again!

Honestly this was my favorite class of the semester and I just enjoyed the class overall.,"Everything is taught in lecture, and what you see in lecture will be 100% the same on the Homework, so go to lecture!

Get help early, studying for this class is very different than high school.","Dr. Huang doesn't explain concepts very well in class. She goes over concepts and then expects us to learn in-depth on our own. Her exams were very difficult, but she had online re-takes that could get you around 10% back. There's an average amount of homework. One thing that's good is that she has office hours for people to come and ask questions.","Overall good, I didn't find the text easy or hard, it's what I expected. I just did the homework problems and go to lecture.","Huang was decent in lecture but left out lots of important info. I went to her office hours to get help on book problems and she didn't know how to solve them. She also made fun of and was condescending of people when they asked questions. Her tests had lots of trick questions (i.e a change in wording, not really testing the material). Thumbs down.","CHEM 102 is notorious for being the weed out class. Dr. Huang's tests are, for the most part, pretty straightforward however she likes to add A LOT of trick questions that don't even really ""test"" the concepts you study for. I never found lectures to be helpful. I would take advantage of TAs and the CLC for learning concepts and asking questions.","Her lectures aren't great but her tests are straightforward. In other words, get ready to do a lot of learning on your own if you want to do well in the class. The other professors are most likely better lecturers with more difficult exams. So take that how you want, personally I'd rather learn the material than deal with her lectures.","Her tests are exponentially harder than any of the homework or quizzes given, but she's a really reasonable professor. I missed my last midterm and she helped me figure out how to still do well in the class. She just over complicates things during lectures and then makes the tests really hard without a curve.",She was the best of the worst Chemistry teachers at uiuc. I didn't like her but try your luck.,Tina Huang is a good professor. Her lectures are pretty fun because of her demonstrations and humorous personal anecdotes. You will definitely have a strong foundation in general chemistry after taking her class. It is definitely an easy A as long as you study appropriately.,"Her tests, like all chem 102 teachers, are VERY DIFFICULT. Prepare yourself with the practice test, and be ready for trick questions. We used a free online textbook - which nobody read anyways. And lecture is mandatory, along with a no-technology policy during lecture. She assumes that you already know a lot of what she's talking about.","Tina Huang did a great job with explaining the various concepts. Her lectures were always fun to attend because of her: experiments, sense of humor, and I-clicker points which is extra credit. Her downfalls are the exams may have material that weren't touched on in lecture and her practice exams don't reflect what is on the actual exam.","Tina Huang is worse than most any of the chem professors. If you are reading this, take anyone BUT her. This is your sign. I went to her office hours and she called me ""extremely challenged"" and that I shouldn't be at U of I. Im not even lying. Just dont do it, Take tricky Tom before her",One of the toughest class I had my first semester in college. But Dr. Huang was helpful when I went to her with questions. I had AP chem in high school and I still struggled. The final exam really helped with my final grade.,Tina is hilarious. Chem 102 is hard with any professor so don't expect it to be easy. The way she explains things is straight forward and easy to understand (as easy as Chem 102 can be). Would definitely recommend,"Workload is a lot. Tests are all multiple choice and can be very unfair as one small mistake can cause a wrong answer, even if you understand the content. Definitely do not rely on the practice tests being anything like the real exam as usually the real exam is way harder and specific. Offers ""exam retakes"" but it barely gives you any points back.","Dr. Huang is great, she helped me through the course when I got sick and got a little behind. Go to office hours and ask questions, she will take the time to make sure you understand the concept. The CLC is also good and you can get the answer key to the problems.","Dr. Huang is available to help. When CLC gets busy, I just go up and see if she is available. Exams are not hard if you do the problems.","She makes a lot of academic mistakes during lecture and makes things hard to understand.

His class material is interesting - he presented it in a way that expanded my curiosity.  He challenged me and fostered the growth of my analytically thinking abilities.  After receiving a 340 on my first exam with him, he taught me study methods that lead to me getting an A- in his class.  GOAT prof.","As a computer science major taking this class, I was pleasantly surprised by the amount of CS-related topics in the second half of the semester. Some bits on AI, machine learning, neural networks, computability, and information, number, and probability theory. 3 tests, 3 quizzes, one of each is dropped. No homework. Go to lecture or you'll fail.","INSANELY HARD. If you've never had an interest in psych or cog sci, don't bother. It's crosslisted and should NOT be because it's really out of reach for most regular PHIL students.

The class is very difficult and confusing at first, but she is patient and will help during office hours.","I really enjoyed professor Hummel. She was such a sweet person, and thought very efficiently. The only hard part was the material. She really challenges you, and teaches you extremely difficult material.

He honestly has a bad rep cuz people dont want to study. Hes a nice professor. And YES he is TRICKY TOM but if u do the practice tests U CAN CONQUER THIS BEAST.,"Good lecturer. Course notes/booklet is very concise and teaches you chemistry well. Exams require studying and practice, but are very fair and representative of HW and lecture material. However, the curves also really suck on them, as anything about 85% and above has virtually no curve, while you need a total score in the 90s to recieve an A.","Hummel is an amazing lecturer. The class is pretty fast-paced but he is always willing to meet with students outside of office hours. Tests can be hard to do super well on because of tricky wording, but he gives you everything you need to do well. The class is unnecessarily difficult but if you put in the work it's very possible to do well.","Nice and interesting Prof though making tricking multiple choice exams. Even if you know everything you may still get an unpleasant grade in exams. He scales exams with some normal-distribution-like ways so if you score a 20 you get bumped to somewhere near 50 or 60, but if you score like a 88 or 91 there's very little curve.","Professor Hummel legit made me like chemistry. I struggled in my high school chemistry classes and hated the subject because of my awful teachers. He was different, taught with enthusiasm and managed to fit so much material in 50 minute lectures without making it feel rushed. Still requires a lot of work, and remember to do every HW assignments.",TRICKY TOM BACK AT IT AGAIN WITH THE TRICKIEST TESTS POSSIBLE!!!,"He moves through the material quickly, but will explain most things clearly. He gives a lot of practice exams, and if you do those and the practice problems in the book, you can do well on the exams.","Hummel lives up to his name Tricky Tom, but he's not as bad as most people say. Everything in the class is easy except for the tests. The tests are written specifically to make you believe you have the right answer, but in reality you don't. Go to lecture every day because he covers a lot of material the TA's don't.","I really enjoyed Professor Hummel. He was a fair teacher in terms of laying out what was expected in his class. Lectures are very interesting. This class was a challenge, but I was in AP Chem so be prepared to work hard.","""Tricky Tom"" is known for his tough exams but they are not impossible. If you don't get something that went on in lecture get help at the CLC, his office hours, or your TA's office hours. All his exams are scaled which helps a lot. Homework is worth a lot in the end so as long as you do that you shouldn't do that bad. GO TO LECTURE, handouts book&gt;","Professor Hummel is actually a pretty good teacher especially one on one. Go to office hours even if you only have one question. Honestly, I don't think the material is all that difficult, but the exam questions can be unreasonably hard. You need to go to every single lecture and discussion if you want to do well in this class. Study hard.",Classes are interesting with experiments and jokes. Clear about what will be tested. Tests are easy as long as you are clear about the concepts (knowing why instead of only understanding the formulas and calculations). Answers questions super clearly if you go to him after class. Rated poorly only because people who don't study much suffers.,"Thought Tom was rude and just an overall poor professor. Tom was definitely the worst professor I had during all my years at Illinois. Wouldn't recommend Tom to anyone, he's just a nightmare to say the least. I regret every moment I spent in that class. If I could go back I definitely would have taken the class with any other professor except Tom.",Decent professor. exists very well. has not phased out of class. always there to hand out money (so make sure to answer questions).,"He provided lots of help to students including answering e-mails at any time, providing past exams... But his tests are little bit hard. Need to study hard.","From what I heard about other chem 102 professors, Hummel is definitely a solid choice. He goes over example problems consistently in lecture and has cool demos. Although there is a fair amount of work for the class, he's good at teaching it!","Honestly, it wasn't bad. Hourly exams are same difficulty levels as past hourly exams. so get them done ahead of time. Also, do all homework questions (including recommended ones). Do homework after lecture. don't slack off.","Very test heavy class, which is very unfair  considering his tests are both tricky as well as low on time.  If chemistry is a weak spot for you, try to take 101 first.  When you get to this class, make sure you take a couple hours out of your week to just revise, this class will kick your ass if you don't put in work.","Hummel was really great.  As long as you do the practice exams and the bookwork, you'll be okay.",Do NOT take his Chem102 class if you do not have a strong chem background. By far the most difficult Chem102 professor.

Love his jokes .. lol,"His expectations for his studends are very high, as they should be. But he needs to understand that we all are taking 4 technical classes right now and simply don't have the time to study these concepts to the level that we should and would like to. It saddens me that I can't do better in this class. I simply don't have the time.","Very good professor, has a great sense of humour and will build up tough concepts slowly before busting out the math.  Excellent ability to answer questions.","He is so good, And so crazy, and we all love him.","Made lectures enjoyable with his sense of humor.  On exams, his questions were by far the most relevant and manageable compared to those from the other professors teaching the class.  Did lots of examples in class that were very relevant to homework and exam questions.  Oh, and don't be late to class, or he'll mock you.  Looking forward to ECE 470!","He is crazy!!! Rubbish talk to students before a exam, you can imagine how out of mind he is.","If you've had programming experience and ECE 110, the class won't be that hard. Still, as an ECE course is can be challenging at times. Seth is a fun teacher, but has trouble writing examples on the blackboard, which gets very confusing when they're so long. MPs are more long than difficult. Don't bother going to him for help.","this guy doesnt care about students. he never answers clearly to students when people ask. He seems to be a nice guy in lecture, making unfunny jokes but when you see him personally, he acts totally different. I hate this professor the most at UIUC. Patel is million times better than him.","His ability to teach the material is ok, but in general I would not recommend him. He's purposely rude to students and seems to enjoy it which I found really annoying. Doesn't really go out of his way to accommodate students.",He does come off as a jerk because he is very smug. But he will keep you awake.,This guy is a self righteous jerk.  He is also an advisor and has never been helpful.

Its his way or the highway. Three kids dropped the class after the the first week. I promise you I NEVER have angry feelings towards teachers.... But this guy... Takes the first and only cake.,"I don't know how Gordon Hutner gets 17 blank stares for the entirety of every class, but he does. No one is interested cause all he wants to do is hear himself talk. He comes with no lesson plans and just blabs about whatever comes to mind. He doesn't make sense, his grading does not make sense, I'm not a better writer, I've learned nothing","I have mixed feelings about Hutner. When he returns your papers, you can tell that he certainly takes the time to give advice on how to make them better. But that's really expected from all English professors. I also agree with others that he talks a little too much. Other English professors I had did more by saying less.","Nightmare. The book list was pretty interesting, but god forbid if you don't like one of them. He loves to hear himself talk but doesn't make coherent points. His prompts are convoluted. He tends to railroad any discussion into what he wants you to say. Pass.","He's very intimidating. Definitely opinionated. The class is supposed to be discussion-based, but he cuts you off often. The guy is obviously smart, but he makes sure you know it. Don't tell him you dislike the books, because he'll go on a tangent about how you're wrong. Not a terrible class, but if you can avoid it, do. Great book list, though.","Interesting take on modern novels- great thing about it- we are the first to critique. Opinionated,multi-dimensional man who always makes time to help his students out. Reading load is heavy, but only asks of 2 E-responses per book. 2 essays and a few short analysis here and there. Go to class. Do your work. You'll do just fine.","Professor Hutner loves to hear himself talk. He says things that sound intellectual but rarely have much meaningful substance.  He does not like to be challenged and tends to respond to student comments/questions by using them to launch into his own ideas.  I found the reading load heavy, and the discussions discouraged me from staying involved","You read 8 books, and have to do e-responses on each. he gives a few pop quizzes so at least have an idea of what is going on. there are no tests, and not a final, you have to read a book on your own and write 3 seperate papers (about 6 pages each) comparing your book to the books in class. pretty easy class for 200 level LA","Hutner is a dick. He gives one set of directions then changes his mind and makes you redo the damn assignment. Does not listen to anyoen who has a different opinion than his own- either agree or shut up. Teachers at a grad school level, always confuses his students. Try to avoid his class if you can"

He teaches a wide range of material that is actually useful for future engineers. My favorite professor in four years of ECE by far.,"The lecture is not the best, but is definitely worth to go and listen. His knowledge of history of computer is surprisingly profound and that actually helps understanding the present concept. The only bad thing about this professor is that he is not often teaching classes.",I woke up for the interesting stories.,"Funny and interesting stories, brings a lot of experience with him, really knows his stuff well.

He explained all the grammar questions I have pretty well. I took his Span 121 class first and I loved it, and he was my instructor again by coincidence when I took Span 130.

Would better be a good actor rather than a teacher.,"The professor is amazing and always willing to help students. The course seems to be difficult at the beginning, but spend time and efforts on it, and try to understand the logic. If you understand the logic and the way of thinking, the homework and exams won't be that hard. You'll really learn something useful from this class. Worth it!!","ACCY 517 &amp; Adel are the hardest class I have ever taken, including FIN 300.  I have learned so much from ACCY 517 and it is the most beneficial class I have ever taken in my collegiate career.  He pours his passion into the subject, he slows the class down when students don't understand, he holds tons of office hours to help.","He's a really good professor, I don't usually say that I enjoyed a class, but I enjoyed Adel's teaching style and his lectures.","The class is tough, not because of the professor but the actual material. The class requires a lot of time and effort. If you don't want to put in the time and effort this isn't the class for you. What you walk away from the class is knowing how to analyze the FS of a company. A skill I will carry on with me for the rest of my life.",This professor doesn't seem to control his anger. He yelled at his students and I was always uncomfortable in his class,Worst professor ever!! Cant explain anything but ends up putting very difficult exams.. Never take any of his classes.. Screams in class all the time! Talks nonsense half of the time,"He is the worst professor I've ever had. He can't explain things clearly, but always has high expectations towards students. I guess what he wants is just making the students fail at his tricky exam. He always spends half of the class time talking about nonsense. That's why he can't catch up the class schedule or finish the class on time.","terrible course. he truly loves tricks but can never explain things clearly. always make simple things extremely hard to understand. also, he YELLED all the time.

With that said, the class was fair overall and as long as you were active in lecture, participate in discussion, and read the textbook for supplement, you will do fine.","His lecture is not clear and organized. Lab report grading is too harsh. Midterm-exam questions are difficult. If possible, don't take his course.","He tries really hard to teach but he is just not very good at explaining things during lecture. When someone asks a question, he seems confused. I'm sure he's a nice guy and all, but he is not an effective instructor. All his slides are in Comic Sans, which is painful to look at. Expect to learn everything by reading the lab manual.","Dr. Ikeda is a sweet man, but when it came to the course material he didn't know more than what was directly on the slide. Whenever anyone asked a question he either misunderstood it or didn't know the answer and just repeated what he said leaving many students unsatisfied. It sometimes felt like he didn't even know the material he was teaching.","By far, one of the worst teachers I've ever had in my life. He really knows the info, but he does not know how to teach... whatsoever. Monotone. Doesn't let you know what information to focus on or not. Exams are hell. Wastes time talking about current events. Getting an A in MCB 250 is hard enough. He makes it impossible. I'm struggling with a D..","I found Ikeda to be very helpful if you had quick questions after class, or if you went to office hours. I think he is just shy, not uncaring; in fact I truly believe he cares about his students. The material is difficult, but as long as you pay attention in lecture and take good notes, his exams are very fair.","The man knows his biology but he does not do a good job of communicating what he know to the class. He reads off the slides (which aren't even his) and barely gives his own opinion. When a student asks him a question, he seems flustered and confused and just reads off the slides again. Some times he doesn't even answer the question.",Ikeda is a nice guy but his voice just puts you to sleep. He is not a good speaker. He is ok at explaining concepts but you need to find a way to teach yourself the material so you adequately understand it. Homework assignments are tough because of the time constraint. Exams have tricky answer choices that force you to really know the info.,"Terrible lecturer. Was nice at first, but it became increasingly obvious that he doesn't really care for teaching. Exam I=cake, but the questions started getting very vague and poorly-written, and the answer choices were tricky and random. Material=simple. Tests=not representative of material/important concepts.",Not an easy A class...memorizing off the slides doesn't suffice anymore. Going to lecture also is absolutely no help.,"Mostly reads off slides. Some slides only have images and no explanation, so you have to go to those lectures, but otherwise, it's pointless.

Doesn't seem to like office hours",Possibly the worst lecturer on campus. Reads straight from the slides in a monotone voice. Test questions are ambiguous and not clearly defined.

He also gives you no idea what to study in lecture.,If you want to do good on the quizzes TAKE THEM IN GROUPS!,"Most of the questions come straight from the slide, so memorizing them backwards and forwards is a good idea.  About 10% of the exams (3 out of 33) are not on the slides.  Go to class, pay full attention, take really good notes, and memorize the slides.  I also recommend taking the online quizzes with a group of friends.  DONT BUY BOOK!",Exams are tricky and require complete memorization of all the slides.  As long as you have them memorized (word for word) you should be able to get an A.,"This is definately no longer an easy A class - expect to do some studying.

I do think this class is the best preparation homework and expectation-wise for the rest of engineering classes.

Also he focuses mostly on the eye and not the other senses. If he doesn't bump everyone up a grade at the end of the semester I will be surprised.,"He was nice. Lectures are easy to understand, participation recommended, and DO read the textbook closely since the test is really a little hard. Fortunately there are practice tests and TAs are nice.",He is very nice. This class is an introductory so it has so many things to be covered. Go to his class to get the notes or get from your friends. Attendance is not necessary. His curving is generous. Three lab reports are annoying but first two are fun. The professor is caring and willing to answer questions.,"Long chapter readings, but if you can keep up with them, you'll be fine. Online quizzes and three tests. Attendance is required at lab but not at lecture. He was very monotone but did mention things at the lecture that were not on the powerpoint. Will post powerpoint after class. Go to office hours!",Still reaping the rewards from taking this class.  The professor is boring but nice.,"I thought this class was very easy. I barely had to attend class and when i did- the lectures were not that bad. The tests are not hard if you study the practice exams. Also, the top test grades count for 2/5 of the grade where the lowest only counts for 1/5. The class is also curved. So it was easy to get an A if you put in a little effort.","DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!!! It is SO boring! It's pretty hard. Even though he gives you practice exams, the exams are terrible! I had to read every chapter and study for hours just for a B. Most other Psych classes aren't like that (and I've taken 9). He just stands up there and lectures in the same monotone voice every day- UGHH! I hated it!","Lectures are as interesting as subject matter allows, and Irwin is about the nicest man you'd want to have a professor.  The grading, however, is very difficult.  Tests are too short (no room for error) and tend to draw from moderately obscure text passages.  If you can't attend all lectures and keep up with the readings religiously, skip it.","Hardest, most boring class I've taken in college.  Tests are just like the practice tests so make sure to study those.  Only take this class if it's required!","Very funny guy, the material is pretty boring but he tries to make it fun. Tests are good if you study. Overall an ok class.","Very funny guy. Lectures aren't insanely interesting, but how interesting can rods and cones really be??? He seems to understand that the topic is only of mild interest, and tries to spice it up. Great teacher, even if the tests aren't easy, he grades on a curve to help the students out.","Very enthusiastic about perception. He's funny and is sympathetic to student's needs (ie moving a test because of a basketball game). Gives breaks every class. Tests are hard, but review sessions by the ta are very helpful.",Really fun examples in lecture! Tests are ok. Definitely need to study. But he takes some test questions right off of quizzes on the textbook website and old sample exams he gives you!,really funny...gives breaks during class

Always interested in interacting with the class to create a good learning environment and a really approachable guy.,Scott makes a point to sound like he is so intelligent. Definitely one of the worst teachers in the ACE department.

She enjoys questions and encourages participation., and is very knowledgeable on the subject to answer every question. Would recommend taking this class with a friend.","Labs are not worth 100 like someone else mentioned... theyre only worth 10. She also makes exams way more difficult than they should be. She told us that if we memorized the study guide, textbook, and lectures we still would not get a 100. She told us the exams are designed for people to get Cs. Exams are worth 65% total of the final grade.","keiko seems like a nice lady but the material is super monotonous and dense, and lectures are two hours long and really boring. the labs are easy and help boost your grade, as tests can be hard because there is so much memorization involved.",She is a great teacher. She is also very funny and always has balloons with her. The class is challenging and mostly memorization. But the labs are worth 100 points each and help a lot. The book is not used often but a lot of the answers to the labs and papers in class are straight from the book.

The most important is that real life examples shown at class and guest lecturers complement the course content very good.,"Noah is an amazing entrepenuer, but can work on his lecturing skills. It's okay though, since SOCW321 isn't lecture heavy. It's an amazing course, and Noah and the course have much room for potential.","Very cool person. Knows a lot and willing to share and engage with his students. Can meet with him at anytime to discuss things ranging from class to career plans afterwards. Because the class is relatively straightforward, you get back what you invest into the class.","He's a cool guy with awesome stories. However, he doesn't really care about you or your start up unless you're making great strides. We had problems that we pointed out and it seemed like he really didn't care. He didn't always come to class and would put other students in charge, which is fine, but we took the class for his advice. Cool course.",Noah was just an inspiring professor. He has experienced alot and he hopes to share his knowledge to all his students. I found myself inspired to do more and to accomplish great things.,"The most dedicated professor on campus, hands down.  Great guy.  Young, energetic, fun, passionate.  Brilliant.","In this class, it is not about the busy work you have to complete but rather the quality of the content you produce. Noah doesn't just assign work, he kind of inspires you to be great - when he lectures, you actually find yourself engaged by what he is saying. He resourceful, connected, and willing to help you succeed in anything. Chill guy.",Good teacher and class. It was very interesting material to learn.,Noah has created a class where you are virtually in charge of your success. It's about finding something you care about and working for it. Noah gives great support and helps you reach the goals you have for your organization with his extensive business Background. This class is not a class for a semester but a class for life with a great teacher.,"Noah can be intimidating because he is so attractive and smart, but the course is very interesting and you will learn a lot. It relates to real life.","Noah's resume is impressive and his suit game is one point, but I never felt as if I really 'connected' with him as a professor. He conveys his passion for Social Enterprise not through his expressions or evident enthusiasm, but through his actions. When he speaks to the class, he grins often as if he were hiding some secret he was soon to reveal.",One of my favorite courses at Uiuc thus far. Isserman is all about real world application and cutting out the BS. Love the class.,Isserman and this class are both really great. It is obvious that the professor really cares and is passionate about what he's teaching. Noah's also really easy to talk to if you have questions or want to know more about the subject.,"Phenomenal. Noah knows his stuff and the teaching team is amazing. If you're looking for a class that is something different and can lead to some awesome things, this is it.","A guy whose passion and knowledge of the subject comes out easily, and isn't afraid to teach in a more modern, engaging way instead of reading off a PowerPoint.","Professor Isserman is intelligent, compelling, and has tons of experience in the field! This course was one of my favorites at UIUC! There is a final project in which you create a social venture and my group continued working on it, turning it into a thriving program in the community! If you want to change the world, take this course with Isserman!",He was very helpful with individual questions and for exploring social entrepreneurship.,"Fun, helpful, and OOOO he is hottt.","Prof isserman runs a really fun and interactive class that challenged me to challenge myself to make large social impact as a student entrepreneur.

915083,2.5,Sergei,Ivanov,7,0.3582863052388539,Worst professor I've ever had. His thick accent makes his lectures very difficult to follow. He just reads from the lecture notes and hardly even looks up at the students or does example problems. Exams are pretty straightforward but going to lectures alone won't help. I honestly stopped showing up to them midway through the semester. Avoid!,"Math416 is supposed to be a proof based class while he made it more like Math415 which only has some short easy proof. He gives extra credits if you present reviews questions on the blackboard and all exams will be based on the review problems he gives us. So if you want to get easy A then go for him, if you want learn strong proofs then avoid him.",I can't understand his English! And he is not willingly to help you with the homework questions. Basically learn it by yourself. ] He even told his students this is a hard class and if you can't do so just drop it.,"I really liked professor Ivanov.  His sense of humor was...weird, but he taught the material decent enough.  The homework was fair and the tests were easy.  Before each test, he would give out ~25 problems and guarantee that the test would be made out of 6 of those only changed slightly. Overall, I learned a lot.  Review sessions are useless though","Did not learn much by going to lecture. Pretty much taught myself through the book. Overall, was not horrible. The homeworks were difficult and so were the tests; however, the final has some problems straight from prior tests and homeworks.",Got easier after alternating groups.,"His homework can be pretty tough due to the many proofs, but those are seldom graded. He has quizzes every week, but they can be cancelled at times. Gives bonus points during review sessions, and had a Thanksgiving quiz. Exams are pretty simple. They are pretty similar to the questions he emphasizes during the review and the quizzes"

827845,4.4,Anna,Ivy,13,0.6154952478398876,"I truly believe the ONLY reason Dr. Ivy is not a tenured professor is because she chose to dedicate herself to her family and teaches for the love of the material and her students. She knows her stuff and she lights up when she talks about it. She was ALWAYS available to help me, even now that I am not longer in her class.",Amazing teacher!! The most insightful teacher I have had at U of I so far.. contrary to what the person below me thinks.. She can be a hard grader but is definitely fair and only tries to benefit her students. She is very available for any extra help a student may need.Definitely take a class with Anna Ivy if you get the chance,"I'm kind of shocked at how great the ratings for Anna are. I had her for 255 and I absolutely dreaded coming to class. She had nothing new and insightful to say. We read great texts, but unfortunately our discussions in class did not do the texts justice. Almost fell asleep every class","Awesome teacher. If you're the type of person who likes to discuss or listening in on discussions, this class is definitely for you. The homework load and grading procedures are fair. You can't completely blow off the class, but if you put in the necessary work you'll be fine.","The class is pretty easy. You'll be doing a fair amount of reading/writing, but if you participate every once in a while and put forth some semblance of effort, you'll get an A. Midterm/final were very easy.","If you can, take a class with Ivy.  She brings in awesome and original analyses of the texts we read.  It's not too hard to get an A in the class if you show up, do a good job on the assignments, and participate once in a while in class. Word of advice would be to be original in papers and follow her advice in terms of how to do the midterm/final.","Prof. Ivy is AMAZING.  She's passionate and knowledgeable about her chosen novels and makes class fun to attend.  She grades fairly and if you put in the work, you should have good grades.  She's very friendly and has an amusing sense of humor.  Take a class with her if you can!","She is one of the best English professors I have had yet. She is a great teacher and genuinely cares about her students. She is not an extremely hard grader but expects good work out of her students. If you have the chance, take a class with her!","Anna is a very nice professor who is quite funny. From England, married to Prof. Barrett of 209. The class is easy you just randomnly particpate and do the work = A. Go in to see her before papers, she will get to know you and therefore like you more. Very sweet would recommend for those who like to DISCUSS the novels alot!","A good portion of your grade is participation based, which is not hard if you read the assignments. The tough parts come in writing the essays, because you're expected to be able to come up with something meaningful and original. The first exam is a time-cruncher, while the second isn't as bad. Overall, it shouldn't be too tough to get an A or B.","Super nice, funny, wonderful discussions in class.  One of the best teachers I've had at U of I.","Anna is a fairly easy grader. On the midterm, she gave credit for a wide variety of answers -- I feel like she's one of the few teachers who wants to see you do well. She gives reasonable paper assignments, relatively short (5 pages), with a couple different topics. She's funny and entertaining during class.","She likes to read into the novels WAY too much. More than half of the ""in-depth"" analysis seems like she is reaching for it. Tests are pretty easy but I felt like she graded the papers really unfairly. If you don't like talking in discussion, DONT take this class, because participation is expected."

He explains everything very well and is accessible outside of class for help with assignments.","He forces you to speak in only one way. Dumbs down every speech to where you have to restate a small fact several times over and over.

Definetly worth taking to fill a gen-ed.","Prof. Jackman was funny enough (sometimes a bit corny, but bearable) and did often make the topics really interesting. He's a good teacher overall, but he sometimes goes a bit fast while explaining difficult concepts and if you're not quick to catch on to every detail he mentions, you could easily get lost. Don't be afraid to ask lots of questions!","This was an easy Gen Ed with a great professor. The curve is amazing, 85 = A-, 71= B-.

It's essentially office hours where every day in class you work problems by yourself in small groups and he wanders around aimlessly willing to help.  Taught like 2 classes total. The class has little to do with accounting; it's a FIN class over stuff that you'll never use ever in real life.,He's maybe the best professor in accounting. His easiness score is hurt by the fact that he teaches hard classes but take him.,He is the best professor I have ever had at University of Illinois. His lectures are fun and interesting which made me excited for class each time. He made confusing topics more understandable and had very clear explanations. A very fair grader. Wish I could take every accounting class with him.,"Kevin Jackson is the BEST professor I had ever had. He is excellent at explaining class material, capturing students' attention and being patient to students when they have questions and problems. I failed the first midterm and I talked to him. He encouraged me and explained  the questions I did wrong. With his help, I got a B+ in the class.","Jackson is one of the best professors if not the best I have had at Illinois.

Attendance is encouraged to do well and make sure you take good notes to succeed","Dr. Jackson is by far one of the best professors in the College of Business, always helpful and very effective lecture style. Come to class prepared with questions and he will try his best to answer them.","Great professor. Explains material well and very approachable with questions. Grading is consistent but not easy.

If you want to get a B, just practices all the problems he posted on compass because exam questions are similar to those. All FIN 300 professors are MEAN. Projects are the same, they are SUPER HARD.","Does not answer legitimate student questions, writes numbers on the board without explaining the concepts behind them, looks for every opportunity to detract points, gives lots of busy work, and has an overall bad attitude. I received a B, but the grade should have been a B+.","He is truly not concerned with his student's grades. For example, for compass-submitted quizzes, we were worried about our answers being wrong as a result of decimal places and rounding errors and he said he wouldn't change anything and never released the quizzes for us to check it ourselves. He is pompous and doesn't answer emails.","Professor is not helpful and doesn't answer your questions. He's very vague. He gave us an exam with wrong answers and when we wasted time trying to see why we didn't get same answers as he put as multiple choice he didn't care, didn't gave us extra time and never even said sorry.

Very full of himself. The class itself isn't that hard, but there is a lot of pointless work and you'll want to kill him by the end of the semester",This is the worst professor I have had at U of I. He doesn't care at all about his students or their knowledge of the material and won't answer your guestions without sarcasm. I have to imagine that another FIN300 professor is better. Class is very difficult and time consuming. DONT TAKE JACKSON!,"It's useless to go to class. You don't really learn anything in the class. Well, the projects make you learn, but the instructor doesn't. Exams are easy if you study. Projects are hard. The easiest among all instructors.","Yeah, I agree this class is pretty much useless and you had to learn the material on your own. However, the exams weren't that hard and he basically tells you whats going to be on the exam and which questions to pay attention to. If you can figure stuff out on your own, you should be fine.","The laziest instructor in the world! you have to teach yourself. However I ended with A- in this class. Also, no Curve!","In Fin 300 it's tough to find anyone worth taking, but Jackson is the easiest of the bunch. Though he's often unclear during class, he tells you what to study for each midterm and then actually puts it on the exam (rare these days). Very helpful on class projects and a nice guy when you talk with him. Final is truly comprehensive.","^material on your own. When he does teach, it's just random examples; he doesn't teach any of the theory, and expects you to learn it all on your own for the exam. The exams are hard as a t-rex's turd. He's the second to worst professor I've ever had, which makes him the BEST FIN professor I've ever had. you should probably pick him. (worst: dyer)","Okay, first of all I think all FIN professors are useless and the worst professors in the entire university, but Jackson is probably the easiest I've had. But as for FIN professors go, that's like picking your favorite murderous dictator. The man doesn't teach diddly poo, and all he does is hand you worksheets and expect you to learn all the materi"

If you attend class, have a good attitude, and do the work, you'll get a good grade!","The professor is kind, but didn't learn much from the class. She wants to see creativity from the work and will give a low grade if it doesn't fit the grade rubric. The class material was easy and interesting.",Class is incredibly boring but you have to show up to receive points. Fridays class is an online third hour and very easy. If you do the assignments you basically automatically get points. I put very very little effort into the class and came out with an A.,"Easy class, didn't have to take final to get A.

Ends each class with classic rock quotes!","He is one of the most enthusiastic professors that I've ever had. He will get you excited about the material, but attempt to cover a bit too much. He stresses genuinely understanding the material, so exams require a lot more than regurgitating information.

Loud, clear, and enthusiastic! Always helpful.",Good instructor! Not much homework too.,too occupied to be a good instructor,"Awesome professor, I had him for ME231 back in the day.

845284,2.9,Tom,Jacobs,14,0.43782753384235024,I actually really enjoyed this class.  Prof. Jacobs gives tough exams but actually does a very good job teaching the material.  This class actually inspired me to take more plant biology classes at U of I.,Dr. Jacobs is an arrogant and horrible professor. Exams are tough for the material he covers and the questions seem to have two correct answers where guessing is your only option. His lectures are scattered and difficult to follow. He seems to explain things in the most round about way possible often leaving the class confused. Overall awful class,"Dr. Jacobs does an excellent job of belittling students in lecture.  I was afraid to ask questions because of his responses to other students. Tests are hard. Will not take a class w/ him in the future. Very boring, repetitive lectures. Too much animation on presentations. Beware of the iClicker questions.","Lab is long and sometimes pointless, assignments have vague instructions and are graded harshly. His lectures are mostly reviewing and he is arrogant.  Clicker questions are graded on correctness. Questions he asks on online quizzes and his exams are often vague and you have to choose the ""Most correct"" answer.","A great guy overall. His test questions are kind of a struggle and you sometimes have to dissect them to find the right answer, but he's a nice guy who truly loves being a professor. He loves biology and I feel like I could talk to him at length.",It's hard to believe that people are calling Dr. Jacobs a poor lecturer. He insightfully  synthesizes  information from diverse areas of research. His tests are hard because he forces you to synthesize information in the same way. Don't take his courses if you're looking to regurgitate facts. Take his courses if you want to become more thoughtful.,"Helpful, friendly prof. Focuses on concepts, not memorizing complex terms, which makes for an interesting and stimulating class. Tests are fairly hard, but doing the practice questions on Moodle helps a lot. Gives up to 6% extra credit, which is great. Awesome class overall; I learned a lot and now actually like botany.","Horrible prof. His lectures are boring, some of his test questions have multiple correct answers (but you have to choose the BEST right answer), and he is arrogant. Iclickers are used every class, but sometimes he 'quizzes' you with them on information that you did not even go over yet. Bad quality. Wish I could have gotten more from this course.",Most arrogant professor I have ever seen. He knows some old stuffs very well but is unaware of recent advancements in science. Bigger problem is- he deeply believes that he is the best professor and he needs no improvement. He has a perception that long and confusing questions can best test the students ability.,"His PowerPoints are really good but sometimes he gives a million different answers for a question/explaining a concept. It can mess you up on the exams which are really hard (in my opinion, tricky questions). Luckily he gives extra credit (super helpful!) but you definitely have to work for it. Also, the labs are super long and gets boring quick.",If you want to take a test on how well you can decipher his test questions then take his class.  Lecture and lab are so different its not even funny and the tests dont cover the material learned at all.  Overall this man is a complete idiot and doesn't deserve the job he has,"Not a bad teacher, but not the best either.  He tends to mumble during the lecture and tries to explain things in a million different ways.  He's spent way too much time making his power points and makes it easy to fall asleep in class.  The lab for this class SUCKS, very boring, lots of work, and has nothing to do with the lecture.  Thats about it","He is a good teacher, who tries to make plant biology interesting","Good and clear lecturer, but can't write exams for the life of him.  Questions often had nothing to do with what we covered, or had no correct answers, etc.  But overall lecture was good.  The lab for this class (which is not run by him at all) really sucks though."
1640759,3.4,"Curtis, Scott",Jacobs,10,0.49191179002707186,Excellent argumentation/debate theory and practice. The focus of the class was formal debate practice which exercises research &amp; critical thinking skills. He is unafraid to tackle touchy issues regarding policy debate which provides an intellectually challenging class environment. He does have a generally intimidating personality.,"If you don't want to go to class, then you won't do well. He only assigns take home exam questions that, as long as you follow his guidelines, are not difficult. I enjoyed the material presented throughout the semester and I know other CMN students that took other Argumentation sections and Jacobs is way better! He's really helpful and a great prof",The best communication professor in UIUC.,Not the best teacher at all. He assigns lots of assignments for completion only though and gives all A's. The class was really fun and was actually pretty useful. He does drone on about random stuff but overall he can be eccentric which is a bit funny. There is work to be done but as long as you do it you guarantee an A. Not bad for a 300 class.,"The lectures were so boring it was almost impossible to stay engaged in the material. I'm pretty sure he was aware of this because he usually brought Monster for us to sip on halfway through class. It was cool, but it's bad if you know you're putting your own class to sleep.  Lectures were often hard to follow because he his points weren't clear.","There's 2 sections of CMN 496 do not take argumentation theory section. It was a horrible class. In lecture, Professor Jacobs just talked in circles. I stopped going. The take-home exams were confusing and there was a 6 (3 page) fallacy project due at the end of the semester. In total mine was about 16 pages. I do not recommend.","If you are looking for a class that will provide you with an easy grade but with little information, you should take a class with Professor Jacobs. The lectures are confusing, mainly because Jacobs doesn't understand how to construct a class so that it appeals to students. Two take-home exams all semester, various readings.",Easy grader but a very boring class. He is very strict about no use of technology in his classroom.,"We had two take home exams during the semester but he gives you more than 3 weeks to do them. As long as you follow the directions and skim the articles, you'll definitely get an A. No real homework!",Only 2 papers throughout entire semester.

If you are genuinely interested in the topic I highly recommend this class, otherwise it will be pretty painful","Professor Jacobsen gets a bad rep, and I think its unfair. He is very smart and very willing to work with students who are genuinely interested and trying. If you are a slacker/looking for an easy pass, move along. Jacobsen is hard, but a great professor in latin american history","honestly the worst class ive ever taken. unfair grading policies, super boring classes, never stops talking. keeps the class after the time that it's supposed to be let out. Super annoying to sit through his class, thinks he's the most intellectual bc he's writing a book. dont take this class.","If you go to lecture, read, and do your papers it is impossible to get below a B.   If you don't do one of those it is difficult to get above a C.  Throw in a little studying and this class is an easy A for the taking.","Is an interesting class. Yet, you do have to complement lecture with the assigned readings and discussion. Overall great class.","The thing I found most difficult was what was discussed in lecture, in discussion sections, and what we were supposed to read was all different! I did not learn anything in lecture. The tests were essay &amp; there would be 5 questions but there would be 15 on the study guide you had to prepare for. Only way I managed a B was I did well on papers.","Make sure you NEVER miss his class. I have to admit his pop quiz policy is very annoying, but it helps eventually. Listen to his lecture and write down what he SAYS that are IMPORTANT, not the powerpoint. (writing down the powerpoint is useless). This class is NOT hard as long as you know your materials and listen to him in class.",Boring lectures.  Easy essay based tests.  Make sure you know your terms.,"He was super boring, and easily sidetracked, but if you read, you get an A on the exams.  If you read and try you get an A on all the papers.  What more can you ask?",Class was so boring! I didn't read anything throughout the year and completely stopped going to lecture after two weeks. Ended up with a good grade due to the information I already knew.,"He seems like a nice guy, but his lectures are super boring.",No Comments,"This class is probably the worst class I have ever taken. The professor appears to this his is the only class we are taking and demands way too much reading and interest for the class.

There are easier more interesting classes available.","If you want really want to learn about Latin America, this professor is amazing. Go to his office hours and you'll have a real conversation.","This professor is horrible, he doesn't teach everythign but expects us to learn on our own and the class  is so unstructured and i hate it","His subject is beyond boring, and the way he goes about teaching it would be fine for a European history class but for those not familiar at all with the area is almost incomprehensible.  Also, he is about as liberal a teacher as you are likely to find, taking as many jabs as he could at free trade","The lack of clarity made it kind of difficult. Some of the reading was really bad, but most of it was fine. Essay tests and papers. Fair, pretty easy grading. Nice intro to the subject, but I felt we only skimmed the surface.","Lectures are wordy--so are provided outlines. He knows NOTHING about technology, but tries to use it anyway. if you're looking for a prof who knows his stuff, he's it, but at 9am he'll put you back to sleep every class period."

Not Willing to help.

Interesting project, but get ready to memorize slides to pass.",Really good course!,"You have to know what you're getting into, but if you accept it you'll do fine. Tests are usually based off of homework or lecture examples, but still are very hard. Always attend class. Always. ALWAYS. Even when it's optional (which it always is). You can get crazy extra credit for attending certain ones.","Extra credit doesn't necessarily mean good. He gave a pop quiz for extra credit, up to 12% added to your final grade if you do correctly or 6%deducted.3 ppl out of 80 turned the quiz in.  Instructed the TA's to not help us with the final project during office hours. In general, you have to learn everything on your own.","non-mandatory attendance is not really non-mandatory. he gave extra credit to people who attended after saying that the material will not be included in the final. really bad communicator, forms bitter relationships with students. if you do not do things his way, he will do his best to make the course a nightmare for you. not a very likable person.",Really didn't learn anything from class.  Made the last 2 weeks optional and then gave out over 10% extra credit to the overall final grade to the few students who showed up.  One of the worst teachers I've ever had.,"Horrible. Holds grudges and forms bitter relationship towards students due to low midterm class average. If we failed your midterm, it means we need more help and guidance professor, not punishment.","This professor is a child. He simply got really mad at how everyone did bad on the midterm and does not show up for class, so he just made up really childish punishments for people who dont show up. He penalized the people who didnt show up by giving out extra grades and letting people know about the index card in class. Needs to mature. Seriously.","So basically, this class is a required class for the FALL semester for IE students, during your senior year. So basically, if you do not pass this course, you are most likely to take this class the next year, unable to graduate on time. Also, the tests are seriously difficult, without given partial credits. If you have this professor, then pray.","I personally think that this is not a hard course like everyone else complaining about. If you show up to the class and start studying two days before the exam, then exam is very straight forward, slightly modified from lecture note problems.  All you need to do is show up to lectures and take notes on what he says it will be on the exam.","Toughest class I have taken! Confusing materials, unclear lectures and the exams are a nightmare! Material starts out being interesting but it becomes very difficult to grasp soon.","I think that IE310 as a prerequisite is not helpful at all. Professor explains as if everyone should know the stuff he teaches. Power point is the only thing he goes over, no other references. The book has no diagrams or whatsoever. The class doesn't teach you probability models. You just have to know all this before you take the class.",Great professor.  Funny guy.  Keeps topic interesting. enthusiastic

She knows what she is talking about and has a great deal of knowledge about films you watch. Overall interesting and easy class!","She's overall a great professor. Her instructions are typically easy to follow and the tests are all open notes, so going to class which is mandatory helps so you can take good notes. She also doesn't mind if you take pictures of the slides.  The essays were the only things that were difficult to do really well on.","She's really strict on attendance, but I think it's worth going to class because that way you can get notes from the lecture and you can use all your notes on the exams. She knows what's she's talking about and because of that, she grades hard since she knows her stuff and also because she's watched, like, all the films you'll probably write about","Diana is a great lecturer and always has intriguing notes. Her grading is very hard, but there are only two papers, a midterm, and a final, so not much time is spent on homework or studying. She docks grade if you miss more than 3 classes, so be sure to show up. Movies she chose were very good and she knew a lot of information about them.","While the midterm and final was open note, she's a super difficult grader and is completely unclear about what is required for the two assigned papers. On the first, she allows rewrites, but she makes things so much more difficult than necessary which is super annoying. More trouble than it's worth.","Only the final and 3 papers. She was a pretty hard grader, but the final is open note. Long lectures for the screenings, which were also late at night. Attendance was mandatory and taken every class period. She zooms through slides and doesn't post them online. Very nice, but the class was harder than it needed to be. She has an IMDB page!"

A typical critique comment would be ""that just, doesn't flow, you know what I mean?"" He is not very precise or anal about design--he just wants it to look good.

Fun projects with extreme freedom.,"Fun guy who suggests creative projects.

He helps improve you in any way possible.  He is the kind of person who would give their shirt off their back for you.  His insight into Hip Hop is useful with Graphic Deisgn Skills.

She cares about students so much and truly takes their feedback into account. Compared to her first semester teaching (Fall 2015), her second semester (Spring 2016) seemed to run smoother. Start lab reports early, ask questions, and you'll do fine. The labs are quite fun, especially the end of semester project.","She was very knowledgeable about the lab protocols, and learning important techniques in cell culturing is something I'll definitely take away from this class. However, she is not very effective in communicating with her students about her expectations on the lab reports. She is a very stringent grader and did not provide meaningful feedback.","Professor Jensen is new and has restructured the class. She is credible; she has performed all of the protocols in industry before and knows the material. However, sometimes there is an issue with clear communication. She knows so much that she doesn't know how to address students' questions and confuses people even more."

Some of the material was dull, but it was better than most of my other gen-eds.","Great class, great professor.",Tough class,Really enjoying the class so far.,"Very interesting class if you're into music - goes from gregorian chants to swing and hip-hop. Class is just one big power point (which he puts up before exams) and listening to music. You have to memorize all the music lecture notes to get a good grade.

I guess the subject isn't super interesting but the presentation of slides was soporific to say the least. Don't take it if you don't have to.","Kisha is nice and helpful, but she could teach with a little more enthusiasm.  Class is pretty dry. Most students attended class only for the pop quizzes. The tests are semi-difficult, but she gives out a lot of extra credit! And she grades assignments leniently. So if you actually go to class and semi-pay attention, you should do well.","Worse class I've ever taken at U of I, and I love the subject! Every class was a lecture read off BW powerpoint slides. Not really any homework, but midterm and final account for a lot of your grade. They're not easy. Uninspiring. Would not recommend to anyone.","You need to go to class. It is necessary for ""POP QUIZZES."" Pretty crucial to your grades. The course contains very dry and boring information. Try not to fall asleep or stray away.

I didn't dread going to this class or studying for the exams.,"Very interesting class; class is mandatory but worth it. May not be the easiest A, but as long as u study the slides u should be good. Book isn't necessary; don't get much homework either. Maybe 2 or 3 assignments. Learned a lot. And make sure u study chapter 2 the most; it's the hardest chapter but everything else is easy. Not cumulative.","I love this class! It's very interesting, and the material always catches my attention. The 1st test is the hardest by far, but after that they get much easier. Ashleigh is a good teacher, and I like the fact that we watch lots of videos in order for us to understand the lessons much easier. She offers a lot of bonus points btw. Take the class!"

He thinks fast in class and gives answer even before u understand what the problem is. Digesting the notes after class is a must (but the class will get easier once u'r following him). He is very lenient in grading and prepares fair questions for midterms. Only one thing: what he writes on blackboard is very hard to read.,His voice has the power to make one extremely uncomfortable and his explanation is just terrible.

Your best option is to read the book, and do go to the lectures and office hours right before exams, he will pretty much tell you what is to be in the test. Very smart guy, though!","Terrible lecturer, most likely the worst professor you'll encounter in your college endeavors. Didn't take anything away from his lectures, so you're better off just skipping it and using that time to read the textbook (which has bad explanations also). Hilarious, as in hilariously awful. Very well respected researcher though, and generous grader.",He is quite warm-hearted but often he cannot explain things clearly in lectures.,"Comically awful. His lectures are super duper confusing. His homeworks are super duper confusing. His tests are super duper confusing. On the bright side, though, his exam grading was shockingly generous. I put the dumbest, made up garbage for some of my answers and would still get half the points!","His course lacks any sense of structure. He likes to jump around and scribble on the board. He supplies pictures of his notes online, but it doesn't help much. He is pretty helpful and does care for the course, but sometimes it can be frustrating how unorganized it seems. Tests and homework are very fair. Generous grader as well.",I took the Mathematica version of MATH 461 because I heard it was fairly easy. It wasn't.

There were no office hours for ages either.,"So friendly and contagiously happy. Complete genius, knows what he's talking about, but talks on levels too complex for his undergrad classes. Always willing to help. Messy board work but slow enough to follow. I really enjoyed the class. Extremely lenient grader you will get an A although you may not learn much. I suggest reading the text to learn","He loves the historical side of mathematics, and is extremely knowledgeable! He is a very fair grader on homework and exams which means you can get a decent grade. Unfortunately his speech and board work is cluttered, disorganized, and hard to follow. Also, he mixes up English and German a lot. He is a nice guy and wants to help.","Genius, but not a perfect teacher. Hard to understand, but fair, helpful and fun.",Very bad professor. Not very helpful with information and goes on random useless talks about proofs and people that are irrelevant to the class but are obviously his hobbies.

Her only faults were that she rambled and sometime didn't finish her thoughts. I scored highest on her test out of the four, but I don't think that's typical.","She was okay but tended to ramble a bit. I had to record her lectures so that I didn't miss anything. The content of her section was interesting but I had some trouble keeping up with her. Overall not too bad, but could be better.","I had her for 210 and as a course coordinator in 311.

You have to pay attention but overall I found her a funny but good professor.","She is boring. You have to go to lecture because she does not use power point. She thinks she's really funny and smart.

He really aspired to be the best instructor he could be and tried his best to make a difficult topic easier for the students. Would take any class that he is teaching, without a doubt",I thoroughly believe that  Professor Kairouz did the best he can to teach ECE 313 however this class was still hard for me as it was the first time I've ever seen stats/probability. He is always ready to help and I believe he's the best professor for this course.

Participation is not required but the content is so difficult that it's likely you won't pass if you don't go to the lectures.","Kalbarczyk is a really solid choice for ECE 391. I took the class with him and then worked as a TA for the course. His lectures were very thorough and taught the material well. This course is infamously difficult, but I think Kalbarczyk helped make it more accessible for me. I would definitely take the class with him if you can.","He teaches the most important class at UIUC for CompE majors and he does a very poor job. His lectures are very boring, he rambles on about irrelevant things, does not answer students questions well and get ready to understand everything from the lecture notes.",You will learn nothing at his class. Most materials are very outdated and useless. The grading policy is very unclear. Avoid this professor if you can!,I never went to class and I got an A...He teaches very slowly and didnt cover a lot of important materials. You have to read the lecture notes by yourself anyways.

This guy is leading some hot researches and completely doesn't care about this class. If you are not a computer genius that can teach yourself well, DO NOT take his classes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",His accent and style of teaching makes the class boring. not comprehensive and is very annoying when he keeps on changing the dates that students turn in their homework every week! And he also post quizzes online unexpectedly to beat anyone who does not check online stuff often.,Just so disappointed. Lack of teaching quality. Had almost no proper knowledge of topic at hand despite being a professor. Very poor communication skills. I loved the class topics but just hated the teacher's inability to teach/help/clarify. The two ratings below me are quite accurate.,Fails at life. Most inconsistent and unintelligent professor I've ever had. Never prepared. Never on time. Slides are definitely taken from another teacher. Avoid him at all costs like everyone else said.,"He is not the sort of teacher I hoped he would be at ALL. As many have already said, he's incomprehensible, extremely unprepared, does not even remotely know the material well enough to answer a single question, and his voice can kill - not in the good way. Avoid him at all costs because you're gonna regret ever taking any of his classes.","Classes are not comprehensible. His slides are useless.

He does tend to ramble about the topic, but I guess it helps you learn it better.  His accent isn't really a problem, so don't worry about that.","In addition to teaching 231, he's my advisor and I can never understand what he's saying.  I learned the class off of the lecture slides.",Pretty good,"Professor Kale taught with Porfessor Harrison for CS 231. Professor Kale presents the material clearly and explains what you need to know well. He has a slight accent, but after a while I got used to it.

He wrote the book that he lectures on so you can choose to read or attend lecture and still do well.",Amazing Professor who really loves what he is teaching. Does his best to make class fun and interesting and educational. You'll learn more from this class than most because you don't have to worry about your grade. Easy A. Definitely recommend.,"Probably greatest prof I had in 3 years so far (FIN major perspective). He's hilarious, and his lectures are pretty informative. Exams are average difficulty, and doesn't cover everything in lecture. some concepts confusing, but still an excellent professor. take his class before he retires. VERY VERY knowledgable. Extremely interesting class.","Kaler is a very loveable person, he genuinely loves the subject and loves to teach his students. His book is extremely unorganized but you can pass his class without reading or even going to all the lectures. He makes his class very easy and tests are completely based on the weekly homework questions.","Professor Kaler was one of the most inspiring teachers I've ever had.  He made the subject interseting, just due to his amaizing excitement about the topic.  It's a shame that more teachers can't enjoy their work the way he does.  It makes all the difference in the students performance.  Anybody would be lucky to have Professor Kaler.","(CHP Section) One of the smartest individuals I have ever met.  This can cause problems when he tries to explain things and they go way over people's heads, but they make perfect sense to him, but he's generally pretty good at explaining things.

Trust me, do not choose this professor not only because he has a terrible accent.","Professor Kalipeni was an OK teacher. He is from Malawi, which has its pros and cons. He knows a lot about developing countries and is clearly pretty intelligent. But the downside is that he has a thick accent and reads straight off the powerpoints during lectures, making them feel long and sometimes boring. It was tougher than i thought it'd be.","Very funny and likeable guy. Interesting life stories. Does not follow syllabus. Quizzes are open book, but he uses old test banks so material does not always correspond with his lectures. His response to any of your problems is ""don't worry, it will be okay"" (dismissive).  All lecture slides are posted. Makes me laugh every class. Jolly guy.","Professor Kalipeni taught a class at my university this past fall and then left to go back to UIUC.  He is unintentionally funny and though he is tougher to understand (being from Malawi), its always fun to be in his class. I definitely recommend taking a class of his.  If he were still at my school, I'd be taking one with him this semester.",He is very hard to understand and his lectures are very dry. He is fun however and that makes up for how terrible his daily quizzes and tests are. Way too much work for an intro/ gen. ed. class and too many projects requiring you to use labs and resources generally not needed in such a low level class.,"I enjoyed the content of this class and the professor is very funny, but I feel I zoned out a lot in his lectures and learnt the most by independent study for quizzes and assignments, if attendance wasn't mandatory I wouldn't have needed to attend. This class has a lot of busy work that can be a little overwhelming","Professor Kalipeni is a friendly person with a great sense of humor. His stories will definitely make you laugh. The class isn't too hard if you go over his discussion quizzes and slides, but Kalipeni can be very disorganized. He hardly ever follows the syllabus. Class is mandatory and can be boring, but his sense of humor is surely one of a kind.","He tries to be funny, but comes off as incomprehensible, and often makes references to his own personal unfounded beliefs. Avoid him at all costs.","Interesting class, really understands it because he is from Africa. Questions from discussion quizzes are on the midterm and finals. Show up to class and you'll do fine!  He's pretty goofy, sometimes hard to understand (accent) and overall good guy, but doesn't stick to the syllabus at all",I am taking Geog 384 this semester. He seems like a very fair professor. The subject matter is very intersting. His accent is a little bit hard to understand though. I took his class in Spring 2009.,"Horrible class, very hard for a gen ed.

Burton is not a good TA. Weird and awkwardly unapproachable...sections got awkward very quickly.","Funny prof, but I usually don't pay attention.  Lecture slides are online.  More assignments than I would have thought.  Seems like something is due every week in discussion.  for discussion do not take burton!!!  alejandro is good.  overall, easy class.",This professor does not care about teaching or is just a really terrible teacher.

I missed half a test and still got a B+ in it.  memorizing developing countries were kinda boring but, still an easy grade.",Impossible to cover study materials for final. Memorization required for about 140 countries.,"Eh, okay class. If you need a Gen-Ed though its prolly your best bet.  He makes lectures funny at times, but they're not too mandatory.  Study for tests and/or pay attention in class lots.  Lecture notes online are key.",This class sucks. The tests are ridiculous..but that is more the TAs' fault than Kalipeni's. He's really hard to understand. I took this thinking it would be my blow off class and it is one of my hardest...Take something else if you can.,HORRIBLE CLASS!! I thought this would be easy but the test was impossible! He asks you the most irrelevant things from notes and then the most obscure stuff from the books you have to read. You NEED to go to class because he'll randomly take attendance and that counts for 6% of your grade.

Does a great job of relating material to real world experience.,"This was the most boring class I have ever taken in college, and while at first Dr. Kalita's high energy and positive attitude made the class better...

It can be annoying sometimes when most of the class gets the topic but i appreciate that he cares about the whole class. The grading on hw can get tough depending on your TA.,The two courses that I took with Jeff Kansler were vitally important as a beginning understanding of building structures which were then built on in the following year with more difficult information.  He taught fully the concepts which were needed and made success not only possible in his class but in the following ones as well.,He is a very good teacher.

I would love to have him again as a professor.,"Test are not impossible but extremely difficult and the grading is draconian, every available point you could loose on a problem they make sure you do.

He posts lecture notes before class, so it is best for one to read them before lecture.  His office hours are helpful as well.

You will easily spend more than 3 hours on each hw, which is probably why that other person got Ds on them.","great teacher. he provides extensive examples. he is fluent in english enough that the other reviewer sounds like he has a grudge. he will always help you out if you go to office hours and if you have an honest dispute about a grade, he is more than likely to rule in your favor and throw at least a couple points your way.","Incredibly difficult to understand.  Between his not-very-firm grasp on English, large amount of ""ums"", and the fact that he messes up on about half the examples he does, this class is WAY more difficult than it should be.

He explains things pretty well, although sometimes they are not 100% clear. Overall, a good professor. A fair grader as well.","Likes teaching the language, but also likes to go at his own pace; which can both fast and slow at the same time. Willing to field questions, but often doesn't like to explain things he considers 'unnecessary'. Most of the time, though, he will end up telling a story to explain why he doesn't want to explain, and then explain anyway. Good professor"

Truly versatile as an educator- an open mind that is able to cater pedagogy to all different learning styles. Expectations are high, but that is because he is dedicated to leading you toward any goal in your playing that you want to meet.","I just love Dr. Keeble. He cares for his students as artists and as people. Hell take you to the next level and beyond. And beyond that, too.","A simply amazing flutist and teacher. If you want to move to the next level, Dr. Keeble is the one.","He is fantastic! Although his emphasis is more on Performance Majors, he really does care for everyone in his studio. If you want to improve as a musician, performance or education, I highly recommend him. (Music Education Major)",Lovely professor!  Will teach you what you need to know and is a genuinely great person.,"He's awesome, and good looking too!","Doing grad work here at UIUC. Dr. Keeble is a wonderful professor, performer, and teacher. He will push you to the next level, and the next, and the next... Selects students with potential and transforms them into polished musicians. (txtbook use irrelevant; you will order lots of music though!)",He is the bestest of all flute teachers!,"If you're serious about flute performance, this is your guy!!!!!!!!!!","Wonderful!

235217,3.2,James,Keene,6,0.6584508026583787,"Keene has an abhorrent personality which lies in wait to be unleashed upon his students - similar to that of a smiling crocodile. Even among accomplished graduate and doctoral students, his misguided arrogance and narcissism always led him to believe he was the best musician in the room. He is/was detested by many of his colleagues nationwide.","What you guys are forgetting is that Mr. Keene comes from a different (older) band tradition. He is a direct descendent of Revelli- who was known for being ruthless in his pursuit of perfection. However, I know of few band directors in the world that can get a sound out of a band like Mr. Keene. Nicest BD ever-no,but musically one of the best ever!","Not a very nice or understanding guy.  You basically have to do things his way or you fail, which is interesting considering if HE were taking his classes, (i.e. conducting), he'd be ripped apart!","A BEGIAN he is NOT. Not in the Revelli, Begian or Payne league regardless of the hype job being done by the School of Music.","Mr. Keen is a musical genious.  He is exceptionally clear when he gives instructions, but, not a very nice guy on the podium.  I would call him very unhelpful, but very clear... if that makes any sense.","Mr. Keene is Mr. Keene, what can you say?  I like Mr. Keene, but he does have a reputation for being mean and he sometimes makes ""colorful"" jokes in band.  He is an excellent musician and conductor."
2116847,2.5,David,Kell,10,0.35044123426111795,"The course was definitely a toughie. However, unlike the past reviews I must clarify that the online version of orgo has been revamped. I love the textbook! I think that so long as you put in the work, the exams are very doable (there's extra points built in/curve) &amp; both the prof &amp; TA are accessible. I never attended discussions &amp; still did fine.","Though I did not attend very many of his later lectures for the lab, it was overall straightforward and the exam at the end was a breeze. It had built in additional points and was similar to the study guide. So long as you attend the lectures in the beginning to get a good foundation (esp with dry labs) &amp; watch the webcasts, you're good.","Class wasn't particularly hard as much as it was time-consuming. One mid-term at the very end of the semester, no final. Seemed like no matter how perfect my lab reports were, I was always marked off on trivial errors, like forgetting to put the degree symbol. Do me a favor and please don't go to Kell's optional lectures. They're dry and worthless.","He is unapproachable and speaks to like you are below him. Watch the online lectures and you will be fine, you do not need to go to lecture. He was the head instructor for my lab, but it was my TA who graded everything. Get a good/great TA and you will be better off. I know a lot of people didn't go to class just to avoid kell...","Ashamed to say that he is a professor at our campus. Exams are poorly written: vague, stupid questions testing petty concepts. Does not care about our learning, cares more about high averages to look good--that's good for us because that means huge curves and lots of random bonuses.  He shouldn't teach. He's lazy, and hard to take seriously.","Took the class over the summer online. Best professor I've had at UIUC thus far! I have no idea why he has such poor ratings on here. Maybe it's because I took it online. The ""discussions"" (lectures) were very beneficial.  Study hard, ask him questions during office hours and discussion and you'll get a good grade!","While CHEM 232 is poorly structured at this university, Kell does not help the situation. On the occasions I e-mailed him he was rude and unprofessional. He claims he is busy, yet does no research, does not teach other classes, and has few office hours. Take advantage of SI sessions to pass. Exams are fair because he pulls questions from Mastering.",He was absolutely terrible. The class is taught using 6 year old videos made by a professor who is no longer in the Chemistry department. He literally doesn't teach anything. He is also very rude during his office hours. He makes the smartest kids feel dumb.,"Kell can't teach. Maybe that's why orgo is offered only online. He rambles and doesn't address the question and I learned more from the TA's, who aren't great. They teach the majority of the class. Lectures are old youtube videos, which don't always cover the homework. This class is a mess. I still learned a lot, but the class isn't GPA-friendly.","It's not because the class is online, he's just a bad professor for a hard topic.  For a course that is online, a lot of students are coming in for personal help. He spends more time talking than explaining and it's infuriating. He's not good at writing exams as they often have mistakes in them and just don't test you in the right way."
492563,4.0,Neil,Kelleher,3,0.3900327656345411,"While he focused too much on non-chemistry stuff (mainly proteins and genetics which have no place in a chemistry course), he was very clear, energetic, and made lectures tolerable.  If you like your chem with a dash (or a few truckloads) of bio, he's the guy!","Material wasn't very interesting. The class was very superficial. I don't think I learned much, but Prof. Kelleher was very energetic and interested in the material.","Always made class fun, really tried to connect the material to examples in the real world."
843543,4.3,Marcus,Keller,3,0.5412527986920842,"Interesting at times. Because the class is so discussion-oriented it is crucial to read over all texts prior to class. Homework assignments, however are rarely quick. Be prepared to sometimes dedicate an hour to one text. He does a good job of conceptualizing.","Do the readings before class - Keller explains well, but it helps to situate oneself. Daily homework, small writing assignments, 1-2 longer papers, in-class participation. Sometimes he uses PPT, movie clips, articles, etc to support learning. Emphasis on connections between people/events/perspectives, rather than facts/dates.","Pretty good class overall, pretty interesting lectures, hardly any graded assignments so do a good job on the ones there are - just 2 papers a midterm and a final. Other than that its just participation and daily homework on readings"

This section was all about Drugs, Crime, and Alcohol, and I'll admit that I learned SO MUCH about how messed up our drug policies are here, and I was taught to think critically about why/how these policies are the way they are and how to change them.","I was extremely disappointed taking this class. The material was extremely interesting but the administration of it was absolutely terrible. There is an insane amount of work, and the TA grades WAY too harshly. Something that clearly deserves 100 will get an 80. Not even close to enough time to complete tests. Do not take this class.","She is very nice, easy to approach, and down to Earth. There was much reading required for the class, but the topics were usually very interesting.",

There was no curve in the class, which is ok, but the grades must have been very average to poor. Many of us were 3 pts or less from a higher grade, and she stopped responding to emails when brought up. Nice and wants you to learn at least."
