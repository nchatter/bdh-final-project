Although lecture can be boring at times, all the things she has you fill in are important; most likely the information will show up on the exams. Her review sessions are really helpful. Overall, fantastic class. You learn a lot."

Exams are open notes.,"Excellent professor, he really loves to teach and if you want to learn physics of light this is your guy. He is there to help, honestly one of the best physics prof.  His lectures are entertaining","Good lecturer. Topics covered in class got complicated second half of semester but hw and tests were very reasonable. Not very helpful and can be dismissive when it comes to regrades due to bookTA error, but caves with enough persistence. Great online lecture notes. Definitely more theoretical than practical, lots of wave eqns and no lasers.","Tests are tough, homework takes time but isn't too difficult.  Lecture slides are helpful.",Not too bad. Notes are nice. Attending lectures are a must.,"GREAT teacher! very knowledgeable. makes lectures interesting and makes physics easier to understand by using it in ""real life""","Prof seems really fun in class but is a little cold in person. Lectures are interesting but not super helpful for exams. You have to learn mostly on your own &amp; in discussion. Despite doing poorly on 2 exams, studying all the discussion notes &amp; worksheets got me an A on the final and overall. The textbook is pretty dense &amp; didn't help me personally","pretty good professor, writes very easy exams to make up for concepts he doesnt explain too well","Coming to lecture was pretty useless. I learned most of the physics concepts on my own and discussion sections. I didn't do so hot on the exams...but somehow pulled off an A- in the class. Decent professor, I guess.","The exams were not bad if you studied the past ones and knew how to do the problems. Abbomonte was a real jerk if you wanted some help after class. I came up to him to ask him a question that would have taken him 3 seconds to answer, and he told me to go to office hours. When I emailed him and told him I couldn't come, he said ""Too Bad.""  ...","Seems nice in class, but when you actually approach him he can be kind of a jerk. And that's without asking dumb questions. He makes his exams harder than previous ones, and I would actually recommend reading the textbook because it's a myth that it doesn't help, people say that because they don't read it. Good book, average professor.",Awesome teacher... fairly easy test esp if you really study the  past exams. He tries really hard to be entertaining in class and he's usually successful. Book is pointless.,"He's a cool and funny guy, but going to class is not really useful if you can get everything online."
781808,4.6,Ali,Abbas,25,0.6578744407913325,This is perhaps one of the best classes I have taken and professor Abbas is by far one of the best instructors. He has an amazing way of making things simple and has deep knowledge of the subject. I am honored to have taken DA with him as he wrote the classic text. I enjoyed Ahoona the social network and still use it in my decisions to this point.,A very respected professor who really cares about his students and the material. I think everyone should take his class.,"Really a funny guy, makes lectures so fun and engaging and interesting. You learn a lot of cool useful stuff and have a blast doing it. Toughest part of the course though is that none of the lecture slidesnotes go online, and the textbook (which he wrote himself) is meh, so I had to rely really heavily on my own notes. Ahoona is the worst.",I heard a lot about this class before taking it and was looking forward to the experience. Professor Abbas certainly exceeded my expectations. Great course.,Best class I have ever taken.  Best prof I have ever had.  Need I say more?,"Great teaching style and learning experience. However, he is not very accessible outside class and does not respond to emails. Zero feedback provided in assignments (they were sometimes not even graded)",A great professor with an amazing teaching style. I wish more professors were like him.,"Professor Abbas is by far the best professors I have had. He is approachable, extremely knowledgeable, and has an amazing ability of presenting material in a fun and interesting way. I am honored tohave taken Decision Analysis with him and I recommend this class to any one at the U of I, not just engineering students.","Professor has students read ""The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People"" for class. There is only one habit of highly  successful people, and that is that they don't waste their time reading self-help nonsense. If you want to read something to better yourself, read educational information.",Great and fun class.,"This guy has changed the way I look at decisions I make. He is intelligent, fun, and makes hilarious witty comments. The case studies were very helpful.",I am a grad student in nuclear engineering. I took GE 450 and GE 550 with Professor Abbas. Both were very helpful for my thesis work. This has been one of the best classes I have taken at the U of I.,"Good lecturer. The materials are kind of common sense but they do change the way of my thinking. Nice and fun experience, but not so helpful for grad students.",great proff!,Excellent professor and extremely helpful. Also very clear presentation. Material is very very useful. I took GE 331 with him and it was great too. Definitely take Decision Analysis before you leave.,"Awesome....yes, I do have a crush on him","A really great professor who is also very very helpful. I loved the experience, and wish we had more professors like him.","AWESOME CLASS! It has changed the way I think about decisons forever. With Dr. Abbas I feel that I am in the presence of a true genius who has an amazingly simple way of teaching probability. He has helped me apply myself in new ways, especially in creative thinking. I will use his material for my senior design project and my summer internship .",He is a great teacher. I kind of have a crush on him just because of his knowledge about decision analysis.,Good lecturer. He focuses more in learning rather than examinations/grading. He usually goes off topics and calls off classes.
396520,5.0,Ann,Abbott,9,0.6938066186611113,Profesora Abbott is the best Spanish teacher I have ever had! She genuinely cares about her students. One of our activities was learning how to put the different concepts we learned in class like bilingual marketing on our resume! I think this speaks volumes about the goals she has for her students,"Ann is such an amazing teacher. I really recommend taking her class, they are very practical. She genuinely cares about her students and the community. By far, best spanish class/professor I have ever had - maybe even best class I've taken at the university.","One of the BEST Spanish teachers who taught one of the best classes I've ever had in Spanish. TAKE SPAN 202. It's VERY practical. You get to practice speaking with all the other students. She makes the class really comfortable. Show up to class for the participation, and there are a 9 assignments but they are pretty easy and practical. No exams :)","This was a pretty easy class but at the same time it was pretty cool because you have to do some community work. Class only once a week, and there is a take home midterm and take home final. The professor is a very nice lady too.",She is amazingly nice and very understanding.,"Very intelligent woman.  She appreciates your efforts to improve and will bump your grade up for it.  Great person to do your letters of rec for grad school, etc.",No Comments,Wonderful woman and professor. Class is enjoyable and I have learned more than in all of my other Spanish classes.,"Incredibly nice, cultured woman.  The texts aren't the most exciting in the world, but if you must take a literature class, take it with Ann."

I loved everything about his teaching and knowledge!"
797719,3.6,Tarek,Abdelzaher,7,0.46861810278241556,He keeps going over whatever he wants. He is great but I think he must dedicate some time to teach seriously,"The exams are pretty much unrelated to the programming assignments, so if you do well on the programming assignments, that doesn't mean that you're prepared for the exams. For no good reason at all, 10% of the grade is for participation, which is objectionable in any serious class.",Hard to understand. He doesn't care about his students.,great ones,Same as the reviewer below: He really tries to make you understand the material instead of rush through it.  Learned a lot from his class...,"Very good lectures. Actually tries to make you understand, instead of flying through material. Very easy to talk to and listens to his students.",Good teacher leard a lot.
2291129,5.0,Wafa,Abdulla,1,0.5645888199604199,I love prof Wafa! She is super passionate about the subject and cares a lot about the students.

960923,4.8,Nancy,Abelmann,2,0.7624296184209688,"Professor Abelmann is by far my favorite professor and the best I've had in all four years. She has so much energy and obviously cares about her students. She really tries to make it interesting even for non-majors in the class. It's not necessarily an easy class but she picks great readings, which made it worthwhile. Very knowledgeable &amp; helpful.","She is one of the best professors I've ever met. I enjoy her class, and appreciate her enthusiasm. I read every assigned readings - they are SO enjoyable. She is so passionate and sets a great example for students. Her knowledge on Korea/Korean Americans is truly impressive. She is so engaging. I look forward to taking her classes in the future."
929184,5.0,John,Abelson,1,0.3153570514729874,"Course material can be interesting, but boring when explained in detail. For example, finding out why an oil rig would spontaneously crash into the ocean is interesting, but learning learning all the details to metal failures gets tedious.

1959547,5.0,Bryan,Abendschein,6,0.5676484085477295,"My favorite professor. I would take any class he teaches. If you attend class, it is easy to remember his lectures because he makes it so interesting. He is very understanding and approachable if you ever need to talk to him. The material is graded fairly. 3 Exams, group project, presentation, 2 short papers, and a paper broken up into milestones.","Incredible instructor. Bryan's lecture slides are clear and useful, and as long as you take good notes, filling out the study guides will be a breeze. Welcoming classroom environment with one tiny group project, which made making class friends easy(helpful if you miss). Three exams, and one big term paper with many milestones to keep you on track.","Bryan is one of my favorite professors at UIUC. He truly cares about students and wants to help. The tests in this class are sometimes tricky, but otherwise papers are very fairly graded. The lecture material was interesting and he used limited info. on the slides which made it easier to pay attention. Great guy!",He is so understanding and knowledgeable about communication. He is my favorite professor yet!,"If you're looking for easy A, I don't recommend this class.",Bryan is the best. He is so understanding and friendly. You can come to him with a problem and he will work through it with you. I always found myself really engaged in his lectures. He is so hilarious and energetic. He gives really constructive feedback and you can tell that he's really into the class. Wish I could take this class again.
845095,4.2,Daniel,Abosso,22,0.5768115667130858,Awesome TA. Currently enrolled in his section for ASST 104. He's HILARIOUS and pretty laid back. He seems strict but he really isn't. So hot too.,"The guy is funny and easily approachable, but his discussion section is useless for exams and is a truckload of busy work that would take up nearly all your free time. Do yourself a favor and enroll in a different section.","Extremely funny in a sarcastic and jaded kind of way, plus highly intelligent in the subject matter and passionate about it. However he managed to always keep the class in check. He is very understanding in terms of assignments, but don't get lazy - stay off the bad side.",He is very helpful and makes the class more fun.,"He teaches the course material really well. He makes everything seem difficult but when you see the final grade you would be pleasantly surprised. I'm surprised no one gave him a hot pepper! He reminds me of a stone age caveman but his descent wardrobe, sarcastic humor, nonchalant attitude, and bluntness makes up for everything.","Great class! He really pushes his students to improve their Latin, but he makes it interesting! Challenging and rewarding.","Great TA. He seems super strict at first but he's actually really nice, chill and funny. Don't get on his bad side. Easy class and his class is easy and fun!","He is an extremely intelligent person.  He knows his material and spends a lot of time outside class preparing. Absolutely do not ever come to class even the least bit unprepared. He will make you regret it. I learned a lot from him, but he scared the crap out of me.","He came off very intimidating, but as long as you do your work and make an honest effort, it should pay off. He can get very frustrated when you don't understand something, so be extra prepared. Don't take the class if you aren't ready or don't feel you can commit to it.","Good TA, very passionate. Don't get on his bad side. Otherwise very very easy and he has a nice beard (but he shaved it off)","i thought my discussion for greek myth would suck because of him but i was wrong. although he may sound a little harsh in the beginning, you may find him hilarious in a way. he does care about your writing skills but don't worry too much about that.","Dan is an excellent teacher. If you don't do what he says, it will be a long, difficult, and painful semester. He's kind of a curmudgeon, but he really cares about his students that are in his classes for more than a grade. He's even been helpful with projects I have had outside of his classes.","He's very passionate about what he teaches. He's hilarious in a weird way, but cool. Know how to write a paper. He hates it when people turn papers in unorganized and with grammar mistakes. Overall, he's a pretty decent teacher. He knows his stuff. Do the work and you'll be fine.",Good knowledge of the material and is straightforward with expectations,"i had him for Latin 101 in the fall of 2006. he assigned ""everything"" from each chapter in the book, which meant that there was a lot of work to do, but all this work paid off, especially when he had us doing real, unadapted latin. i'm in latin 102 now and i'm much more prepared than the students from other ta's. highly recommended!",Awesome,"Funny as hell. Sarcastic, yes; bitter and jaded are great words to describe this dude. Insulting? Don't say completely stupid things and you won't be ribbed too hard. Good hair; wardrobe more consistent than Calvin from C&amp;H. Class is fun and interesting, work not bad if you do what you're supposed to. His substitute is hot.","Very good TA who has a real enthusiasm for what he teaches. His lectures are generally very good and he connects ancient stuff to modern times. Funny, too.","He makes promises to his students that he does not bother to keep (e.g. ""mega quiz week"").  He wears awesome band shirts. He is bitter AND jaded. and has no qualms subtly pointing out that certain students in the class are incompetent. He also attempts to force intelligent students into working in study groups with idiots. No tea and cookies ever!!","He was a fun TA. Very sarcastic, but that's what made things interesting.

I would recommend taking a class with him. Tests were straightforward and homework was super easy.
1592032,3.3,Daniel,Abrams,4,0.47036194188561614,"Prof. A. is a master of structural engineering, especially concrete and masonry.  He will make fun of people in class, but it is always for a good reason and requires you to have thick skin. He will make you work hard, his tests are challenging, but he is very organized, thorough, and you will learn a lot. Highly recommended.","Dr. Abrams masonry course is unique, there are very few like it in the US. It's not all about bricks; this course is really a wall, ductility, and structural mechanics course that can easily be applied to R.C. Compared to the other structural graduate courses/teachers, Abrams was more professional, more practical, and did not crush us with work.",Abrams is an ass. End of comment,"This man was boring and his examples were worthless, barely any partial credit on the exams pratice exam was nothing like the actual exam, had to curve the exam 10% to get enough A's and still had 20% of teh people fail and 15% get D's meaning 35% failed before the curve, though heard he was better for 465 than 461 so who knows"
1789161,2.5,Katie,Abrams,2,0.5273873486528837,This was by far the worst professor and experience in class I have ever had. She never has anything organized. Gives us more work to do on a huge project which she doesnt explain well and confuses students because they are not trained for everything she wants. Avoid this person at all costs. I questioned UIUC's ability to choose quality professors.,"Dr. A is not an easy professor, and this is not an easy class. The course work is difficult and time consuming, but SO worth it. She challenges her students with real world assignments and shows you what life will be like in an advertising/communications career.

1426706,2.2,Aide,Acosta,12,0.3856793491477934,"I can't believe this woman attained a doctorate. She is unprofessional in every sense of the word. She knows nothing of the subject she teaches and cannot even speak correct English. Very unprofessional, very boring, and extremely irritating. The class is beyond easy, but honestly, I don't even know if it was worth it.","Despite what the previous comments say, I thought this class was quite enjoyable.  If you really read the readings and take advantage of the resources Aide provides, an A is easy to get.  The reason a TA walked around shushing people is because it was needed =p Tests are easy (for example, you can argue your case on a T/F question!)","Never before have I had such an unprofessional teacher. She can't speak well, nor spell. She treated everyone like we were little kids; even employing the TA's to walk around and police us during lecture. I'm certain she knows nothing about her subjects that she teaches. AVOID HER LIKE THE PLAGUE. I came to class everyday to laugh. ""What else?""","An awful professor in every sense of the word. She treated our 200+ person lecture as a 10 person discussion. She only reads passages from the book to teach the class, she actually doesn't know anything. And if you listen carefully every 3 minutes you will hear her say ""what else?"" Which by the way are the only original words she is can say. AWFUL.","A lot of reading extremely boring material, but quizzes aren't too bad. Personally, I find her to be very condescending.  She treats her students like children. It's just immature and rude.  I'm not a fan of her personality or the class really.","There were a lot of readings but she mostly gave away hints as to what you could expect on the quizzes in the class. As long as you go to class you will be able to do well on the quizzes. As for the tests, All the questions on the exams where from the quizzes just memorize the quiz questions and you should do well.","The class required lots of reading. I am a junior and took the class to fulfill two of my gen eds. She was hard to understand, uninteresting and wordy. By far, one of the worst teachers I have ever had. If you have time to do all the required readings and do lots of studying you may have better success.","She's an OK lecturer, but for the most part the lectures weren't very interesting. There's a TON of reading, but as long as you do it and have pretty good memory, you should do fine on the exams and quizzes. It wasn't terribly hard to get an A in the class, but you have to be careful and study well.","Needs to have more extra credit. Getting an 85 on one of the midterms pretty much guarantees you won't get an A in class, since the minimum is 94% (and good luck getting 100 on a final or a midterm, since there will always be at least a couple poorly worded ambiguous questions). Other than that, she's a pretty good teacher, definitely not a 1.0!","By far the worst teacher I have ever had. Her English (grammar, spelling, and word choice) is utterly nonsensical, even in quiz questions. You do not get to see your graded quizzes and she takes convincing to even give you the grades. She doesn't allow laptops in class unless you sit in the front row. She is immature, stupid, and unpleasant. AVOID.","She don't know how to teach,when students ask her questions. she won't answers anyway. Her quizzes was hard. Not as easy as i though. She really need to give us extra credit. I don't think she do it fair with the grade. For the whole. She was S*Ck. don't take her class.",Extremely unprofessional because she cannot spell correctly or say words correctly.  She also treats it like a high school class and is offended easily.  The class itself is somewhat interesting and manageable and worth taking with her even if just for a laugh.

She is energetic, funny, and a total chemistry dork, which endears her to the students. Make sure to devote ample time to study if you take the class, but it shouldn't be your most difficult freshman course.","Gretchen is by far the best professor. her chem lectures are super fun and she's always full  of energy and willing to answer any questions during lecture or clarify anything. if you go to office hours, shell help with any homework or lab write ups. you don't really need the textbook but if you need a deeper understanding i suggest to use it",Great professor. She seriously made things that confused the hell out of me make sense.,"This is by far the best class I have taken my whole college career.

He consistently reminds students to ask questions in lecture, and provides thorough responses. It seems as though he really cares about his students learning the material, but like any course, you'll need to be willing to put in the work.","He was really bad about explaining concepts. If the clicker questions reflected anything about how the class was doing, it wasn't looking good for him. Around 2/3 of the class would get the clicker questions wrong, and he STILL wouldn't stop to explain them. Avoid him","Lectures were clear and he was very helpful, not rude at all.","Lectures are interesting, but he can be a little off-putting. Don't be too offended if he goes off about the class's i-clicker mistakes; he's much more helpful if you ask questions. He's very good at explaining the mathematical side of physics. His more concrete demos aren't quite so consistent.","The class was moderately tough and he was a pretty ok lecturer, only thing is that he tends to make fun of students who get clicker questions wrong - which isn't called for.","Go to class for the clicker extra credit. He makes fun ofbelittles people who get the wrong answer on clicker questions and doesn't explain the answer clearly (""The answer is OBVIOUSLY this because *one sentence of an unclear explanation""). You'll have to work for an A.","Compared to some of the other professors, Adshead is relatively new, but his proofs are sound in a theoreticalmathematical sense and he knows what he's talking about. Can be a jerk in lecture (his explanations of clicker questions need work), but if you ask for help, he will do his best to help you. Also: he has a lovely New Zealand accent.","Adshead was a new professor in Fall 2014, but he taught like he was experienced. His lectures covered material reasonably well, and anything that was left out was easily available through SmartPhysics. Make sure to come to lectures, or you will lose significant points on the exams. Adshead is particularly good at explaining things mathematically."

So while attendance isn't mandatory, you're missing out on a huge portion of the class by skipping lecture. Only complaint is that is that the 1 midterm and 1 final can get you if you're not super prepared.","CS433 was a well instructed course taught by a passionate professor who truly cared about her students. Multiple times she would regularly ask us how the class was going (i.e. pacing, difficulty). The material was challenging (it's a 400 level course at UoI after all), but the ample resources and generous deadlines were enough to succeed.","Shocked to see the previous post. CS433 with Professor Adve is one of the most useful and inspiring courses I've taken in the CS department. The materials covered in this course are definitely hard, but the professor and the TA tried their best to make our lives easier. Been to both their office hours, I really appreciated their patience and help.","Excellent lectures. Really well versed in the material she teachers. Encourages lots of questions and exploring outside the basic curriculum. Hard tests with low averages, but thats alright when you're learning a lot!",Knows a lot about this stuff and makes an effort to make the class useful and interesting for everyone instead of strictly following book/slides,Terrible lecturer where the only reason most people went was to get iclicker points.  I watched all the lectures from the previous year online that had Craig Zilles teaching it.  She was very confusing and often wasted class time on useless things like trying to get students to ask questions when we had none and trying to learn 200 student's names.,Sarita is a great person. She is very excited about her research and teaching.,"Very engaging professor, very knowledgeable, class is very discussion based, encourages questions tailors discussions based on how class is responding. Great professor.","Excellent professor. She really cared about her students learning, and we had some excellent discussions in class resulting from student questions. It's not a hard class either - one midterm and a non-cumulative final and around seven homeworks. Would definitely recommend to anyone interested in architecture.","Her class is very discussion-driven. She will stop and answer if you have any questions. The material is not fixed for each class, so you can expect to learn everything crystal clearly.","She made sure you understood material.  I personally think it's a very boring subject, so it's terribly difficult to stay focused.  Only 4 written hws (25%) and 2 exams (1 midterm (37%) and 1 final (38%)).  Thus, if you make a stupid mistake on one of the exams, you are screwed.",Content was very solid.  Responsive to class feedback.  Exceeded my expectations. Good class.,Scatter-brained,She sucks!  Got an A though.,Not the most exciting.  But she cares about her students and will put forth her full effort to help you learn which is more than I can say about a lot of other profs.,"Lectures are very boring.

He knows the subject matter extremely well, very friendly, explains everything well. And goes easy on gradings as well :-)","He was a very average professor.  He seemed like a relatively friendly and approachable guy, but he didn't leave much of an impression on me.  He does a decent job of explaining the content, and 241 with him was moderately hard."

There's 3 midterms and a final. Homework is due every Thursday and you get a quiz every Tuesday in discussion (not bad if you have a good TA).","He is a really fun professor and he really cares about his students. His phone policy seems to be  really harsh at first, but it helps me focus more during the class. Go to every lecture, review the note and the problems we did you class, the test is not really hard. His lecture is really funny!!!. One last thing,  mute your phone during the class!","Ike cares about his students and wants them to succeed. He understands the course is somewhat difficult and because of that gives extra credit on every graded assignment, tests included so if you didn't understand one concept you can make up for it with the bonus problem. Cracks a joke every once and a while. REALLY good at Diff Eq., PDE's included",Ike really cared about the students. He was easy to understand and he often checked to make sure students understood what was going on. His exams were not very hard and if you got stuck he would normally help you or the whole class.

Even though the examlets were longer than the other sections', his grading was very fair (he generously curved individual exams with lower averages). In addition, he was very accessible via email and by far the most reasonable and caring professor I've encountered at UIUC","The exams were all over the place in length, difficulty and style. His lectures were boring and uninspired.  Wasted 15 minutes, without fail, each day getting the smartboard to work. Study resources were scarce as the textbook wasn't followed closely and no feedback was given on discussion assignments. Exam solutions were also extremely late.","The exams are kind of hard, but they are sometimes quite similar with the old exams. And you are allowed to try several times to get the highest score for each of your homework. He is generous on grading that he would scale the scores up if the overall grade was not ideal. But you may not learn much during the lecture.","I'm so glad I'm taking this class for the first semester as an undergraduate because it gives me so much confidence that I can learn things all by myself. I'm not going to hesitate to choose 1 point professor anymore.   He is actually very cute, smiling all the time. The material is more difficult than the other section. Useful?- I don't know.",Reads off of slides and doesn't explain the material well (expects for you to have an above average understanding of the material presented),Can't listen a word if you go to the lecture. He seems so into his own world and do not care about what his students are doing. Exams are so much harder than the other section.,"One of the worst professors at UIUC. He comes to a 50 minutes class 10-15 minutes late. Mostly tries to read slides, but even that not correctly, he mumbles, makes mistakes, does not correct himself. It's a mystery to me how he conducts research.","The material is already pretty hard to understand, and the professor simply reads off the slides (from 10 years ago) in lectures. MPs are poorly designed and often contain mistakes. Although the final grade cutoff was pretty generous, it's not an enjoyable class and you don't really learn much.","Hard, not very interesting subject material made worse than it had to be. Not sure if uninterested or just totally lacks lecturing skill. Reading the book section the lecture slides had been taken from was much more helpful than lecture. Despite 10% extra credit attendance quizzes almost no one showed up.","He put zero effort in this class: the ""lecture"" consisted of him reading ppt slides that had code copy-pasted from the book; the MPs were unclear and they changed the requirements multiple times before the deadline (even the day it was due, for the last one); the exams contained bogus material; two out of the three TAs were useless","Agha is not a great lecturer. A lot his lecture slides were just lines and lines of code which he skimmed by very quickly while mumbling. The MPs were *terrible*, although I believe that one of the TAs (Minas) was in charge of those. TONS of revisions and extensions due to bugs, and an incredible amount of confusion and anger on piazza.","MP's were scarcely debugged before release, prompting multiple confusing changes. MP's are generally brutal and have little connection to the lectures, which lack student interaction and are taught quite badly. Office hours aren't too helpful and tests are too long for the average student to finish. Overall, more trouble than this class was worth."

Seriously restored my faith in the university education.",It is a tough no nonsense class from a professor who will spend three hours on a Friday eve teaching you because you happened to drop in his office with confusions. Be careful with regular reading and u will do fine.,One of my favorite professors at UIUC. Class is case based so make sure you pick a good group because you work with them at least once a week and its a lot of the course points. Keeps the lectures interesting and always tries to make jokes. If you like math take LIM for 378 if not and you like case studies and analyzing them then take this class.,"My sweet and sincere suggestion to evryone. Do not take this course with Agrawal. I ended up with a C my mate ended with a D.  He will not listen to you if you tell him about your job or anything and will not change the grade. For your sanity do what many of my folks did takethis course with Lim, you will not get less than B.","Don't know why the hard label, Anupam is funny, and helping. Group projects, and a video project. The mid term was okish, and the class so far seems cool.","Best professor I've had at UIUC. He is a great lecturer and makes sure that the students understand.

Unreservedly recommended for those interested in supply chains. Follow the material closely and beware of the final (much more difficult than the already-difficult quizzes). Do not take during a busy semester for your GPA's sake.,"overall solid class, but concerns.... does not curve, and I think he does not give too many + or - so u may end up with A or B or C... easy to approach, use office hours... does not pay attention to excuses, don't try","Very demanding subject, cold calling and using i-clicker for attendance and participation. Not tough but tricky midterm. Jokes seems to be fun but seldom get it. My expectation was much higher. Too many cases, not in depth analysis for some of them. He uses negative words for students' midterm review. But he is confident and fair in grading.","Last comment is spot on. Hard class, be very careful with case readings and problems. Most useful class for me in 4 years. Also, My lowest grade in last three years - by the time I realized this wasn't an easy A, the damage was done. Prof expects too much, but other than this, frankly there is really nothing much to complain.","He is fun, but this certainly was not an easy class. 12 case writeups, project, 3 assignments, one mid term and one end term, both very tough. Uses Clickers for attendance (in fairness, also for learning). Yes it was fun, but very hard.","Anupam is not only fun, as previous posters said. I would add that he is open, generous and genuine. He was the only Prof in my two years MBA to invite me (and my whole class) to his home, where he and his wife cooked for us! Well, I still remember all the case studies-- he demands that we handwrite the write-ups :-(....",He is hilarious!!! Such an interesting man and makes the class material interesting.,"Goood case studies, handouts. Tough quiz. boring project, but WTH. One of the few classes where the prof was interested more in our learning (and my job!) than in dishing out old material. hats off!","Anupam is FUN !!

He is open to honest and critical feedback, continuously trying to improve his classroom experience. He likes his students to engage during lectures, often through Q&amp;As. He tends to be quite active on Piazza, answering student queries. You won't be disappointed!",Great professor that listen to student's feedback,"My first rating on this website. Prof. Abdu is a fantastic teacher and a really nice person. Exams and homeworks were hard, but I did learn a lot. I would encourage you to go to his lecture.

And do the extra credit SONA studies, you need at least a 94% in the class to get an A. Dolores is an awful lecturer so you better hope you like your TA","Assuming there isn't a strike going on you should be fine, but know she has no idea what being a student is like. Thanks for admitting you basically expect us to teach ourselves, because 2 weeks out 16 with out lecture doesn't extend a test. But hey, at least we know this class has a Professor now!","I took this class for Gened and this is a TA-led course. There are tons of multiple choice questions for each test without any curve. I couldn't believe that the grading scale was changed after the class began. If you get 89-92, you are only a B+... 90% of your grade will be from tests and quizzes. Be careful to take this class unless psyc major.","This is a TA-led course, so I can't comment on her and the ratings are really for her TA.  I had Pete Ondish and he was awesome.  Funny, down to Earth, super helpful (and also really handsome, but anyway).  The course isn't difficult but if you want it to be interesting know that the class experience is dependent on the TA."

Easy gen ed but super interesting.,"This class has no tests, just alternating reflective posts and quizzes every other week (7 of each). Lecture PPTs are posted online and are fill in the blank, so attend class. Sarah makes lectures fun, some are more fun than others. As long as you show up and get the lecture notes, you'll pass quizzes and reflective posts with A's. Very easy GenEd.","Great Western Civ. Ged Ed! Only 7 quizes and 7 reflective posts and no exams. Some lectures were difficult to sit through, like Dog Fighting lecture, but a really easy A.","This class is awesome. Easy A and also interesting. This is really rare people-- interesting Easy A course. If you are looking for easy gen ed, ANSC 250 is the best choice. I really enjoyed this class. Exams pretty much from the lecture and videos. She also brings her dog. FUN!","Her notes are fill in the blank so that's easy enough. No textbook &amp; HW every other week or less often than that later in the semester. She randomly gives out extra credit opportunities (like twice a semester). She makes us watch tons of videos but the course is extremely easy. All you have to do is show up, stay awake and you'll easily get an A.","Worthless class. The professor requires you to show up, takes attendance, and then doesn't teach. She doesn't lecture; rather, students are required to show up so they can sit and work quietly on ""group projects."" You are forced to teach yourself rather than be taught by the professor, although it's an in-person class. Waste of time.",Professor Albert is awesome and her class is very interesting.  Despite the easiness of the class I never skipped because of how awesome the lectures are.  Sometimes she brings service dogs into class which is very exciting for anyone who loves dogs.,I loved this class. By far one of the best classes I've taken on campus. The lectures were interesting- she draws on a lot of important issues. She does not assign much homework and she gives extra credit. Her tests are easy!,Easiest course I have ever taken. All the tests were online and somebody provided a study guide of all the notes (questions are taken directly from them) on StudyRoom so I only went to class once all semester. Reflective posts were easy and informative. I learned a decent amount even though I did barely anything . Got an A without doing the E.C.,"ANSC 250 is definitely a very easy gen ed. The tests are all online and there's no textbook, they're only based on the lecture notes she provides. You should go to class though because her notes are fill in the blank &amp; you won't be able to get the answers without going. It's the easiest class i've taken at U of I.","Sarah is awesome.  The lectures are actually really interesting; I genuinely enjoyed them.  She is really nice and there was hardly any work for the class.  There was only one paper, discussion posts, and a few tests.  The paper was super easy-- it was really just a completion grade.  The tests are straight forward.  I would totally take her again!","Took both ANSC250 and 305 with her. She's really helpful, passionate about teaching, replies your email in lightning speed. Class materials easy but interesting. The only complain is you have homework every week.",This class is VERY easy and so interesting!,"If you're looking for an easy and interesting Western gen ed, this is it. While Albert uses iClickers, the questions are all opinion based, so there's no obligation to pay attention during class. As long as you go to class and listen, there's no reason why you shouldn't get an A on all the tests, the essays are practically completion grades."

Math 417 is a difficult course and per math stackexchange the best way to learn the material is do as many exercises as possible;  the amount of homework makes sense, but it is cumbersome.

He assigns lots of homework but grader only grades part of them. However, the homework only counts for 25%, and he gives easy exams with bonus question, which makes it possible to get more than 100 in exams. After Exam 1, 50% of students are in A range.","Wonder why he got so many positive comments. Worst math professor so far. Leave you tons of nonsense borin homework to do, which means you need to spend about 10 hours in 2 days to hand them in.

I really appreciated the historical anecdotes he threw into lectures about where the math came from.  Best math class here so far.","Amazing teacher, crazy brilliant.  Sometimes it's hard to follow his work, but he will definitely go back and explain *if you ask him to*  Always excited to go to his lecture and try to learn; he is an excellent teacher for an incredibly hard class.","He is one of the best teachers in the math dept., and is very organised.

You will come out of the class learning so much and I know kids who fought to have him.","Awesome artist and professor, but encourages students to think more inside the box with their work.

It also makes it easier when you get to check her out :P","She's funny and she tries to make things clear.  She definitely knows her stuff.  She can also grade a little harshly, but if you do what she asks it's not bad.","I took the James Scholar section with Ingrid.

Just a really personable, smart, effective teacher.","Very solid professor. Good lectures, very approachable. Only issue is he takes a long time to get grades back. But nothing you're graded on is ever a surprise--very clear rubrics. So it's not that huge a deal. Charming, too. He's very into students doing critical thinking and coming up with their own narratives, so there's room to be creative.","Amazing professor. I took HIST259 (as GenED) with him and there are only 2 essays, one midterm, and one final. There is a ""Textbook"" that we use that helps from time to time, but if you go to lectures and just try to understand how he is connecting the quotes to a bigger them, you will get an A. Overall, his lectures are pretty fun and enjoyable.",This was the first time that he was teaching the class and he really didn't know what he was doing. He was insanely unorganized (like we didn't get our first grade until there was 3 weeks left in the semester unorganized). Whenever he gave projects/exams he was very vague and changed his mind a lot. Overall this class gave me the biggest headache.,"He's a really down to earth guy, very funny and easy to talk to outside of class, and extremely knowledgeable about his field. It can be hard to keep up with him in lecture, as he doesn't tend to cover much in depth, but that's really well balanced with how well and easily he grades.","He is super smart. He cares about everyone's success in the class. However, he relies a bit too much on class discussion.

The exams were not too bad, except I thought the final was a little obscure.  MATH 242 was certainly easier than 220/230.","At first i thought he was so rough cuz his first exam was based on random problems, then he figured that everyone did bad on the first exam so he start making the 2nd and 3rd exams exactly the same as the practices, Thank GOD! and THANK HIM! he is such a great prof.","a good math teacher, he teaches off the chalkboard and does lots of examples. i never had trouble understanding him and i sat in the back row every day. his tests are too hard though, because they test tricky stuff rather than a basic grasp of the material, but everyone does bad, so the curve helps.","I eventually got used to his accent, but it is very thick.

Make sure you go to every lecture AND participate because she very specific on attendance points.  Exams consists of long free response, and will off multiple points for not having ONE point that she mentioned in class. Way too difficult for a 200 level course.","Do not take this class if you won't put in tons of work reading. You have to memorize the text and put it on paper if not you will not get a good grade. You have too be way to specific otherwise, you get a 0. Way to hard of a class for being 200 level. Lectures are just review of the text and saying what you memorized for participation points.","I learned a TON in this class due to all of the 'required' readings. I feel like her lectures were robotic and follow the book to the T. If you read the book, her lectures are almost useless, yet participation AND attendance are required. She is a harsh grader on everything and the tests were the hardest i have taken in the ACE curriculum.","Shes an amazing teacher, and her classes are interesting. Not a lot of homework, but her tests are the hardest things I've ever had at UIUC. She really makes you work for a good grade, but you do walk away feeling you actually learned quite a bit","Like everyone else said, tough on the grades. I read the articles, and am I very good writer, and still managed to get a B-. Do not regret taking the class though, the information learned is amazing, I just wish she was easier on the tests. Bring pencils, the tests are ridiculously long, and all essays.",Normal level readings BUT as previous post. Brutal grader!!! Answers for the tests arey never enough...she always find a way not to get you a full credit. Extremely hard grader. Only take it if you will be there 100% of time &amp; do 100% of readings/homework and participate (she grades it harshly)...Not much else...,brutual class,Moderate class and great Professor! Lot's of reading but it's a 400-level after all. Test are in between easy and moderate if you ACTUALLY read the assigned readings &amp; go to class.

She does the same for assignments and tests, she wants you to answer like she would. Also can't skip and no technology.",Class is extremely boring. Notes can be found online or in the textbook. Exams are okay. Grading scale is very unusual. Professor Allendorf makes a lot of mistakes and argued that a 100 out of 150 was a 100%. This was the first class that I ever took that had a down curve. Will not take another class from her.,"Prof Allendorf is great! Theres a slideshow lecture every Tuesday and then easy readings for homework and very easy, short quizzes every Thursday.

Not understanding at all. Grading procedure was not fair at all.,"Class is incredibly boring, and while not mandatory, there are random days when you can get participation points for being in class. Homework is easy if you pay attention. Discussion sections are absolutely a waste of time though. 4 exams, none are too difficult if you know the content. Does curve grades fairly, which is awesome!",She has a very good knowledge of the subject matter and does well to explain it. Show up and pay attention and you should be fine.,"Her demographics methods course is pretty hard. I would choose another advanced methods SOC class unless you are really competent in math. No attendance, no extra credit, no curving. Don't really need to buy the book even though she says you do to get the cd. She is nice but can be tricky and a stickler to her own rules."

No questions asked. He also loves dolomite,"Prof. Altaner is everything you want in a Professor. He recognizes that many of students are taking his class just for hours, and caters to them well.

Stephen shows cartoons at the beginning of each lecture, and they are actually pretty entertaining, as corny as they seem. The class is pretty lax and interesting, and all the opportunities for extra credit make it an easy A. He's a BOSS","Pretty funny guy, clearly loves teaching this class. Gives a few unannounced quizzes. Notes are put online. Lecture is generally pretty entertaining/worth showing up for. Didn't ever use the book. Homework is a pain but not difficult.","GEOL110 was a ton of fun if you can bear to give up two weekends. If you're interested you'll learn a lot. Get ready to go hiking (and bring your jacket).   Prof. Altaner is a great guy. The classroom lectures can be slow, but the field trips are great. Ask him questions; he'll tell you about all kinds of cool geology stuff.","Came into the class thinking it was the easy disaster class (ATMS 120). Class for nonmajors but he expects you to know everything in extreme detail. His homework assignments aren't incredibly hard but I can't seem to get above a B average on them. They have nothing to do with lecture. Absolutely no possibilit of cheating on tests, don't count on it","Lectures you don't have to go to because its all online, plus his lectures are boring.","Very interesting class. Cool topics and shows awesome videos. Commentates with his own humor throughout class. 3 exams including the final, all non-cumulative and practice examsquestions provided. Got A's on all three just reviewing notes and practice tests. Notes provided-just added some pictures and comments. Class website very helpful.",He makes it harder than it has to be. It is so difficult to take notes in his class and his corny jokes are terrible.,"Great professor.

The class is not hard, attendance is fairly important because of the pop quizzes.  Can't recommend him and this class enough","Super easy class. As long as you keep up with the course notes, it's and easy A. Although attendance is not mandatory, there are 3 pop quizzes throughout the semester. However they are only worth 6% of the grade, and there is one extra credit assignment worth 5% bonus, so missing quizzes won't cost you much. I highly recommend this class.","One of the easiest classes I have ever taken. Lectures are non-mandatory, but it's good to go just in case one of the three pop quizzes shows up. 500 word writing assignment. 3 random quizzes. and 3 Exams. Exams are the easiest thing ever. Just go to the Question/Answer Session the night before, and you'll be fine. Only 1 Quiz between each exam.","Professor Altaner leads a pretty interesting class with awesome videos and examples. There are a couple tests which are more challenging and you need to put in more time then you think.

There are 14 quizzes worth 20 points each, but he drops the 4 lowest ones, making this class an easy A. Usually there is one question on the quizzes that is hard, but the rest are straight from the notes. A+ teacher!","Definitely my most interesting class this semester! No textbook, no midterm, and no final.  Not hard at all to get an A.  He makes the neurology easy to understand and he's very approachable; overall a great professor.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS CLASS!",You can tell he made the class with students in mind. NO textbook is required and he makes lectures fun and interesting. He's very approachable and tries to answer everyones questions in class. Also his lectures are full of funny photos.,Excellent professor. Made science fun and relatable. Never thought I'd have enjoyed neurology so much. Society and the Brain is an excellent elective; I'm an accounting major and I had no trouble at all understanding the material - so don't be intimidated.

Overall the course was honestly a little tougher than I expected. Expectations were clear, the only small gripe I has with this class was the exams were a tad long for the test structure she had us do.",Just be sure to study for exams and you'll be okay.,"Probably more difficult than most 100 level courses, but it doesn't take much studying to understand the concepts.","Professor Anders obviously has a passion for Geology, but she is horrible at teaching. Often flustered and the slides are sometimes unorganized and even incorrect. I understand she wants you to think outside the box, but for an intro Geology class, it's extremely difficult. The tests are insanely hard, even after preparing for them for many hours.","The class is ridiculously graded considering it is a 100-level course. Anders expects students to basically know the material themselves before she even teaches anything. If you're not an engineer, good luck.","Geology with prof. Anders is not difficult, if you read the textbook. She also lets you work in groups for part of the exams, which are not terribly difficult. Attendance is mandatory in the sense that there are in-class assignments during about a third of the lectures, which count for a small fraction of your final grade.","We learned a good amount of material. Never was overwhelming. Test material was divided pretty graciously and if you go to her, she is enthusiastic to help. Not a technical course. Read your chapter over before class, and it will be easy. If you aren't interested in science/environment or how things work, it will be boring sometimes. Lab is easy."

Great for people who take ACCY seriously.",Genuinely one of the worst instructors I have ever taken.

Really really disliked spending 4 hours a week in this class.,"Good prof, very understanding.  Taking the class online now and it is HORRIBLE.  The TAs are condescending, grade with a bias, don't answer emails, and everything is about how evil white people are.  I regret the money I spent on this class.",The prof. is great.

All you do is discuss how horrible America is...plus is you enjoy writing 40+ pages and fail because their grading is bias then you will love this class...NOT! Waste of $$$!,"Anderson was a great teacher; the TAs are what ruined the class for me. Directions on writing assignments were very vague, and not made clear until after the due date. The TAs basically were the teachers, and very unfair in their grading. I feel the same way about the class as the comment before mine. Biased grading. Left class upset many times.","The professor isn't the problem! ""Race and Cultural Diversity""  -what a joke. 99% of what we talk about is how horrible the white race is and 95% of that time it is specifically about white-black discrimination. REAL diverse.

As long as you read the material and are fairly interested in what you are learning,  you should be fine.",She was very unorganized with the syllabus. Didn't explain the grading system clearly at all which did harm for a lot of students. She all of a sudden at the end of the semester said that she is not going to include any EC assignments already done by students in the final grade. She is definitely very passionate about the class though.,"She's very unorganized and not stick to the syllabus at all. However, she is open to discussions and values your opinions, and does not care about grammar in your assignments.

Class is disorganized and lectures are pointless,"If you don't have a solid background in chemistry from high school, you'll probably struggle. Tests are difficult to an unnecessary degree, and there is barely any actual teaching during lecture. If you have a good TA to teach you the concepts, you have a much better chance at doing well in the class.

I am so glad that I could take his lecture this semester.","Ando is an awesome professor, always willing to help out and explain things in a different way until you understand.  416 is a tough course and he made the intro to abstract math pretty painless for the most part.","Ando is an awesome professor; very clear/concise, very fair grader, and makes coming to lecture worth it with great examples and anecdotes. Yes, it's the engineering section, so it's a bit harder than a regular section of Calc II, but if you do the work and ask him/the TAs questions, you'll be guaranteed to get a good grade","He knows what he is doing, and is very funny and enthusiastic about the material. If you like math jokes, he's the teacher for you... he's also the teacher for you if you like it when professors occasionally go on tangents. An awesome guy, and very helpful.","Great professor. Some people have called Math 231 the ""engineering weed out"" class--it was difficult at times, but Professor Ando did a great job lecturing and was very helpful. He was a native English speaker, and he projected well without shouting. He was a very pleasant person, too--he always had good stories.","He's pretty funny and a good storyteller. However, u can afford to miss his classes and still easily get excellent marks just by reading the text (James Stewart-Early Transcendentals) coz the exams are pretty easy. Otherwise, he teaches well, though the examples he shows are sometimes taken directly from the book. His board work is pretty clear too",He's a great storyteller,he is a champ,"Ando is a great professor. The class is really hard, but if you have any questions at all, go to office hours. He helps with homework and will do his best to make sure you understand everything about the problem.","I feel that any bad review would reflect Ghrist and not Ando. He was a great lecturer and if the had a course all to himself it would have been much better. Unfortunately, Ghrist wrote the ridiculous homework and the tests varied from what we were taught. No textbook, which sucks. In spite of that...Ando = good guy",Great professor. good at explaining and funny. unfortunately taught class with ghrist and beck who are no good.,Great professor although he tended to fall behind the other section.

If you read the lecture notes and have a decent TA, you should get an A.","Very nice, excited about his job. But I think I may have learned more about his son than calculus.

There are three exams (including the final) practice exams and reviews are provided,"This class is somewhat easy.BUT it is easy to fall behind.

He seems unhappy to be a calculus 3 professor because he thinks much more of himself.,"Dr. Anema is a very strange but very effective teacher.

His tests while challenging were not impossible if you studied, attended lectures and discussions, and TA hours for the Web Assigns. One of the best!","He isn't funny or anything, but he is happy and wants to genuinely teach you. He is the best of the Math 241 professors my year and explains well. He sometimes gets mad if you don't do what he wants during lecture so always pick that you want to see a difficult example.",Dr. Anema is an awesome guy who explains difficult concepts very well. Students from other sections will ditch theirs to hear his lectures because of how clear he is. Available after class for further clarifications.,"He does teach the content well, but sometimes goes about it in a round-about way that confuses me.

I would suggest that you do not take any of his classes.  His teaching methods stinks.,"Good class...very easy-to-understand.  He does a good job of making things explainable.

Her grading was fair and listens to her students' request like how much homework is too much.","Study guides given before exams correlated very well with the material that was on the tests.  Difficulty leaned toward easy. Averages were usually high(around 85 percent). The downside was that lectures were generally a summary of the book, which made things confusing at times. Reading the book on your own will cover whatever is done in lecture.","Very nice lady, but her lectures often got very confusing. Her tests were extremely difficult with memorization of proofs, which made the class not even feel like a math class. And the biggest problem was lectures were straight from the book, so if you didn't understand the lecture, there was no other reference","All she did was copy her notes onto the chalkboard. Had a lot of examples but wouldn't go through the work for each step making it difficult to follow along. Her exams are worth 17% each with only 4-6 questions, making it easy to lose a lot of overall percentage points on one question. I wish I would have taken a section with a different professor.","She is the best math teacher I've had at U of I. Being an athlete, it's not too demanding. Homework really helps for tests. She keep class entertaining by making awesome comments about her kids. I've had her in multiple classes. She is chill.",She is the first good math teacher that I have had in a long time. She explains the material well and interacts with the students.  She makes a big class feel small and students fell comfortable asking questions.  There is mandatory homework every week but it is not bad.  If you are taking this class definitely take it with her!,"Liked the way this course was structured. Lectures were always interesting, she talked about her kids and funny random stuff sometimes. Material was pretty clear. Quizzes were fair. Exams were very similar to practice exams. She's approachable and I'm considering taking her again for another math course.","She is a great professor and ALWAYS willing to help. Her tests were difficult at times. A lot of the times she would include things that we did not focus on as much as others during lecture and in the homework problems.

Also, all course notes are online.",Fantastic teacher. We got let out early most days and she breaks up straight lecturing to tell little stories about her family. I enjoyed the slight mental break.

Her class was very challenging, but not impossible.",Best teacher for this course but her tests aren't fair and there is nothing you can do about it no matter how much you study,"Had her for MATH 125 and 234. I think she is entertaining and keeps the class lively. She adjusted to a new university smoothly. 125 was a bit confusing in her explanation, but 234 was much better. Maybe adjustment problems? USE THE BOOK FOR EXTRA PRACTICE. She takes homework/exam problems from it (sometimes altered slightly).","This was her first semester teaching Linear Algebra, and I'm pretty sure she's the best professor I've had to date.  She was very personable, gave very clear notes, and made great exam study guides.  The exams also adhered very well to what we had covered in class and done in homework and were very straightforward.","Probably the best teacher you can get for this course. I didn't go to class that often since all of her notes are online, but in class she explains material better. Quizzes were mostly straight forward. Got a B in the class.","I was among the first to have professor Arana at the University this past semester. She is clearly a mom who loves her children as she brings them up a lot in class. Very funny and clear with her expectations. Go to her office hours if you are having trouble, one on one help was everything!! Class was challenging but not impossible.","Professor Arana did a great job with this class this past semester. It was her first semester at the University of Illinois, but that did not stop her from doing a quality job. She is passionate about what she is teaching. The material was not too difficult.

You will learn a whole lot taking this class and it's definitely not a blow off! You'll spend a good chunk of time doing not so easy warm ups, but the class is really fun and engaging. No complaints!","Quite possibly the worst teacher at this school.

Only negative is he can lecture for an hour before each class.","the worst as program advisor. never reads/replies emails, never answers calls, and if you need a letter from him, you better write it yourself and make him sign it","Professor Armstrong is by far the worst professor teaching in the Architecture school. I took Arch 171 in Fall 2005 and he hardly taught. He just said ""um"" a ton. He tried to fail everyone in my studio subsection because he thought we weren't ready for achitecture even though we had A's and B's on most of the projects.

It's like being in front of a hypnotist.  Lectures are completely boring.  You Prof. Armstrong really cares about the subject, but he is definately not a teacher that inspires greatness in others.","His lecture is absolutely boring. He could spend a full two hour lecture on how to draw the line using pen.... feel like dying. He didn't stop by studio much, which is a good thing. The other thing is that he never gives out the grade. You have no idea on how u are doing in that class... it could be very scary for students. Good luck for those...","It reminds me of a Simpsons episode where Ned Flanders goes off about how people with good intentions are not good.  He tries, he obviously does, but he is so boring.  He also goes on tangents all the time which prolong lecture and gave us less time to work on our projects.","he is quite nice somehow, yet, like what other said, he is boring and monotonous, keep saying the same thing over and over again. his standard is very high too, not impossible, but I think it's too high for a freshman class","I almost feel bad for Professor Armstrong... he seems like he is probably a really nice guy, but as was mentioned before, he is INCREDIBLY boring and, consequently, did not make a very good design professor.

Also, he gives a pretty decent curve. Reading the textbook really helps, unless you pay close attention to class. Written portion of exam resembles the homework. The professor is helpful, but expects a bit more from students than the other econ professors at the university.",No interests in rating any prof unless he is really horrible. If you are confident about your intelligence take his class and challenge yourself plz. Exams are really difficult. He is helpful in person but it has nothing to do with your grade  Def avoid him.,"Horrible teacher to be honest. Exam does not cover anything learned in class. If you could avoid this teacher, do it.",Exam was so much hard.,"Nice guy if you go to his office hours &amp; helpful if you ask him questions. However! Beware that this class has really, really hard test that are based of each previous questions, which means that for example if you get part a wrong, then your entire answer for the other parts will be wrong and you could miss up to 20 points for it!! Hated this test",He is a nice and great professor. I like him. The thing is the exams are quite hard.,"Horrible, just reads you the notes in class. Exam questions are like the HW assignments but he never goes over it or teaches you anything that's on the HW. Self taught class, you'll be lucky if you get a C. 12 point curve on a 100 scale though."

Comes unprepared to classes and exams (our exam started 20 minutes late). Extremely strict about grades, won't change even if he is wrong. Do not take.","Challenging, motivating, and fair! One of my best instructors so far! Bright brings real life practice problems to class. It can't wait to take his auditing class next semester! He may be rigid with rules and tough on grading but he curves the grade in the end.","Bright is a great teacher! He is very enthusiastic and highly experienced. He is challenging, motivating, and fair. You will never sleep in his class! He has office hours and also available on appointment. I recommend you always complete the assigned readings and watch his micro lectures before going to class.",He is a terrible communicator so if you try to email him don't expect a response. He grades super hard and he barely teaches you any material because he is all about discovery learning and learning for ourselves. When we were struggling we were told to wash our face. He also showed little care to the students,"All around awful. Do not take his summer Accy 301 class. He is terrible at communicating what needs to be done, he's never around to help, and it didn't seem like he cared about the students at all. He knows his stuff so his lectures are in depth and interesting but if you are looking for a good grade in 301 in a summer section this isn't the guy","Exceptional teacher with lots of practice and industry experience! He is a difficult grader, but he cares so much about students. I really recommend his class for every student. He is so funny too and create jokes in class. But you always have to be on top of the readings and be prepared to be called upon to answer questions in class!!","Great as a person, not so much as a professor. Bright is hilarious, but his explanations are confusing and discussions move slowly because no one reads the 50-60 page chapters. Know the journal entries for all types of problems for the exams.","he is very knowledgeable but thats it. He will not help you learn the material because he is too cocky and thinks you should learn it on your own. Every class starts by him saying ""I assume you read the book and watch the videos so we won't go over that.""

She uses notes that have all the problem answers explained so theres nothing you can't understand,if you do all the probs in the notes you're fine for the tests. No tests get dropped or curved, all points are from tests so you have to be on your toes,88% is an A however.","I wouldn't recommend her class at all. She uses her own class notes, which are rather confusing. Fortunately I had already learned most of the material in other classes so I did well. Overall I found the class pretty worthless. It's not hard to get an A in her class, but if you want to learn the material, take it with a different professor.","A good lecturer, but her exams are very somewhat difficult.  More importantly, she does not curve and is a harsh grader.  I was a tenth of a point away from a B- and she wouldn't bump my grade up.  Don't expect any sympathy from her.","A very good professor, get on her good side early and keep up with the homework.","Lot's of feedback throughout the course.

Online discussions are a headache, but as long as you do them, you get full points.","Good teacher. Very biased when explaining concepts though. Read and go to lectures, and it will be pretty easy.","Classes are quite enjoyable, and easy enough. The textbook is irrelevant if you go to class, or vice versa. Class is optional, but thats where he gives extra credit opportunities.",Prof. Ashley does not know how to operate technology to a sufficient degree. He once attempted to play a YouTube video in class and it took at least 5 minutes for him to figure out how to play it. The course website is a mess because of his inability to format it correctly.,"Professor Ashley is a very energetic instructor. His lectures are always very interesting. You leave each lecture knowing something new. Do not skip class; do the readings, and don't be lazy. Do these three things, and you'll be fine.","He teaches a hybrid class which consists of online discussions and a once per week lecture. If you don't go to lecture, you're basically screwed. He's a good professor, but it's often unclear as to what material gets covered on exams. In addition, Prof Ashley is an EIU prof, so he doesn't have office hours.

But if 1 problem got wrong, you will lose 8 or 10 pts. The class structure is disaster. Group study does little help on learning, but waste class time. Lectures are unrelated with homeworks.",He is a nice guy but the class structure is not so good! I disagree that the class is group projects. It was the students forced to teach each other and even lecture in front of the class! Textbook is also not so good because it requires understanding group theory but math 402 is not a requirement!,"Jayadev is an excellent instructor who clearly loves math. He's a total and unabashed nerd for math; for some (like me) this is great, for others not so much. He's always extremely helpful in office hours and his assignments and grading are completely fair. His math 301 class has group projects and a final paper but no exams.","The exams weren't too bad. He was a great professor, in my opinion.",Very smart guy but horrible at lecturing. Doesn't understand why people don't comprehend all of calc 3 as easily as he does. Gets pretty frustrated when people ask questions and uses powerpoints to teach (it doesn't work super well). I would steer clear of him if you could,Terrible at teaching and had an awful personality to deal with when trying to get help or communicate about classwork.,Not a suitable teacher for the level of the course.,One of the worst professors I have EVER had.

I had to learn everything on my own! He is getting paid to do nothing at all! DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS!!!,"Prof Athreya is not a very good lecturer. He is overconfident to a fault and his lectures are straight from the textbook. I would recommend a different lecturer. Most of the test material is also right in the book. The textbook is a must have, though I recommend choosing a different lecturer.","If you have any other choices besides this professor, please pick the other one. I have to say his lectures can actually make you even more confused on the subject that is being taught. After the first exam, I did not attend one lecture and surprisingly got an A on the second midterm. Just dont pick this guy.","I feel like when Professor Athreya lectures he is just telling you what he knows, which comes off as slightly smug. When it comes to lecturing you have to prove to your students that the concepts make sense. Not just tell them with a smile. I'll be back next semester too if wants to give it another try.",Did't even bother going to his lectures. Just read the book by myself and learned on my own. The TA was really nice and was the only useful resource in the course.,The worst professor ever. nothing helpful. DONT GO TO CLASS.,"No practice exams, only goes over theory in class, and no examples, and is very cocky.",He is the cockiest professor I've met. He focuses too much on the technicalities of running the class without focusing on the actual content. His lectures are completely useless because he is so vague and his ppt slides are just scans of the book. He also rarely provides examples to the concepts he's teaching. Just use Paul's Online Math Notes.,If you learn math well from powerpoint definitions this is your guy. Too smart for his own good. Cant believe I pay to go listen to him.,"He's a pretty poor professor. His ego is off the charts, and he doesn't attend his own office hours. Completely unprofessional, and he even stated in class that he refuses to do examples. I would try to avoid him if I were you.","His way of ""teaching"" consists of throwing out definitions and expecting you to ask your TA if you need any real help. You essentially have to teach yourself from the book. He also gets distracted really easily by phones and conversation, and will stop class for 5 minutes just to complain about it."

His lecture is more like listening to grandfathers' stories; they are full of insights and personal experiences, which make the knowledge alive. To study, you MUST attend class, because class notes are the only source of exam material, which is fair","You have to try really hard to pay attention in lectures to understand what he's saying. Once you can follow him, you'll find the topics understandable. One five pages paper, one midterm, four quizzes, one final. Choose a good TA. Seems like you're A if you're the top 20% in your class. So don't need to worry if you find the exams  hard.","Baer is very well accomplished in his field - however, it's clear he doesn't care about this class (not that I blame him.)  Your grade is pretty dependent on how good your TA is/how easy your TA grades.  Definitely not as easy as microeconomics.","Lectures can be boring but Baer knows a lot about economics. He is passionate about economics. There are only 2 tests, a midterm and a final. There is also a term paper which requires 5 pages. Discussion can be very helpful to clarify things.","Baer is an awesome guy, but not an awesome teacher. His lectures are boring and when I look around the auditorium it is not uncommon to see many kids sleeping. Your grade will depend on the TA you get since they all grade differently. Tests are all essay questions, no multiple choice, and are extremely difficult. Never once used the book.","It's hard to stay awake for his lectures, even though he does know the material.  My TA helped out a lot with clearing things up because he goes off on tangents a lot.  Only four quizzes (one dropped), a paper, midterm and final.",Boring and confusing lectures- but the tests are curved so much you can still get an A if you listen to your TA in discussion.,"A little dry, but a good professor overall. He's much better one on one than in a giant lecture hall, but either way, Dr. Baer is incredibly knowledgable and effectively imparts students with the knowledge they need to succeed.

Baer is a really smart guy but he just isn't a great speaker. The teaching assistants are even worse with their broken english. Not too difficult. The textbook is pretty useless so be careful before shelling out a bunch of money for it.,"Class only has 4 quizzes, a essay, a midterm and a final. As such, if you want to do well in the class, make sure you do well in all your assignments. Luckily, the final and midterm are for the most part curved. The lectures are helpful but dry: if you manage to stay awake you can actually learn quite a bit from Baer.","don't want to take his classes, again. Horrible.",boring and hard,"If you go to class everyday, this should be a walk in the park. Make sure to have the TA look over your research paper.","His lectures can be pretty boring, but they are the best way to learn the material in my opinion. I didn't even open the book once. Just study your notes and also make sure you go to your TA to look your essay over before you turn it in. A good grade on that will really help you out. The tests are hard but he curves them. He's helpful in office hrs",so boring. not sure if it was easy or i just couldn't pay attention. midterm average was 67%... very boring. try to pay attention. its definitely manageable to get an a but its just SO boring.,As I had already learnt most of the content in high-school I decided not to go to class as he is extremely boring and it is hard to stay up in class and I believed that i could get through the class only using textbook but it is VERY important to go to lecture even if u fall asleep since the material on the test is mainly what he says in class.

Her powerpoint is well-organized. She has done so many research and some of them are used by the textbook! I like her so much",She's really sweet. And she's done amazing research. I feel ridiculously fortunate to have had her as a professor. Class is not difficult. Show up to class with lecture slides printed out and write down any extra information she may say. That's all you have to do. I got over 100 in the class because it was so easy. Tests are all multiple choice.,"Taking Dr. Baillargeon's class was a pleasure. Lectures are clear and concise, and exams are straightforward (although you'll definitely need to study). Pro tip: attendance isn't mandatory, but sometimes on days when few people show up she will give a hint about an exam question. Really a brilliant lady and a very interesting course.",Renee is a great psychologist and professor. She is very enthusiastic about what she teaches and studies. She is definitely a leader in her field and is highly respected. Be grateful to learn from her. I loved this class.,"She's so cute! Her lectures are full of videos which make them very interesting.

You just can't prepare for the exams because literally the hardest thing you would have seen on campus.","The professor is a nice person but I found it extremely hard to adapt to his style of teaching. While he seems to be enjoying himself, his hand writing and vocal deliveries are difficult to follow during the lectures, which mainly contain abstract concepts and little examples.","Lectures tend to be quite confusing.

Lots of videos, so class can sometimes get a bit stale, but her bubbly personality and her general optimism will keep you coming to class. Take her class, A+++ Scholar of Excellence!!","The topic of the class was broad, and she took the liberty to make it really specific about the 60's, which is fine. I enjoyed it and liked her as a professor. Doesn't let you stay after to ask question. Takes weeks to respond to emails. Lots of extra credit on exams. She takes up a ton of time talking in circles though.","Ok, so she is a very nice and kind women. She likes to talk a lot and likes to elaborate on necessary points. If you are interested in the 1960s then this is a class for you. She seems to be stuck in the past and almost all of the material we use in class is outdated. The class is good, but I got bored and frustrated with all the outdated readings","Dr Barnett is a very insightful, caring instructor.  I appreciate the interest she takes in the work of her students--even beyond the scope of the current class.  There is a lot of reading involved and a lot of writing.  This proved useful to me in my prep for qualifying exams.","good Professor.  She has great stories about the civil rights era.  Lots of paperwork. If you don't want a class with lots of paperwork and multiple projects don't take.  Sweet old lady who teaches social justice. took soc 420 - learned alot about the 60's and 70's.  Good class.  Just do whats she says.  Don't need to buy all the books, wait","My first semester of college Doctor Barnett offered a 'discovery course' called ""Intro to the 1960s"" and it was groovy, baby! We watched a lot of documentaries covering all aspects of the decade. It was great! She is really knowledgeable and super sweet. The next semester I did an independent study with her. She's a wonderful professor!","Dr. Barnett is one of the sweetest ladies I have ever met, and has tons of interesting stories about prominent civil rights leaders she has interviewed",easy... straight to the point... please don't take this class if you are lazy because she does give you alot of readings and assignments related to the class but it is fun because you get to work in groups,Poor explanatory skills. Wastes tons of time trying to figure out technology. The computer has been in classrooms for over 15 years now and she still hasn't figured out email. Very biased politically.,"Treats you like you are 5 years old.  Syllabus is unclear and is a joke!  Exams are ridiculous, never gives a study guide.  Pathetic.... DON'T TAKE!!","Dr. Barnett was really fun to have in class. She honestly seems to care about her students and that they do well. Sometimes she will go off and talk about a certain subject in deep description and much of the class was lecture. If you find the subject interesting though, she will captivate you.","Super nice professor.  Took her for SOC 481 (the survey methods course) during the summer session and it was awesome!  We ended early everyday and only did one outside assignment, after which she cancelled the rest! :)  The major project at the end wasn't difficult, just EXTREMELY time consuming and intricate.  Would take her again.","She was a nice person but she seemed very out of touch with her students' feelings.  She referred to everyone as ""Mr. __"" or ""Ms. ___"" and insisted nonstop that we were all ""excellent A++++ scholars,"" even in cases where it was clearly not true.

Interrupts and insults student answers often. A wise man once said ""the teacher is the least important person in the classroom."" Baron needs to learn this. Hourlies are short essay exams on reading.","I went in thinking this would be an easy class and I got a D on the first exam. I almost dropped it,but after talking to him he convinced me to stay in. He was very helpful and clear and I always enjoyed his lectures. He goes over sometimes, but he's an interesting person.  I got an A in the class after a very rocky start. Ask for help if you need!","He is incredibly intelligent, and he is very clear about what he expects from you. It seems like his mind works a lot faster than his mouth, because he does talk slowly a clearly, which can make it hard to pay attention.  He's really respected in his field and he has some great stories.","I would not recommend him. This was a grammar class and I went into it with high hopes ... He lectures over the class time and slips his own personal views into his lectures. He seems to know a lot but teaches you NOTHING! Talks in monotone voice. The Class grading: 40% midterm, 50% final, and 10% participation. (Needed the book for tests only)","The class was called ""Descriptive English Grammar,"" but he taught us little about grammar aside from a brief overview. The class was almost always a group discussion on ""Standard English"" with no real conclusions. Easy class, but ugh. If you are taking him for 403, BEWARE! If he doesn't get down to specifics, drop him or else you'll learn nothing!","I had Prof. Baron two semesters in a row.  Once I learned that if you interrupt him back and give him the attitude he gives you, he'll respect you a lot more.  I had a great working relationship, and he's one of just a few professors with whom I'm still in contact after graduation.  He's the smartest man I know - I just wish he didn't know it...",Great professor. Very knowledgeable and has a lot to offer. He was really understanding and genuinely likes teaching. I would take another class with him again for sure. :),"I took his summer course and was really impressed with him. True the readings were a tad long, but the class discussions of them made the class well worth it. He is also very intelligent and has a great sense of humor.","I feel stupider for attending his class. His reading assignments are horrendously long, he ALWAYS goes over class time, and the man has yet to teach me something. I can tell he's very intelligent, but I seriously want to shoot myself in the face by the end of his class. All we ever talk about are random facts that don't pertain to the class at all.","He's a cool guy, and definitely very interesting- just don't expect to be treated with respect. This is not to say he's mean, he just doesn't seem too care much for conventional classroom manners. He'll call on a student and then immediately interrupt him to make a point of his own...things like that. A very witty individual, though.","Prof. Baron was a decent guy, but he didn't teach anything and never seemed prepared to do anything in class. We wrote a few papers, but never studied grammar at all. It was extremely disappointing- especially from the head of the department.",Dr. Baron didn't need an attendance policy: I never wanted to miss out on what he would say or do next.

I took HP with her and learned so much and actually enjoy lessons. 3 essays, 1 presentation. Easy A on the essays if you take the time to formulate good ideas. TAKE HER !!","Iryce is an amazing professor. Every class is a large discussion about the novels we've been reading. She is very passionate about the novels, and brings up such interesting points. She manages to connect all the novels to each other (especially to HP) and asks thought-provoking questions every day. Each student does a presentation on a topic.",Iryce is an awesome teacher! She teaches a Harry Potter class and it is the most fun thing. We all just geek about HP and she leads discussions with extremely thought provoking questions. I really enjoyed her teaching style and how she relates to students. Definitely would take her again!,"Iryce was a great professor! She genuinely wanted all of her students to do well and understand the material. At first, I had trouble with the paper rubrics, but after attending her office hours, I started getting high grades on the papers. The discussion is always SUPER interesting! Also, we read five to six books for the course but it's worth it!",Iryce is one of my favorite professors. She genuinely cares about her students and is the most understanding professor I ever had here. She is so funny and smart. Iryce engages students in interesting and relevant discussions. Her class is very comfortable and enjoyable. Take her any chance you get!,"I was disappointed in this professor and this class. She'll give you a mediocre grade if you disagree with her, and her essay prompts don't encourage real intellectual exploration. She expects you to parrot her. There are professors in the English department who teach similar classes in a MUCH better way. Go with one of them.","I really enjoyed this class! I think the discussions were engaging, and definitely gave me a lot to talk about in my papers. Iryce was also always available to give feedback in case you weren't sure about your paper, so it really wasn't uncommon to do very well in the course.","I can honestly say I didn't learn a thing in this class. Her ""lectures"" were glorified discussions where she asked our opinions and then didn't listen to them. Then she expects our literary analysis of these children's novels be graduate level in detail. It's just unrealistic to expect your students to know complex political issues without teaching","Iryce is enthusiastic and cares deeply about the subjects discussed in class. Her enthusiasm tends to spillover into student discussion and presentations, cutting off the speaker to add her own thoughts or to share background information. This is a positive sign of her interest but it implies she does not value, trust  or respect student input.","Iryce has by far been the best instructor I've had here at UIUC. She works to engage everybody with the material on an individual level - referencing individuals interests where applicable - and really wants to get to know her students individually. Very understanding in terms of deadlines and situations. She's hilarious, too! A++++++++++++++++++++","I love her so much. I had never taken an English class before, but she was really patient with me and helped a lot. Discussion is a huge part of class, and she encourages you to make it a book-club atmosphere. She's relaxed, and is super funny. I honestly cannot believe how little the university pays this woman, because she's incredible.","Iryce is a great professor and the lectures are amazing. You read really interesting books where it won't even feel required. She can be moody and she interrupts a lot during discussion, but she's seriously one of the best professors I've ever had. Offers rewrites on the 3 papers. No finalmidterm either.","Loved her and every class I've ever taken with her. Super interesting books, discussions, and you will learn so so much. Highly recommended!","When I didn't agree with her that Harry Potter was ALL about politics in my final paper, she told me that it wasn't debatable and if I didn't agree with her, I could've taken another class. Although she brought cookie, promised good grade and was flexible with deadline, the class was a struggle between independent thinking and indoctrination for me","Iryce is an absolutely amazing teacher. She's warm, funny, helpful, and completely brilliant. Her 442 class was by far one of my favorites at U of I and I highly recommend taking it. I learned so much that semester and had so much fun. She's the best!","She is literally the best English lecturer/teacher at UIUC. She should be a professor, but any class by her is utterly amazing.",She is too legit to quit. A+. Five billion stars.,Absolutely the best. Time for a promotion.,Best teacher I've had at UIUC yet! No clue why she's an Instructor instead of an assist. professor or professor. The department seriously needs to give this woman a promotion.,"Professor Baron is utterly and completely AWESOME. Most of the books assigned to read are very interesting. I am currently taking two of her classes at once. Discussions are always interesting and the hour passes by pretty fast.

Yes, his political views did show through, but he was welcoming of other opinions.  He was so helpful at office hours and if you just put in the required work, you'll get a good grade.  Such a huge fan!!",Barrett was a nice guy. Class was pretty difficult. Definitely have to do the reading for it (and there's alot of reading). Exams and final are all essay and you definitely need to study way in advance for them. The only thing that bothered me was that you could definitely tell what Barrett's political view was and he taught based off that view.,"He was a great professor. There's a lot of reading material and you definitely need to go through all of it if you want to get a good grade. But he knows a lot about the topic and is a great guy. You can't coast through this class, but if you go to all the lectures, pay attention, and study you should be fine.","Prof. Barrett is very into history and knows what he's talking about. Very hard class though if you are not into history. The material is interesting, but there is a lot of memorization and details to know for midterm and final. Doesn't post slides online so it helps to go to class.","Barrett is extremely intelligent and cares deeply about Illinois History. However, the midterm is very difficult and requires studying the ID terms at least one week in advance. Be prepared to memorize dates and every little detail about everything for the written exams. Other than the exams, there is one long 7 page paper.",I enjoyed this class. The instructor had a relaxed style but was very knowledgable. I learned a lot.,"Barrett is truly knowledgeable about the subject of Illinois history and is quite funny as well. There were 2 exams in this class and nothing else. Grading depends on the TA. Clear about exam instructions. Good class.

I actually looked forward to going to lecture, and I didn't mind doing most of the readings.",One of the best English professors I've ever had. Lectures are funny and full of interesting information. He adds a lot of great insight into a subject that has the potential to be very boring.,"This guy isn't as bad as the others make him out to be--yes, you *should* go to lecture, and yes, you have to study hard and do the assignments, but then, that's college for you. If you want an entertaining professor who really teaches you something rather than a breeze-through class to boost your GPA, this is for you.","He reads from a script which makes me sleepy. I am not a fan of brit lt but I give him credit for trying to make it fun and interesting. he was a jerk and scheduled the midtern for the friday before vacation on purpose. If u want an easy 209 section he is not the one, but if u like that kind of thing he's all for u.","He's kind of a nerd but he knows it, which makes him hilarious (especially when he reads in his accents).  Overall his class is difficult, but if you study you should be fine.  He is unclear as to exactly what things mean sometimes, but get a good TA and you'll get it.","barrett's lectures are impossibly fast and it's never made clear which parts are truly important (i.e. which useless facts he's going to test you on). Further, although i have no problem with swearing, i think the fact that he does it in lecture ALL THE TIME is a little disrespectful. if i can't swear in my papers, he shouldn't swear in his lecture","Prof. Barrett makes lecture interesting and funny, though with a dorky sense of humor.  The lectures are definitely very extensive but interesting (mostly) at the same time.  The TAs are all generally good too.  The midterm and final are only hard if you haven't read and/or gone to lecture. Nonetheless they're bearable... Good teacher though!","Hilarious. He makes lectures interesting and fun. The TAs that run the discussion sections are awesome. If you do your readings and take notes, you will be fine on the midterm and final. Note: Midterm was revamped Fall '07 so previous midterm comments are for a different style of exam.","Barrett is probably the hardest professor in the entire English department.  But he's also the best.  He knows his**** and he's not afraid to test you on it.  Go to lecture, read the material and you'll be fine.  But don't think you can blow off class and still get an A.  He's funny and his lectures are way less boring than they could be.","Professor Barrett is probably the best English prof I have had yet. He is incredibly knowledgable about what he teaches and really goes the extra mile to help us succeed in the course. His lecture outlines were a godsend! also: if you're taking this course, try to get into Tara Lyons' section- she is amazing!","If you go to lecture, take notes and study your butt off you will get a good grade...definately not a blow off class, but I had TA Shannon Godlove and she made things a lot easier!","I think Prof Barrett is one of the best at UIUC.  Yeah, his class was a little challenging--great!  What are we in school for if not to learn things we didn't know before?  He integrates history into his lectures, but it's history that is ubiquitous... stuff everyone should know (or hmmm... learn in college?).  If you do the reading, you're fine.","the material is dull but he tries to make it a little more interesting. He talks WAY to fast so be able to take quick notes. Midterm and Final are impossible. Funny side comments though. alright guy, bad class.","His lectures are very dense, and he talks extremely fast- so make sure to print out the notes before hand and have a cup of coffee handy. I'm sure he is a nice enough guy, but for some reason I loathed him and found every lesson agonizing. He could be amusing at times, but I was generally too frustrated with the pace of the lecture to appreciate it","tough grader... if you're not an expert on the material prepare to be lost  pretty helpful in office hours... you should go to them","I guess I'm in the minority here, but I really enjoyed Prof. Barrett's class. He did talk fast, but the lecture outline is available online before class so that helps. I thought the grading was VERY easy, the exams were not hard at all, and the paper topics were easy, as well. He was very entertaining in lecture and I enjoyed all of the readings."

Dr. Barrett is nice enough and all but this class added nothing to my preparation and I am VERY interested in general music.","Can I have the time back from when I took this course? Dr. Barrett's class was like being in the 1950s - from the jokes to the references to the content. After studying cultural competency, I was surprised to take this class, filled with ""patriotic"" folk song nonsense and no recognition of the diversity I will face in my classroom. Pretty useless."
2287824,5.0,Marsha,Barrett,1,0.7546367358551771,One of the better history professors I have taken.

EASY A!","As the commenter below me said.. that student learned about HISTORY.

I wish she taught us more about her continent as it is now and not years ago!","This was a great class. learned so much about African history, my interest now lies there because of the class.

I was concerned for her health at some points lbvs. But she knows her stuff with communications so I'd recommend her.","ECE210 is hard, but Basar's lectures help. She gives very good explanations and makes the material easier to follow.  You can attend any lecture section, I definitely recommend hers.",Really helpful and nice professor,"great professor. she explains things really, really well and is genuinely very pleasant with students. but this is not a blow-off by any means.",One of the few good teachers in UIUC.,"She talks really fast sometimes but her explanation is very2 clear..She gives a lot of examples so that students, like us, can easily understand. No other lecturer in ece 210 can match her!",good !clear,"Nice woman, and her lecture is very clear.",I make myself go to her class and sit in the front row because I'll never fall asleep.

Literally every class mostly everyone was falling asleep. This teacher does not care about her students, or making the class remotely interesting. Very dry. There were not very high expectations for the labs or the final design project. Do not take this class unless you need another class to fall asleep in.",While everything about the class and professor listed below is slightly true. This class is not very hard. The textbook is only used for five assignments. Lectures are pretty boring and so are the labs. You should get 100% on everything in this class (including the final project) and then there are two exams.  Study and you will be above average.,Masooda!!! How can we start another presentation that is at least 10 minutes long with only 1 minute left in class?!Next year can you teach the class in a different room. It's too hot! and I like to sit in 700 dollar chairs not the ones in this room. Don't You?,"Late to class many times and blames on construction on Springfield Ave. Reads off lecture slides and is surprised by the next slide that comes up (as if she didnt prepare for class. I watch more YouTube videos in this class than at home. Tests on content not covered in class or readings. Just Bad!","Want to know what senior citizens do online? Then this is the class for you! I won't ruin the surprise, but its an 11 minute youtube video you soon won't forget! Thanks Masooda!","This class is has the potential to be very informative and interesting, but is SADLY taught by an absolutely TERRIBLE professor.  Masooda will give you the toughest exams (avg for first exam=62%), read off the slides, and make you sit in an 85 degree classroom (literally). I wish they hired a better professor bc it has the potential to be great :(","Terrible experience. Most boring professor you can get. Agree with comments, all she will do is read off her terrible powerpoint presentations. Needs to take a marketing course because no college student could stay awake in her class. Labs were stupid. Tests were on little details. Very bad course, learned nothing useful.",Welcome to the worst class in your educational career. This lady reads off the slides and does nothing more. She makes you take exams in 90 degree rooms and the exams are pretty challenging. A terrible teacher plus a terrible class is grounds for a great time. Enjoy!,Literally reads off of the lecture slides.  Makes you attend class because of i-clicker points but only gives i-clicker questions half of the time. Complains about students arriving late but arrives late half the time herself.  She made the class take a test when it was 87 degrees in the room (complete opposite of human factors...).
1764357,4.8,Erin,Basinger,6,0.6661047763755933,Great lecturer!,Erin was by far my favorite T.A. at UIUC. She is hilarious and knows how to make her class worth while. I would recommend taking any class with her as her teaching style makes it enjoyable to learn the material. The way she sets up her class makes knowing what she expects crystal clear. Her rubrics are spot on and grades very fair! Would Recommend!,"So glad I got her and not one of the other TAs. Not because the others are bad, but because there is no way they could have been better. What everybody else said is right on. She's great! And she's really funny, which some people don't really get or care about, but it adds to the class a lot!","Seriously so kind, so helpful, such an amazing TA. Loved coming to discussion to get things clarified. She is always very prepared and gives such a good insight into the class. Thank you Erin!!",I thought she was great. Way more knowledgeable and helpful than the other TA for this class. Everyone in my discussion class loved her.,"Erin was not actual prof. but she was the discussion teacher. She is really cool &amp; is there to help you whenever you need . She will be the one grading your papers &amp; projects . Really fair &amp; easy grader.

Maybe a discussion on the difficulty of getting accurate results from the sample data, the process of getting data, etc.  Instead he spouts opinions and tells us to ignore other sciences like economics. Ignores the difference between correlation and causation. Waste of credit hours.","This is not a course for the disengaged student looking for a free A. It's not difficult, but you have to show up with some actual interest in the subject being taught. Bassett is full of worldly experience, and, even though he is often vague in what he wants you to know, the course is relatively easy. Show up, try to learn, and you'll be fine.","Fairly an easy class if you keep up with reading and have a basic understanding. Three map quizzes requiring you to spell/know where countries are. 3 exams that are pretty easy, part multiple choice part essay. attendance is required for first quarter for iclicker, second quarter they are extra credit points. overall not too bad, interesting topic","Somehow this man made a super-interesting subject ridiculously boring. I read the books and did the work for the TA and never payed attention to his rambling lectures (because you still had to go because he pulled pop quizzes) and I got an A+, I imagine if you do less work than that even, you could still scrape by with an A. Easy GenEd.",I cannot understand why so many reviews say this course is hard!! true his lectures arent easy to pay attention but his material is SO EASY..  Tons of Extra Credit.. and awesome ta's.. not a lot of work either..  and he tends to focus on how the west is screwing over the developing world.. Great Class! perfect GenEd!,"I highly suggest not taking this class.  I did not learn a single thing, and I didn't even know what he was talking about 90% of the time. He expects you to read like 5 novels and his lecture slides are not helpful AT ALL.","DON'T TAKE THIS CLASS IF HE IS TEACHING. Such an interesting topic is ruined by someone who clearly knows and is passionate about the subject, yet is only teaching for the research money. Despises his students and makes it miserable to attend his lectures which have six random pop quizes. Lecture slides are idiotic and completely useless.",TERRIBLE TERRIBLE professor. rambles on in lecture putting everyone to sleep and the lecture notes provide more pictures than actual information. beware.,Great class. Not nearly as hard as everyone says.  Tests require you study the notes and do the readings.  Other than that it's a breeze.  Bassett can be a little out there but it's obvious he is passionate about the subject which helps :) Worthwhile class..very eye opening,Lectures are mind-numbing. Bassett has made this class much harder than it used to be. He even screwed up the first exam and made people take it off of an overhead.,"I don't understand what everyone is complaining about. Really not very much reading, I mean, it's what you'd expect in any class.  Lectures can be boring, but interesting information.  Tests are fairly easy if you study a little and pay attention.  Great class overall. He speaks the truth...conservatives might not like it though",worst teacher I have ever had. Way too much work for a 100 level class. Very unorganized and expects students to seriously care about the material in a gen ed. don't take this class.,"There is lack of union between lecture, discussions, and reading material. This causes for under preparedness on tests that require far too much of students in a 100 level course.",if you are trying to take an easy blow off class this is not it. the coursework isnt hard but its too much work for a 100 level class,He should just move to Africa because hes useless in Champaign. Learned basically nothing except that everyone needs to help Africans (hes sooo biased). Extremely liberal and writes his test around these ideas.  I wouldn't waste my time with this weasel. Plus he makes you read more books than english classes and they SUCK!!! Don't waste your time.,Interesting but boring lectures.  Kind of hard to study for tests using his lecture notes.  Not very much an approachable guy when you have questions.  There is A LOT of reading for each week.,"I would not recommend this class to anyone unless you want to learn about how America is single handedly responsible for suppressing the third world. His lecture are extremely boring, I think I fell asleep in almost everyone. If you are really interested in the topics I guess it might be alright, but it's certainly not a blowoff  gen ed.","This class was pointless, I got a B+ just by answering everything as anti-american as possible because I knew that was what he wanted to hear.  Lectures are mostly just opinion based.","very nice guy, lectures can get slightly boring, but fair tests and fair class, very well structured","Tom Bassett is a great professor - very knowledgeable and helpful.

Attendance is ""mandatory"" but he always forgets.","He didn't follow his syllabus after he changed it mid-semester, he didn't clarify what we was expecting and he was very vague on giving assignments. He only took attendance when no one was in class and only gave quizzes when half of the class showed up. He only graded half of the assignments he assigned so it was hard to figure out what he wanted.","Brilliant mind. Highly erudite, but he needs to keep in mind that he tends to intimidate (without knowing) or piss off the dumb students. A bit absent minded. But very charismatic and even hot.","I really enjoyed this class. He lets you do the viewings at home, which was nice. It's important to do the readings, even if you just skim, because otherwise there will be quizzes. All of the class is discussion based. Three papers and a final. Says attendance is mandatory, but always forgot to take roll. Unorganized, but I learned a ton!","Terrible professor, completely unorganized and rambles all class. Rarely touched on actual class content and remained at least a week behind schedule for the entire semester. Lost assignments for many students in the class, including two of my essays, lost twice each.","Being a somewhat lenient grader doesnt make up for him being a very unorganized and awful professor. He redid our syllabus twice during the semester, and milked the excuse that he was sick for a few days. Half of class time is silent because he didnt plan what to talk about. Also didnt respect students views on film if they didn't line up with his.",I learned absolutely nothing from this professor during this class.  A sub came in one day and I was surprised that I actually learned something.  He rambles about things that have nothing to do with the class and expects us to know everything about the material.,"He is a brilliant teacher. Learned, chaismatic, and having exceptional intelligence.",Highly intelligent and extremely erudite.,Great prof!,"He is by far one of the worst professors I have had. His lectures are guided by sloppy Powerpoints, and he is apparently unable to carry on an intelligent discussion. Avoid Basu if at all possible -- honestly.",Terrible professor. Lecture is guided by shoddy Powerpoints and long-winded explanations of very basic concepts. He is arrogant and seems to care little about his students. If you have to take CINE262 (for a CINE major or minor) don't take it with Basu.,"Great, humorous teacher.",Very good professor. Not one for dumbos I guess.,"he didn't show up for the first day of class and that pretty much set the tone for the semester. i can't tell if it was the subject matter or teaching in general that disinterested him, but something definitely did because he brought abosultely no enthusiasm forth and it definitely rubbed off on the class, who either slept or didn't show up.","Oh well, tough grader, but actually a very insightful and articulate teacher. Good class.",Great. Very demanding and intellectually stimulating.,"Nice teacher, but has strange time explaining useful information"
1249655,4.4,Manisha,Basu,26,0.6895324483103599,"Great professor! Incredibly intelligent without coming off as pretentious. If you're already a strong writer, the class will come as no challenge. If you're not quite as strong of a writer yet, expect to work and be willing to consider her feedback-- she gives very thoughtful feedback on papers and writing responses.","As others have said, Manisha is a FANTASTIC professor and a brilliant person, but she is quite difficult. Grading is particular and makes a 200lvl feel at times like a more advanced class. However, her feedback is helpful and the particular nature of her grading WILL sharpen your writing skills. VERY worth it for the ""bootcamp"" quality.","A solid choice for ENGL 301, but not the easiest. Her grading was generally pretty tough. Provides great feedback on your work. Office hours were very intimidating, but she was willing to meet (and was very accessible via email). Great readings: Sherlock Holmes, Dracula, and classic fairy tales. Attendance and punctuality is very important to her.","Manisha is one of the smartest professors I have ever had. She taught me so much. She can be a tough grader, but her feedback makes you a better writer and critical thinker. Her lectures always flew by and were of top notch quality. Our selected readings were interesting and fun, too - we used Sherlock Holmes and Dracula to discuss English theory.","This class ruined my GPA. She's a brilliant lecturer, but there always seems to be a specific answer she's looking for. Every assignment is graded like a final and I don't think anyone in my class has ever gotten higher than a flat A on any assignment. I got an A or A- on everything and still got a B in the class.","Manisha is an incredible instructor. She demands a lot from her students without overworking them. Do your reading, go to class, participate in discussion. She puts you through a writing ""bootcamp"" and is very useful in helping to shape and sharpen your voice and writing skills.","I wasn't sure how well I would like this class, as I'd never been good with studying the nitty-gritty of critical theory, but she made it really interesting and more than doable.  She's respectful and patient in class, her paper comments are incredibly helpful, and I learned a ton.  I ended up doing well in the class and would take her again!",Great teacher!,"If you have a chance to take a class with Manisha, do so. Easily the smartest professor in the department and an all around engaging person. She's demanding, but you will learn so much from her lectures and discussion. Read the books though--she will know if you don't keep up. She is also beautiful which makes paying attention a lot easier","A little intimidating because she comes off so intelligent. Really have to work to get an A, but a B is extremely doable on assignments. She explains the readings very well, but you have to really pay attention. She doesn't give rubrics or much to go off of so it helps to go in and talk to her before turning in papers.","You will leave the classroom a stronger thinker and writer, that is, if you participate (crucial!). Manisha is an extraordinary educator and intellectual, and I consider her mentorship here at the university as hugely formative in my intellectual growth. A rare instructor that balances critical analysis and a tender love for stories and language.","Manisha is one of the most brilliant professors that I've ever had from within the English department. She is extremely knowledgeable about the subject material and conveys it in a manner so that students understand it. However, you will work for your grade, and you will try in her class, but you will leave her class profoundly more knowledgeable.","Great professor; really knows her stuff and provides great feedback on essays. Can be demanding and she'll make you work for it, but ultimately she's one of those professors that you want to impress and work hard for.  And she's stunning, has a great sense of humor, and has a great accent (kinda British?). Easily the sexiest professor I've ever had","TAKE THIS CLASS. Dr. Basu is one of the, if not the most, intelligent teachers I've ever had. She is so engaging and so dedicated to making sure the students understand the material, which can be quite dense.  On a superficial note--She is beautiful and has the prettiest voiceaccent, as well as being very funny.","Manisha is brilliant, engaging and very knowledgable about the material. Always had great discussions in this class. Her comments on writing assignments are also extremely helpful and will help to improve your skills. Take any class with her---you will not be disappointed!","Manisha was a great teacher, very understanding and very professional.  Don't be afraid to ask questions, she is always willing to explain difficult concepts until everyone understands.  Her grading is fair and her comments are very helpful for future writing assignments.  Definitely one of my favorite teachers so far.","She will revolutionize reading out loud for you. I loved this class. She is passionate and brilliant at what she teaches. Be prepared to talk in class. Class participation is essential because she doesn't lecture, she conducts class discussions, so you have to do the readings. But the content is interesting and she is very helpful. TAKE THIS CLASS!","Manisha is excellent. She does expect you to be prepared and will not teach what you are not willing to study ahead of time. Her class is extremely interesting and helpful. I learned a lot and although I sometimes struggled with grades, she was always fair.",Manisha expects her students to come to class well prepared- the only time she was upset in class was when no one had anything to say about the reading. Otherwise she is very fun and can answer almost any question really well. She's also flexible on how and when assignments are turned in as long as you discuss it with her. Great class.,"Incredible professor, best I've had so far. She is very intelligent and expects you to participate INTELLIGENTLY.  While meaningless blabber is always in English courses, expect less from this one. She always has interesting insights into course material even if it is initially boring.

It isn't a cake run, but it isn't extremely hard either.  A lot of reading and interpretations.   Overall I'd say the juice was worth the squeeze.","He is the best professor I have ever had.

Truly the worst professor I have had.,"This is the third online class I have taken at UIUC and I regret this one.

The tests are easy as long as you take notes, or if you know people who take notes. The TAs are very helpful and the lecture is actually fun.","GREAT CLASS!  Best professor ever!  Funny, smart, entertaining!  Highly recommended.  It's too bad he's just a visiting professor because he is awesome!","He is so in to mythology, it's adorable...and so are his bowties!  Come to lecture and take good notes and you will be fine for the exams.  Know the terms he gives before each test.  Entertaining and interesting class!",Stephen was great. He did everything he could to make lectures interesting and to get students involved. He did more than just lecture. He used movies and other readings to get the ideas across. He is a big fan of group discussions!! I would take him every semester if I could!1,best professor ever. really. he's so funny. tests are multiple choices and come straight from his lectures. dont even need to buy the text book. his t.a.'s are all very young and cool. 2 exams and 2 papers. subject is also very interesting.,good stuff! cute bowties!

The structure of his classes makes it easy to stay engaged, and the discussion is mostly student-run, which is great.",This guy is intelligent and amazing. You will regret not taking him. He is amazing. You will retain so much info.
771205,3.2,Ben,Bayer,3,0.5145581610669067,"Once you figure out exactly what he's looking for on the homework you will be able to do well on them, and the exams, which are set up like longer versions of the homework.  He gives out a ton of extra credit. So take advantage of all opportunities.",My favorite!!,"Ben is extremely pompous, and can listen to his own voice for hours on end. His students, however, are put to sleep within minutes. Class doesn't get challenging until the end, and even so, most people don't come to lecture since Ben can't seem to teach anything. Pointless class and Ben is an awful TA. Would NEVER take again if I had the choice!!!!"
244813,4.1,Kathy,Baylis,15,0.596705363429296,"Great teacher, may be a little hard to understand in class. Going to reviews and office hours is a must if you want to do well. She's very helpful and clearly knowledgeable about the subject matter that she teaches.","My first test in her class I got a D!! I was freaking out, but then I went to her office hours. She's so friendly! and she actually wants to help her students learn. She spent so much time helping me with concepts, and never acted like I was a burden. What a wonderful woman! She's so lively and kind.One of the best Econ teachers, oh, and I got an A",I did not think that she was as prepared as she could have been. She rushed through the powerpoints and for my class she did not even make the textbook mandatory. The midterms were pretty difficult and you had to really study to get and A. The info on the Midterm is mostly thru the powerpoints and u have to memorize them to do well.,"Excellent teacher, good at explaining things, very nice and helpful.  Go to class and read and study her notes and you will do well.","She is a really friendly professor who is passionate about the subject and puts students' interests and concerns into mind. She is very helpful and the TAs are wonderful. I would recommend taking this class, she was one of the best professors I've ever had since coming to this university. :)","very friendly and enthusiastic person, but she didn't teach the stats component of AGSC very well. Powerpoint notes were not laid out very well and she doesn't gives you access to the notes before class",Great prof.  Very clear and helpful.  Midterms and final were not hard at all.  Just understand her notes and read the textbook and no way you can't get an A in this course.,she really knows how to teach. Her class is fun to take.,She is the best prof I have had in Economics,she's a very great prof. fun n marks easy. notes r helpful. willing to help students on course-related stuff. the 1st gd econ prof i've ever met in ubc. but sometimes she's rushing. if she can goes a lil slower it'll be much better.,Baylis is a good professor.  You will see this if you read the textbook before class.,"It would've been very helpful if he'd used Krugman's book more.  Her lecture quite different from textbook; not always easy to understand.  Very nice &amp; wants to help, but somehow always loses/confuses me.","She's always so jittery and seems like she's always in a hurry to cover a lot of material and I just find it really hard to follow her.  The course is fine but it's so much micro, 202, stuff...","She seem very energetic and is super nice and willing to help with various questions, whether assignment- or lecture-related.  However, she goes a little t0o fast (or maybe I've just forgotten too much of the material learned in ECON 201/202;)","so far, i think her notes are REALLY helpful.. going through the ppt slides again at home really makes a big diff even if you dont get it in class right away :) nice prof~"

Best physicist I ever met.","Gordon is a great professor, and just a fantastic guy.  A bit scattered, though (which genius isn't? :)) ...Plus he was on my defense committee and asked some of the best questions.  He's one of the highlights of the Dep.'t of Physics at UIUC -- can't wait for him to get the Nobel Prize!"
2150323,4.0,Can,Bayram,1,0.609651480670934,"Can's the man. Although he sometimes go off on tangents, he gets the job done. Always does an abundance of example problems. Stays on the lecture schedule so the homework lines up with what we're learning. He has a dry sense of humor (but it's ECE, what do you expect?) that's very endearing. Zero regrets taking him."

His voice is 95% Charlie Brown's Teacher's voice. Just don't sign up for this section. Srsly.,"Absolutely the worst 210 professor ever. Avoid at all costs. Switch to another professor or just go to another session. He will often make mistakes and confuse the class. In addition, he only does questions from the text and is barely audible.","Bring a pillow, or, switch to one of the other concurrent 210 lectures. The only benefit of this guy is his lecture notes. He uploads his lectures online and those will sometimes present an easier-to-comprehend display of the course material."

He seems to answer questions in an open-ended manner and doesn't usually make class objectives clear.,No Comments,"he's pretty boring in the beginning with the powerpoint presentations, but as you go on he gets more interesting.  basically, just go overboard on the projects and it's a guaranteed A... and i even slept thru half the semester.",USELESS!
