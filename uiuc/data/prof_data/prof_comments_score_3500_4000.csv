The interaction with the students was great, that she's excited to hear our questions in class and there were interesting discussions. She's a role model to female students.",I love the examples and exercises in her class. They are the best way to illustrate concepts and engage with your classmates! At the end of our classes we were challenged to present research paper results in small groups. The experience was enriching overall.,"Her lectures are sometimes hard to understand. But I don't want to say she's not helpful, because if you go to her office hours she helps you really well.  Not an easy class.",She really do not know how to teach. Id rather go through the textbook than go to her lecture. Thats all Im saying.,Her class is difficult but if you do the work its not bad. Make sure you use the study guides as they are really helpful. Her tests are hard but its curved. Her lectures are very clear and thorough and attendance is mandatory. She's also pretty easy on the eyes.,need improvements!

I sent him an email to ask for help and he answered in details. That's a nice guy, I think","He's just awful. He puts up PDFs describing our labs and they're impossible to understand. He gives weekly quizzes which are basically impossible, the TA told me that she doesn't even understand them. After the class is done, he curves the**** out of it and everyone gets an A or B.",He is okay..,No Comments,"The class was not that bad overall. The curve was nice.

He doesn't hold your hand, he makes you put in the reps to learn the material. If someone asks him to slow down and re-explain he will accommodate. Definitely go to his lectures if you have the option at ISU.","Hal was truly a real gem to have. I had him at Iowa State and his teaching style was quick at first, but he was always entertaining and great at one on one help. His lectures are fast paced with built in examples (reps) and they teach you to think on your feet. Also very nice and caring about all his students. Truly an amazing SOC.","I struggled in his class at the beginning of the semester, but he gave me some advice that really helped me to overcome the various challenges of the course. He'll be brutally honest about your performance, but don't let deter you. He is hilarious and very engaging in class. He makes sure you know all the material and takes many questions.","I have always struggled with math until I had Hal. Calc 2 is awful for almost everyone, but this is the first math course I have actually enjoyed. He covers material a bit quickly but will always slow down and explain until everyone gets it, a really special trait in a professor teaching hundreds of students.",He's the best Calc3 Professor (I switched into his lecture). He's energetic and explain the material really well. He will also sit next to you randomly and ask you if you understand the concepts. Schenck really cares if his students are actually learning the material. That being said Calc3 is still a pain in the ass but his teaching helps.,"Exam is really hard because the exam form and style is totally different from past exams. And there are two typos on the exam and I spend almost 30 minutes on them, until they correct them. However, Hal did well on teaching.","By far the best calc prof. I've had at UIUC.  He's an amazing lecturer and although the material is difficult, Hal explains it all super well.  He's clear with what he expects you to know for tests and has a ton of  practice materials available.  He's also hilarious.","Professor Schenck is a very funny guy who can somehow make multivariable calculus interesting. His handwriting is kinda sloppy, but his teaching style is great!","He's a very engaging lecturer, and often sits with people to help them through a problem. His tests are hard but fair, and he will curve if the average is low. He's also very understanding, I had a personal situation that caused me to miss my final time slot and he was responsive and helpful. Overall he's a great professor for a pretty tough class.","Hal's an amazing lecturer who's a little bit intimidating but you'll learn to love him. He's a brilliant man who could answer any question of yours and is, not to mention, super easy on the eyes! Notorious for difficult tests but hes sweet at heart and will curve if the class is deserving. Also great at accents and will keep you laughing. Take him!","Hal is amazing when it comes to presenting the new material.  He is clear and tells you exactly what is important.  When doing practice problems, he sometimes goes a little fast which makes it hard to follow.  However, he is great at giving feedback and working with his students.",Kind of a horrible teacher.... he makes fun of everyone and then the tests are way too difficult.,"I love this professor. He is  really helpful. I ran into a problem in webassign and I emailed him. He responded me in 20 min, giving the detailed explanation! JUST LOVE HIM!!!!!!","If you have the opportunity, take this class with Schenck! His class is difficult, but it is graded fairly. He has a great sense of humor that seems to keep the class refreshing. He moves kind of fast, but he explains stuff well. I always looked forward to going to his lectures.",A GREAT professor to deal with. I tell you what: just sit in his class and listen to him. Register another section as a sub.,"I don't know what the two people below me are smoking.  There are a few things about Hal that make me hate him.  For one, he never stops yelling.  If you ask him a question, he talks to you like you are a piece of crap, every single time. Trust me. And, the final was horrible. Every single person stayed till the very end. DO NOT TAKE THIS GUY!",Incredibly helpful teacher with a good sense of humor. Enjoy his class throughout this semester. Way to go Schenck!,"Do yourself a favor and take his class. Confident and cheerful guy. Great sense of humor, and entertaining to learn from. Highly recommended.",He taeches the material pretty well but is a jerk and grades too hard on exams for little mistakes.,"Hal is everything I could ask for in a professor. His lectures are clear and he lets everyone know what he expects. He's extremely helpful. He's also about 5 cups of coffee in by the time he's teaching, so his energy is great. Exams are tough, but he gives everyone a break on the final (Make sure you reeeeally understand the exams up to that point."

She does not grade hard. If you go to class and attempt at writing the papers you will get a good grade, if not you won't because of taking attendance. I would reccomend her to anyone because she does not assign crazy papers, they are all relative and sane topics unlike some other RHET teachers",Very devoted to her class. Knowledgeable.,Everyone has to take this class so you might as well pick a good teacher. Christy was a fairly easy grader. There were four papers required for this class and not much else. A+,"Really easy class, easily passable. The poems she introduced to us were interesting and engaging, she got the class to communicate easily. Good gen ed to take, and shes a great teacher!","Did about 10% of the poetry readings, but still got a decent grade.  If not for anything else, take the class because she's pretty hot",No Comments,She is an enthusiastic teacher- always encouraging in-class discussion.

Nice enough guy though"

His preparation is outstanding and I can't help but think he's made for something bigger than teaching at a university.  He can be tough, but only when his realistic expectations aren't met.  No teacher is respected by students more than he is.","Doing grad work here at UIUC. Maestro Schleicher is wonderful to play for, demands a high level of artistry. He doesn't waste rehearsal time on stories or tangents. Orch rehearsal is a professional situation. Conducts clearly, great musical ideas and lots of experience conducting various groups (wind ensemble, symphony, etc).","Decent conductor, but the politics are a problem","great conductor and amazing teacher.  He looks a bit cold and serious, but actually he has a very warm and caring heart who  is very dedicated in teaching and music.","Although I do think he is a good conductor (others may disagree), I have a problem with the politics in the orchestra."

Lectures are amazing because he is knowledgable.,"It was a privilege to be taught by Prof. Schleife. He's very knowledgeable and therefore exceptional at explaining difficult concepts (and this is a course in condensed matter, mind you). Not too much of an ""application"" guy as he is a theorist. Quizzes are challenging, but his caring personality outweigh the bad."

He knows a lot, and he is more than qualified to teach about climate change. People that dislike him probably just aren't interested in what he is teaching bout. Overall, I've learned a lot and he's a cool guy.","I only took this class because everyone said it was an easy A.  At first it was. But for the Final, I guess the Professor got fed up with students not showing up to lecture, so the Exam will not be based off any of the exercises. This wouldn't be a problem if only he would give us enough time to copy his lecture slides! Taking ATMS 120 instead!","Lectures feel long, stuff presented is very complex and worthy of challenging a grad student (most not on exams though), and he has an air of superiority that might turn off some students.  However, he has some witty jokes and funny stories, is a world-renown professor, and the exams are, word-for-word, straight from the homework assignments.",midterm every homework question. study and you'll get an a,Those who give Schlesinger a bad score were not meant to take his class. He is a world renown climate scientist and provides very in depth evidence for climate change. If you are interested in this and the proof the class is amazing but if you are unmotivated you will get NOTHING out taking his classes.,"What everyone else said, typical class, ""ok here is a large formula for BLANK, it wont be on any tests or hw, means nothing, but i'll discuss it for forty minutes"". waste of time. and note class should be called climate change, not severe and hazardous weather because there was none.","Schlesinger loves what he does, but the class literally made zero sense to me. The assignments weren't difficult, but if you aren't a scientist, the mumbo-jumbo won't make any sense to you. Everyone I know in my class dropped before the end of the semester...should probably tell him something, eh?","very very easy. Although you can not understand what professor says in class. If you want to have a high GPA, this class is your best choice.",I agree. Biggest waste of time in the history of the world. Skip this and take Severe and Hazardous Weather instead.,"What a complete waste of my time. He obviously has passion for the topic, but had no idea how to focus the class. No point in going to lecture. Ridiculously overcomplicated,and way too detailed for a gen ed. He did give us Girl Scout cookies though, and I think he might have picked up his uber fail when about 10/60 people showed up to class daily."

Very hard for a 101 level course. Show up to every class, listen to everything she says, and write everything down. Go to review sections. Study hard. This class can be super enjoyable if you stay on top of everything!","LOVED this class! As long as you thoroughly remember and understand lecture notes as well as write down things she goes over in class, an A should be no problem. Studied for two hours each test and got an A on three out of four tests. BONUS: Get an A in the class, you don't have to take the final. Amazing professor, and made lecture interesting!","GREAT PROFESSOR! interesting class, easy A! use study guide and attend review sessions",GREAT PROFESSOR! interesting class,Not as easy as I thought it would be- you can't skip class and must be actively paying attention bc some of the material is hard and she expects you to a already know a lot of chemistry. If you have an A before the final you don't have to take it which is nice. Lecture is pretty boring even though she tries to make jokes a lot.,She knew the subject well and I learned soo much!! Such a great class. USE HER STUDY GUIDES! There WILL NOT be a test question that doesn't come from it. But go to lectures! She gives answers to the tests in class.,Awesome professor! Use the study guides to prepare for the exams,A very humorous professor! Definitely not an easy A but she makes the lectures interesting. Have to know a lot of detailed materials though,"As long as you study and do what she advises you do to (use the study guides, pay attention during lecture, do all of the activities), then you'll get an A without a problem. Dr. Schmidt is a REALLY good teacher, so you shouldn't have problems understanding the material.",She can create an enjoyable learning environment!,"This class is not as easy as everyone says it is. You still have to study for the exams, and come to class. Its not an easy A, but it's not hard either",AWESOME!! Very FUN!!,"The class is well-planned and organized. However, the guest lecturer in the middle was nervous and didn't have a lot of lecturing experience, so it was hard to pay attention after having Shelly as a professor. You definitely had to study for the tests - it's not 20 minutes as someone else said. Interesting, plus a gen ed. She's a great lecturer.",Shelly tried to make class interesting everyday. She had cool experiments too. However in the middle of the semester the class got a bit boring and was a drag. Overall though the class was really interesting and applicable and Shelly helped that out!,This class was a lot harder than I thought it would be. The first and last tests were easy but the middle two were hard. It required a lot of studying. Shelly is a good speaker and tried to make class interesting.,this class sucked and so did shelly! it is way harder than i expected and i was bored every day. if you dont need to take it dont!,Very easy A.  The class is also interesting too and has things you can apply to your daily life.  Highly recommend it to take as one of your science gen ed courses.,A very easy A just dont mess up on the 4 test and you dont have to take the final...the 4 exams are just questions taken from the lectures which you can print from online,Definetly an easy A if you do the online study guides before each test. And go to class- it counts for 100 points. Put in 20 mins studying before each test and you'll get an A (and you won't have to take the final...)

Take the class with him if you have the chance,Although I've had many technical course instructors; Professor Schmitz is very effective at relaying the information in a clear and concise fashion. The material presented is not based so much on technical ability to decipher problems so much as it is required to have a thorough foundation of the fundamentals. Professor Schmitz is a great teacher!,"Just a disclaimer, in ECE 110 you can go to any lecture, so even if you can't get Schmitz, try to make his time slot available, that's what I did. I found my actual lecturer greatly over-complicated very simple topics. Schmitz does a good job of making things easy. Do practice test, and try in Lab and an A is doable for anyone.","Schmitz himself is a nice guy and is pretty good at making things seem easy. However, this means sometimes it may seem easy to him but the class won't understand (as seen by i-clicker results). Otherwise, the class isn't too hard, just study for exams with practice exams. Lots of resources outside of class to help you.",Great professor for 110. Works through problems in class and answers questions well.,Best 110 professor there is. He is much clearer than the other lecturers and does an amazing job of helping you to actually try and understand and learn concepts rather than memorize. Use the course notes as a resource before every lecture to understand concepts even better.,Easy for any ECE freshman I would say. Sometimes you don't need to go to the lecture. As long as you read all the lecture notes and do practice problems. I also registered the honor lab section and it was awesome. The lab section could be easy or hard depends on your partner.,"Has a tendency during lectures to sort of try making some conceptsproblems seem easier by asserting they are not that hard. However, he is a very nice guy and really truly genuinely wants to see every student succeed. The amount of support available in the course is very high.",Good professor.,Prof Schmitz does a fantastic job of explaining the material. His lectures are also inspirational in that he urges and prepares you to do well in future ECE classes with little tidbits of advice he incorporates in lecture. He also stays after to answer everyone's questions.

He's always so cheerful, and he knows his stuff. He will never ever get mad. The only problem is that he has a German accent, so if you're not good with accents, he might be hard to understand. However, I had no problem with his accent.",Nils was great! He was funny and made class enjoyable.  He was good with questions and was a very good teacher!,"I was not a fan of Nils. He is European, and while his accent was relatively easy to understand, he would often have to ask us how to say a word in English. He reads straight off of a powerpoint he didn't make, and isn't exactly a brillant psycologist. That being said, class was super easy. Not hard at all, just read the study guide",No Comments

He runs off immediately after class, giving little time to get to know his students. The class itself is alright. All the work comes from the discussion sessions, with readings and quizzes. Schneider, though, is a good one but does not care for his students much.","Does very well teaching lectures and very helpful in office hour, and he is very nice Learned a lot from his UP205.",Loved the teacher helped a bunch.,"People complain he is monotone and boring, but if you actually listen he is very articulate, clear, and relates everything to real life examples. He never bored me. Lecturesnotes are mainly pictures with minimal text, so you MUST attend lecture to get information! Midterm and noncumulative final, plus a paper and easy discussion section grade.","Professor Schneider is very nice and patient.He has got not only attractive voice but neat logic to clearly explain things. He uses many vivid examples and graphs to help you understand, though these will also appear in the exams.",Dr. Schneider is a great professor who is extremely knowledgeable. His style of using real-world case studies makes class engaging. However it is important to note that to succeed in this class you have to go to every single lecture.

Also she doesn't believe and study guides for test! Other than that the only thing you have to do is outside of class is read and read documents for Friday dicussions.","This is my second time having Professor Schneider and I absolutely love her teaching style. I will admit, it is not for everyone, but provided that you actually care about your work (which I feel that those who did poorly in my class or in the negative reviews did not), you will pass easily. Be ready for a lot of work but it is totally worth it!","She's a really nice Person. She may seem intimidating, but she is always willing to help. She hates people who try to be teacher's pets. A lot of reading, but honestly, if you just go to class, you will be fine! She's not afraid to speak the truth and will allow discussions.","I took this class in fall 2017 and loved it! In comparison to some of the other reviews that semester, I never had any big issue. She is very helpful in her office hours and although the class had a confusing syllabus, it was manageable. I was a freshmen and took a 300 level course afterwards. This class prepares you for advanced classes well.","Reviews above criticized Dr. Schneider for being insensitive to those with conservative values, but I've never seen this happen in class. She is a wonderful lecturer and her personal experience growing up in Europe makes for very interesting lectures. I think she's a fantastic professor and presents multiple different political perspectives.","I really enjoyed this class. Her Syllabus was a mess but as long as you came to class it didn't really matter. You're also given 4 skips before it hurts your grade. Not a lot of clear direction but not a hard grader if you follow the page limits. Great teacher. Open discussion class, reading wasn't exactly mandatory as long as you paid attention.",Avoid this professor at all costs. She is a total mess. Her syllabus DOES NOT reflect what you will be doing in the course or what is expected of you. All assignments are extremely vague. She does not outline what she expects for papers or give out rubrics. Nor does she read drafts of papers. Very little guidance. Too much reading. Boring lectures,"She is a bit of a boring lecturer, but if you read the book and pay attention to at least half of the lecture, it's not too bad. Just keep in mind that participation actually really counts. Don't go if you're not prepared to work in in-class discussions. She is totally cool if you get the answer wrong, so don't worry about it too much.","Her lectures are fairly unorganized and don't follow her outline handout. Her grading of test essays is weird too. She's more interested in students memorizing key events/dates rather than making intuitive connections, which if you're history major is annoying. I would avoid for gen ed because its not really an easy A",She is a stickler for attendance and participation. She only does discussions of the readings and expects everyone to contribute. Her paper grading is very lenient and she provides you with a lot of worthwhile feedback.  Not a professor you can skate by and pass with good grades.,"I like Schneider. Lectures can be long sometimes, but she is flexible to discussing whatever the class is interested in. I took three of her classes and felt she was an easy grader. Just read the appropriate material for her assignments and write like a college student and you will be fine.",Schneider is a wonderful teacher! She is an excellent resource for improving writing techniques and made me even more passionate about history! She expects a lot out of her students which in fact builds a powerful educational atmosphere. You will learn a lot in her class and come away as a much stronger critical thinker!,"lectures were horrific, lasted the entire hour and twenty minutes.. and was almost verbatim what you read the night before. no actual discussion or elaboration on the the topics.. would often belittle students who answered questions with anything other than what she wanted to hear.. convinced me to change majors, so thankful for that i guess..","She had a great friendly approach and attitudes toward students. The readings are somehow demanding. Grades harsh at first and she was a good mentor to improve your writing skills. Towards the end, she give you a decent grade if you put more effort in the class.",The way she teaches is very interesting and focus on multiple aspects of US History. The exams and paper are sort of challenge because required spending more time.I learned a lot from this class. The readings are intresting as well.,"Her class is somehow demanding and necessary put much effort to have a decent grade, a lot readings, lectures are interesting, exams need lot memorization and understanding major themes and concepts, attendance is mandatory, she has a very friendly and helpful attitude to students in office hours regardless her German birth background.",A decent professor. Going to lecture and taking good notes is the only way to pass. Speak up as much as you can to get participation points. If you have a pretty decent grasp on this part of history then you'll be fine.,Dr. Schneider is very liberal and makes it known.  She always talks about how conservative presidents are to blame for all of the nations problems.  She will only cover aspects of history that highlights liberal views such as welfare.  We spend 4 days on the New Deal and 1 day on WWII.  Do not take this class if you like your conservative views.,"Does not reply to e-mails. Does not use technology. Knowledgable on subject material, but can be difficult to follow for notes. I only reccomend taking her class if you are really interested in U.S. history and have some prior knowledge, otherwise you'll have a really really hard time.",She is very good at what she does.

He's very friendly and approachable. The night before each test he stays up all night on compass to answer last minute questions. My TA (Alex) was good too &amp; the other TAs seemed good too,"As others have mentioned, he has amazing powerpoint presentations. The movie/video clips are humorous and help reinforce the concepts. Although I didn't find the class incredibly interesting, it was a generally positive experience. You don't really need to read the supplemental readings; he often covers the important points from them in class.",He's outstanding in every way.  Crystal clear powerpoint presentations make for easy note taking.  He's very funny and even more personable.  Clear that he hasn't been hiding in academia long enough to develop that off-putting sense of omniscience.  Must attend class and do the majority of the readings in order to get an A.  I highly recommend him.,Best class I have ever taken.  This class made me change my major to poli sci cuz it was so awesome.  I would highly recommend this class and prof to anyone.  You must show up to class cuz he does not pos lectures online but super interesting and he really knows how to connect with the students.  Tests are pretty easy and writing topics arent dull,Very entertaining class through his use of pop culture and video clips as examples of the terms and ideas.,"Very fun class with media-filled powerpoints.  You can probably get away with just using your class notes and pass the class.  His exams aren't bad and he stays up late the nights before the exam and answers questions for the class online. Very nice, very helpful, very interesting.  Take this class.",good class,super awesome prof! very helpful and approchable. he stays up until 3 am the day before mid terms to answer questions on forum!,"He was a great professor who taught the students a lot of interesting stuff about international law. It certainly opened up my eyes. His side project about the wine/alcohol was also really interesting and cool. All in all, a great professor with a passion for what he teaches. awesome powerpoints, and pics of his cute family.",Whoever gave this professor a bad rating must've gone to class with a raging headache everyday.  Professor Schrad's class was great in the sense that he took what could be very boring material and threw in tons of media for his powerpoint presentations to keep it interesting.  Pretty easy exams. Doesn't make his political leanings evident in class.,Excellent teacher. Funny powerpoint slides. Very intelligent.,"This is honestly the WORST PS class I've taken. Sure he's easy, but it's brutally boring. Nothing but memorizing endless, and I mean ENDLESS power point slides. And when it's all over, you will not have learned a single thing. The class discussions make your head want to explode. He lets people say really stupid things so they can have ""their turn""",Definitely a great professor. He makes class interesting with random powerpoint stuff and is definitely dedicated to helping students do well.  Very glad that i took his class.,"Really cool teacher.  Smart, funny, clear, and approachable.  His classes were always really interesting and I looked forward to attending! He makes the material come to life. His class was not EASY, but it wasn't impossible either.  His class is very fair.  Highly recommended!","Best professor I have ever had at U of I... bar none... goes the extra mile to help students and is hilarious...  If he taught it, I would take basket weaving from this professor...",good teacher,Very good teacher.  He is very approachable and makes class very interesting,He makes really good power points which are easy to take notes from and did online question and answer review sessions for our midterms/final,"Really nice guy who is eager to help students. Puts a lot of work into lecture to make it fun through humorous video clips, etc. To do well on exams, lecture is mandatory, while readings... not as much."

He really cares about students and went out of his way to make the material accessible and relevant. He explained during office hours so I understood phenomenology through my own experiences in life. Great instructor! Take him if you get a chance.,Professor Schroeder did a great job of teaching phenomenology! Lots of reading that you just have to do until you get it. If you go talk with him during office hours you will learn a lot. He really cares whether his students understand the material and will put in time to help! Great class if you want to learn about cool philosophy stuff!,"If you are not a philosophy major do not take this class. Schroeder is very intelligent and knowledgeable, but it is hard to grasp his lectures. The terminology used is also very hard to grasp. He can have an arrogant attitude towards students. Avoid this class unless you have a genuine interest in the course and philosophy.","Survey course where students are expected to know well almost every Continental philosopher from Hegel to Foucault and even beyond.  Exams are daunting for this reason, and the class seems to bite off more than it can chew in a single semester.","Very knowledgeable and insightful professor.  No homework except a ton of difficult reading.  Exams were hard but graded in the students favor.  First teach ever to explain comments on a paper.  Hard material, but a great guide through it all.",No Comments

Incredibly horrible tests as mentioned below, but 400 was easy anyway. Avoid him not because of the class, but because of his personality...",Pretty terrible. Lectures were an unorganized mess. He stumbled over himself constantly and the only thing that really kept the class alive were the TAs. Exams were really poorly written to the point where questions had to be thrown out.

I respect Dr. Schuler and her passion for genetics immensely but I, regretfully, feels that those passion are well reflected toward lectures and class.",The professor is passionate about the subject of genetics. Her lectures are boring and in PDF format. She is difficult to understand because she is very soft spoken. The class is easier to understand if you pull up the notes and follow along. The TAs are terrible. They have no teaching skills at all and just awkwardly stare at the class.,It is so so hard course. GPA risk. But if you are interested in Genetics this class is helpful to know more.,"Terrible prof and course - don't even take this if ur attendance would cure cancer. In class, Prof. Schuler lectures to herself - no one can hear her - making attendance excruciatingly painful. Exams are very hard. 30+ hours studying per exam won't cut it. Got an A, but learned nothing - def. not worth the effort. This class should be abolished.","This class is totally useless.  The professor manages to make interesting material seem EXTREMELY boring. Her lecture style is horrible, and she makes everything unnecessarily difficult. The homework policy is totally bogus, and the exams are impossible. If you HAVE to take this class, I recommend buying the book and teaching yourself...","So attendence is not really mandatory, but you will NOT do well on the exams if you don't go. Exams are EXTREMELY difficult and there aren't very many other points available to make up for it. The class was pretty easy if you can sit through the lecture, and there is a HUGE curve at the end!!","Professor Schuler does not speak loud enough in a tiny room first of all. Second, she is one of the most boring lecturers on campus. Third, she has a bogus homework policy. Last but not least, her exams are sooo hard! And you take more than the allotted time to finish the exams. Do Not take this class! Take Rivier's MCB 405 instead, way easier!","Very unfair! The class is Eukaryotic Genetics. We are learning more about bacteria than eukaryotes.  Only 2/10 HW assignments are worth points, and they are randomly chosen.  Homework takes about 2 hours to complete each week, creating a huge waste of time.  She is monotone, hates lecturing, and complains when we take too long to finish an exam.","Not very good at explaining anything. She actually makes the material harder to understand. I would recommend taking MCB 405 or whatever the one with Dr. Rivier is, cuz that one was the same material and MUCH easier.","The material isnt hard but the class is very hard.  Mary is awful at lecturing, so boring and dry.  Exams are worded terribly and are very tough.  Big curve but still not big enough to save my grade.","This class is basically a review of MCB 250, 252 and IB Genetics. You would think that would make it easy but it is god awful boring and the tests are ridiculously long and poorly worded/graded. Avoid this class if at all possible. Only redeeming quality is that it is curved since no one gets 100% on the tests",Pretty bad teacher.

She is a ditz and her class is not easy. There is no extra credit offered and the TAs are very picky when grading the papers and short answers and essays on the exams. I took this class as a blow-off gen ed and it was not easy.,"KILL ME. Thats what I thought to myself every day in lecture. This class would have been cool if it wasn't for her. She is so boring. All notes are online so there's no reason to go to lecture. It's a super easy class, if you can stay sane through it all. You'll ask yourself ""why am I learning this"" all the time. Take it with someone else.","Although class can be a little dry, she is extremely fair and a nice person.  Should be an easy A if you just go to class and keep up with the readings.","This teacher is disty and boring, worst teacher I have ever taken.  Never have I ever heard so many uhhs umms and I don't knows in one semester of my life.  Class was semi easy.",She is extrememly biased!,"She's really nice and really friendly, but she gets to be really ditsy and lost in her lectures.

Super easy going and will help you until you get the material. Loves what he does.,Great teacher!  I still talk to him on occasion.  He always takes time to answer questions before moving on to another subject.  If you have a choice take him.  He is always available during office hours and extremely willing to help.,Andy is absolutely brilliant -- by far the most inspirational professor I have had in the math department.,No Comments,"Best math professor i've ever had. Lectures were very clear and helpful, it was very easy to grasp the concepts of calc 2 thanks to his teaching. Tests were fair and reflected what we were taught. I would highly recommend taking his class if you have the chance.","Very good, and knows what he's talking about. Had him for Calc II and was one of the best math teachers I've had. He'll explain anything in his lectures if people have questions. Does a lot of examples. Quizzes are once a week, but he won't tell which day it's on so people go to discussion sections. No homework, just suggested problems in textbook."
391978,2.5,Colleen,Schultz,151,0.3342145021786646,"I'm not sure why she is an unpopular professor generally. I thought that she put exactly what she said would be on the quizzes and tests on the quizzes and tests with few surprises. She also hit us with random extra credit to inflate everyone's grades, which no one dislikes. She is good, I recommend, but there is a lot of busy work.","The class would have been fine without being required to use those awful, basic calculators. One little mistake typing into your calculator and you have to restart from the beginning! I do not even think she has office hours. Oh well, at least she is becoming better compared to her previous semesters. The final was not difficult.",The course is well distributed amongst many different aspects and hence allows the students to learn a lot of different things. Pre lectures are self explanatory and hence going to lectures is not mandatory.,"Hoo boy, literally one of the worst professors I've ever had. She does not answer ANY emails, has no office hours, and often leaves the freaking lecture early, so all 200 students in lecture have to bother the TA's who sometimes don't know the answer either. Her class is poorly run, she isn't helpful at all aside from her videos. hated this class.","Shes easily the worst professor Ive ever had. Im still getting a B, but this professor wont ever reply to emails, explain anything clearly, or use an ounce of common sense. Some assignments are due at 5am, some classes we go over one sample problem for an hour, you cant use a laptop for notes but its a stats class, etc",She's mean person and doesnt even care about teaching I think.,"worst professor ever, dont take his class.","Prof. Schultz does everything she can to make students succeed. Her flipped classroom method works great and lectures are really helpful. She will drop some grades if the class seems like they are working. The videos are very informative and exams are just like the homework. Study HARD for the Final though, it's tough","I liked Schultz, she really tried to help us good grades and rewarded us for working so hard. My advice would be STUDY FOR POP QUIZZES and STUDY FOR THE FINAL. I had a solid A+ in the class, but failed both the quiz category and the final and dropped to a B+. Overall, not a bad teacher but you gotta work for a good grade.","I was able to understand the material, but the test were pretty hard. She is not the nicest as a person. Half of the final was mostly not from the previous exams, but the last it of class and some previous exams stuff.","Material is offered on a ""you either get it, or you don't"" basis, as in the professor gives the impression of being bothered when asked to explain something differently. Questions on quizzes/tests/etc. are frequently vague or don't match the difficulty of what is presented in the lectures. She is also the only professor to give this class.","The WORST professor! 1. She is the laziest teacher. she doesn't have office hour and wouldn't return your Email. she makes classes shorter and cancel many classes! she doesn't explain much on lecture. 2. She makes the trickiest exams with the her calculator's rule and tons of steps, especially on final 3. No help, no teach, just video watch",Terrible Exams. I learned a lot in class but the exams are unnecessarily hard. It will leave you feeling dumb. She does not know how to make an exam that is representative of what she taught in class.,I'm not kidding this is the worst professor at University of Illinois and I've seen them all. She makes you use calculators from the stone age to try and trip you up every step of the way. What would take 5 minutes takes an hour with these brutal calculators. The lecture videos seem simple and then when the practice test come around you're screwed.,"One of the worst professors I had. This class is more so how to use a very basic calculator rather than actually learning economics. You'll find yourself finding the class pretty easy, but hard exams due to her strict rules.",Unnecessarily difficult. Take stat 100 instead if possible,All material learned in this class is very outdated and inefficient. She doesn't let her students use anything more than a five dollar calculator let alone excel. Don't bother going to class you'll be better off using that time to study the online lectures and HW. This class needs a curriculum change. Good Luck typing in those tedious numbers.,"Finally a professor that I learn so well from! If you don't like learning on your own then you may have a tough time, but I love how lectures are studied on your own online. Makes it so much easier for me. Clear schedule, understandable topic progression, fair homework load and tests. Do your work and you will get an A! Best class at UIUC so far!","She has a ridiculous rule about calculators that handicaps students from using technology that is readily available to them in their everyday lives for absolutely no reason. She may argue it is to help students understand what they are doing, but that is a ridiculous argument because the calculator is only as smart as the person using it....","Makes you jump through hoops and has super specific specifications for a calculator. Also doesn't lecture in class, makes you learn the material on your own, as well as homework. Lecture pretty much functions as a discussion and some people like it, but I didn't sign up for an online class."

However, the class was unorganized and there were 3 exams, 2 of which were only 3 weeks apart?! Also you have to participate to get an A in the class.

He didn't show because he couldn't get out of bed! This guy is in his 60's! So the next week he didn't show up again. By then we've officially had 4 classes and a no show for 2:4. We then got a new professor,"Hey, he might be old, but he knows his stuff. Many ppl didnt understand his lectures since they were stating theorems and definitions but if you know your math its an easy A. Also tests were very easy integrals and just knowing ur definitions.","The overall course was very difficult and the way he explained the text just confused most of the students. Made fun of his class for doing poorly on an exam. Gave few examples from problems in the book and talked mostly about the theory behind the concepts, which made little sense until discussion when students saw examples.","He had his own text which was somewhat confusing. Theorems had to be memorized word for word, but if you did that there was little to prove on exams. Homework was done in groups and was fairly difficult w/ little relation to the exams. Overall, an okay class, very complex though.","Do the homework, the exams are exactly like the homework.",He is very confusing during class. I had to learn all my stuff during my discussion class. He refuses to curve tests even after over half the class failed a test.,"Lots of theorems and theoretical methods in his lectures, you really need to go to discussion to learn how to do anything and pray you have a good TA.  Always would wait for answers on incredibly complex material from class and be upset when we don't know it, telling us that this stuff is easy.","How well you do in the class depends entirely on your TA. He knows what he's talking about, and the material isn't too bad, he just has a tendency to go into useless parallels and theorems which he tests on, but are useless.","The guy really thinks the theoretical aspects of multivariable calculus are vital to you understanding the subject material. His problem examples in class are good, and his tests are straightforward (he gives exam study guides), but he focuses way to much on theorems and the like. Success in the class depends mainly on the teaching skill of your TA","He is awful.  I absorb about 10 percent of the material he teaches in his lectures.  The tests aren't too hard, but hope you have a good TA to explain stuff.",The other section cut and pasted figures while we proved plane separation. He makes the class needlessly more complex than it needs to be.

She is positive, knowledgeable, and doesn't curveball you during exam time. My only criticism of her is that her slides can often be a bit tricky/messy to go back to when its exam-study time.

But Stephanie made the class a lot more enjoyable. Pretty easy to understand and makes lecture interesting. Easy grader!!","She was good for a TA. She let's you know exactly what you need to know on the tests, but you have to attend her study sessions. Easy class if you make an effort to get the help you need.

Prof. Seitz himself is very knowledgable and will talk about political philosophy and crack jokes alike. I adored the class and discussions; solid experience, would recommend for dedicated PS students.","Had him for 220 and 302. One of my favorite professors. Got A+s in both, having attended maybe 60% of the lectures and not cracking open the text once. I would not recommend him for 220;the tests were just guessing games that you hoped everyone did equally as bad on so the curve would save you, but def for 302,where the tests are essays-more doable",Seitz' class is what you make of it. The quizes are easily some of the strangest exams I've ever taken. If you go to every class and participate then he'll probably like you and give you a good final grade.,"Probably the worst professor I've had so far. Lectures are long, unfocused, and not reflective of what will be on the test, yet there's a grade for attendance. Tests are not too difficult as they are open book, but the questions that ar on the test will probably be a surprise. He's a nice guy to talk to but his rambling lectures are unbearable.","I wouldn't say that he is as awful as the reviews make him out to be. Material is very very interesting, but you have to really pay attention in class to get anything out of it. Book is huge but rarely used. He will sometimes call students out in class for questions that no one really knows the answer to. Overall I thought he was a nice guy",Lectures are generally confusing. All the information and understanding comes from the Internet because the book is super expensive and you don't even need to go to class except for participation points. The tests are very difficult due to questions requiring any combination of 5 options to get it correct. Thank God he's generous on curves.,"Absolutely awful. Did not teach ANYTHING about Public Policy. Decided tot each a course about political thought and psychology of voters. Covered Rational, Cognitive, and Religious thought. Don't take this class with him. Take it with a different professor.",He's rude and enjoys picking on students.  Extreme liberal bias that will make even the leftist students roll their eyes at times.  Class however is pretty easy to get an A as long as instead of studying what the book says study what he says the book says because they aren't the same thing.,Seitz isn't as terrible as some of the reviews make him out to be but I would never take a class he teaches again. The discussion was disjointed and generally revolved around Seitz asking the students a question then interrupting halfway through to correct them before they finished. The quizzes were difficult and made little sense.,"The worst teacher I have ever had. Class has nothing to do with POLS. It is like a psych class. DO NOT TAKE ANYTHING WITH HIM. He tries to trick you on the tests. Definitely, DEFINITELY avoid him",He's awesome and fun. Class is discussion based. You will learn a lot and it'll be very interesting. Everyone should take a class with Seitz! You'll enjoy it. Minimum work needed.,He is the worst professor I have ever had.  He killed my interest in public policy and I could not have disliked the class more.  I would say avoid any class with him.,"Attendance was mandatory when he decided to take role. By far the rudest professor I've ever had. Material on exams rarely covered in class, no structure, assignments were due but nobody had them done because he was so unclear about his expectations. I will never take a class with him again.","Worst teacher I have ever had. If you can avoid taking this class, please do. He is ignorant, rude, demeaning to students, and makes the course so unnecessarily confusing. He refuses to tell you what upcoming exams are going to be about except the class RIGHT before the next time you see him for the exam. He never puts grades up either. THE WORST","I have never had a worse teacher in my life. What kind of person who has the audacity to call himself a Professor, fails the entire class on assignments he NEVER assigned. No one ever knows what's going on for the exams, this class is just a group of students being objected to torture for an hour and a half. DO NOT TAKE EVER.",Condescending and inappropriate. Always gives write ups and quizzes he said he assigned but noone in the class could recall. Tests are hard and he does not prepare students properly for them. I attended class regularly and rarely did I ever relate what he was saying to test materials,"He was rude andinapprop riate. Often made comments that were suggestive,not funny just uncomfortable.Twice he took credit from the whole class for not turning in assignments that he never assigned or appeared on the syllabus.  Test prep is a joke,he gives an outline then tests material not mentioned. Does not allow anyone to question. condescending","This class can be challenging and the objectives may seem unclear at times. However, Seitz is one of the few professors who's teaching style and requirements are applicable to the world outside his classroom. Take this class! He rewards those who put in the effort and you gain an incredible understanding of public policy.","Is it easy, no. Did I put in more time than any other class, yes. Is it interesting, definitely. Do your work, put in the time, do what he suggests, and you'll really learn a lot. In retrospect, I realize how useful this class was. Go to class and office hours too. People whine about this class a lot, but I'm glad I took it.","The tests are challenging, but also very informational. He is also very generous with his curve so that helps a lot. He is a brilliant man. He has really helped me take my understanding of public policy to a whole new level. He enjoys talking with you in office hours if you go.

The experiments are fun and it makes learning easy. Highly recommend!,Amazing,"He's the best in the business, literally. Won some important award recently. He's awesome. Would take the class again even I don't get credit.","A good teacher. Some concepts are difficult to grasp, but his grading system is very forgiving. Great guy for the students and a good teacher.","Very friendly man who will play music at the start of lecture. Definitively the best 211 lecturer, especially because he brings his dog to class on exam review days. He uses demonstrations for virtually every lesson and starts the class by reading and answering student feedback.","He is SUPER helpful. I suck at physics and he's really helped me develop as a student of the practice. His videos for exams are seriously clutch. He also loves seeing people in  office hours and will talk to you like he wants to see you, not because he has to. He genuinely enjoys helping students, and his help is useful. I love this man.","Best professor I've had here, its like he actually cares about his students.","Great professor, makes physics fun and has a very easy going style.","Mats has teaching down to a science. One of the best-run classes Ive ever taken. Lectures are well-tailored to the FIP prelectures and checkpoints. His dog Bruce is adorable.

If you ever get the chance to take one of his classes, do it. You won't regret it.","He is a brilliant professor. His fundamentals are very strong and he can teach really well. Thanks to him, this course is one of the best structured courses on campus. Physics 211 is quite the experience!","Definitely my favorite professor at U of I. I regret that I didn't go to his office hours more often to get to know him better. He's just awesome, inside and out :D","Physics genius.  Tries his best to make lectures interesting with music and lots of demonstrations, but doesn't do a great job of intuitively explaining things as most professors here don't.  Also my TA sucks, which doesn't help.",Great teacher and loves teaching physics. Also has really cool physics experiments/demos to show during lecture,"Very fun teacher! However, he didn't really ""teach"" the material very much because we had to watch required pre-lectures with all the material. Lectures were interesting and sometimes helpful in understanding concepts."
750382,2.4,Michael,Selig,8,0.4212991076321496,"This professor prefers being smug over answering questions helpfully. His lectures involve him mumbling into the board, writing incoherent jumbles of figures and equations, and then erasing them before they can be copied. The material would be unlearnable without TA office hours and the book which he regurgitates instead of actually teaching.","If he would just post his notes online, there would be zero point to going to his lectures. He just blindly copies equation derivations from his notes to the board and explains nothing conceptually. Whats worse, he likes to test peoples ability to memorize all his equations instead of just providing a useful answer sheet like every other prof","Very bad. Teaches straight out the book and is very unorganized. If you have a question, he won't really help you only tell you to take a look at chapter x. Quizzes are every friday and insanely hard and he doesn't provide a complete formula sheet leaving it up to you to remember some really long equations.","1. You will learn a lot! a lot! and this is the best part about this course 2. He teaches most things out of experience, hard to find those things in books, which is good.  3. Makes you work hard! A lot of stuff is crammed into one single course and hence the lectures are fast paced. Homeworks are long. Bad handwriting, and even worse drawings.","Very effective in teaching. Tries to develop the conceptual thinking about aerodynamics instead of just solving problems. This will not be an easy class. Very homework heavy and time consuming. However, You will learn A LOT!","I'd have a beer with him, but probably not pick him as a professor. Knowledgeable, but not the best laid out lectures.",Worst class ever.

Overall she made it interesting but I wouldn't take this class again.",Professor doesn't know how to properly test students on their knowledge of the course. You put in so much work only to get to obscure questions on quizzes (which by the way cover a ton of material for about 14 questions). All of her exams are written but she stresses that it is very hard to obtain an A in this class. As a entry level Poli Sci class,"Very hard grader. Makes point to remind students how its nearly impossible to fail in her class, but also nearly impossible to get an A. Covers so much information in short given time and then tests on specific small amount.","She is very tough on students. The material itself is not hard, but she makes it difficult.

Attendance isn't mandatory, but good luck on the exams if you don't go to class. The (timed essay) exams seem terrifying at first glance, but he told us explicitly what would be on them and graded fairly. Highly recommend!","Senseney is an engaging and enthusiastic lecturer with lots of travel tips, but he dims the lights (causing sleep-deprived students to fall asleep). Exams are worth 80% of your grade--they're essay-based with monument ids (know period, exact date, etc or it's wrong) Go to lectures and skim the readings and you'll do fine. Memorize slide ids early!","Senseney is an excellent professor. He is well-organized. Course is well-planned. He is great at explaining concepts and teaching his students how to study and learn material. Very passionate about what he teaches. His lectures are long and detailed, but personal experiences and photos keep them interesting. One of the best educators I've had.","Ridiculously difficult. This was an archaeology course, not an architecture course. He assumed we were all archaeology or history students rather than architecture students interested in history. He was excited, but the class was boring. AVOID AT ALL COSTS.","Put simply, I feel like I'm taking a 400-level archaeology class as a Greek history major, and I skipped all the prerequisites. I have absolutely no idea what's going on, and I've gotten straight A's in all of my previous arch history classes. This class is a triple threat of poorly taught, uninteresting, and difficult. Avoid if you can!","THE ONLINE TESTS ARE IMPOSSIBLE. The paper is also stupidly long (12 pages) and you have to use completely irrelevant sources. Make sure you read all of the required readings, or else you will be completely out of luck. I'd take 414 with minor or 417 instead.","This class was boring (B.O.R.I.N.G.). Its called architecture history, which we do learn, but that being said it should not have ben as difficult as it was. The 12 page paper should have been more free of what we wanted to write. Instead he tells you what you have to write about and gives you sources you must use. The tests are also impossible.","THIS GUY HAS CHANGED THE FORMAT OF HIS CLASSES. what used to be working hard for a A/B has turned into fighting for a C. His online tests weve been taking in groups and getting C's. He's making us write a 12 page paper??!? He doesn't give you guidelines for the paper the class is BEYOND boring. Last year, it was a 2 page paper. Avoid taking 410/411",not very easy course but it is interesting! You really can learn a lot from his course!,"He is a very passionate person when it comes to History, which makes learning from him very easy.

He is extremely passionate about history and is always willing to share his experiences and knowledge with students. There's nothing tricky about the class, just pay attention in class and study.","Great professor, very knowledgeable and passionate about material, which also means a bit difficult. he does not believe in taking attendance but you need to go to class, take notes, and study material weekly. his grading on our exams used a generous system that gave you the edge but still found the class difficult for a history class","Go to class, take notes, and follow his very specific guidelines for the 3 papers. His class is interesting and he gives lots of travel tips. The final exam was made up of all old quiz questions. (And the quizzes were stuff you wouldn't miss if you listen in class)","A very passionate speaker!  Made me think about architecture in ways I never had before.  As long as you do most of the readings and memorize the vocab for quizzes, this class will be super easy.  No papers, and the tests are pretty basic.  A fun guy overall!","Has a true passion for the areas he teaches, but the class requires more effort than can be afforded for architecture majors who are trying to balance a studio class on top of it.",SUPER AZOME!,He was interesting to listen to but some days he put me to sleep.  he has a strong passion for the material.  I was not a fan of his grading.  He was not always clear on why he took points off.,"Intense interest in subject. He often goes on tangents, but they don't detract too much from the topic. I have found that his fervor is quite contagious. A great professor"

Towards the end of the semester, I continued to think ""I don't know how many more of this professor's lectures my grade can sustain."" It seemed like each lecture was just a survival attempt for my grade. The other professor did a good job, but this professor rambled and flew through his ppts.","I strongly disliked this professor. He abused his right to use power points, lectured too quickly to take notes, does not put his slides up before lectures, and generally completely lacked interest in his students. In general, he came off as lazy and uninterested, and if we had had a more concise textbook, I never would have gone to lecture.","He and the other professor for the class were both incredible lecturers.

Have to work at it but she is a great professor.","She is the reason I am an Accy major. I learned so much and really enjoyed the class. She realizes her material is not the most riveting and engaging material so she makes jokes about it. She is a clear lecturer and if you study the notes, skim the book, go to class, and do the green sheets, you will do well.",Awesome professor! She is so cool :),"I've never had a teacher with a more organized lesson plan. Her textbook with PowerPoint slides and practice exams is very thorough and basically everything you need to pass her tests. Her exams are exactly what is taught in her class, no trick questions. I got Bs on the exams and the final, but she curves the class fairly well.","Nice person, bad teacher. Her exams and final were unreasonably hard. Homeworks and projects were pretty easy, but she did not prepare us for what she tested us on. Pulled off a good grade in the class, but I don't feel like I learned the material.","Very organized, get's to the point, no fluff. Very fair grader of projects and HW, unlike Curtis in 201. Very smart, knows her stuff.","Worst professor I've ever had. Boring teaching style and useless words I the package.. She has never used the reading book, and the course package has a bunch of useless words in it.",Overall easy A. I received 102% until the final exam. Final was brutal. So do well during the semester and get as much easy point as possible.
572371,2.5,Pat,Shapley,42,0.411188154889781,She is nice,She is an insane hippie with a terrible fashion sense and student-eating mane. She may say one thing while her powerpoint slide says another. You don't use a textbook and you die from boredom or her hair. She encouraged students to drop. She can't teach and she needs to be disciplined. She needs to respect her students.,"If you want a better chance at an A, sure she's a great teacher.  If you want to learn Chemistry, run as fast as you can.  I fortunately only had to take one semester of Chem, but many people I know took her again only because they were scared to take anyone else.  Her topics are rather haphazard and very different from what other teachers teach.","Shapley focuses entirely on organic chemistry. Every example is an organic example. She also doesn't follow the same general curriculum as the other professors, so good luck with labs. I would switch at all costs if I were you.","She is a fantastic teacher and one of the main reasons I like chemistry now. You have to do a lot of work, but the consistent work makes the exams almost easy. Although she doesn't give much partial credit on exams and quizzes, the homework really helps your grade out because you get points just for doing it. My favorite teacher!",Unclear with her expectations. Exams do not reflect the content reviewed in class.,"I actually enjoyed chemistry before this course. She doesn't teach or explain, same goes for the TAs. Office hours were useless as well. Switch to another professor if you can; otherwise, good luck.",The tests and quizs are horrible. The grading policy is weird. She is a nice person but not a nice teacher.,"I really do not appreciate her grouping style. If you get a bad seat on the first lecture, you will have a large chance of staying there forever. I nearly lost my interest in chem because of her.",More than half the information given is useless nd does not appear on any tests or quizzes. Your grade depends on your group mates b/c they will be helping you more than then her. She is a nice lady but the class sucks does not prepare u well either. Class is only good if you dont care about learning and just tryin to get a chem credit out the way,This professor is horrible. She has one of the worst systems i have ever seen for her class grading and her teaching is atrocious. Her lectures are essentially the online lecture with little to no explanation of what was learned. Also her test forms on quizzes and exams all vary in difficulty meaning form A may be noticeably harder than form B.,"Absolutely would NOT recommend to anyone who wants to succeed. There's so much I could say, but my biggest complaint is that she is completely unpredictable in her testing and teaching. It's very difficult to know what exactly to study and what actually matters. If you're stuck with her, good luck.","She's a nice person, but not a good teacher. You're on your own through the entire course and left to learn things from the textbook or the online web notes. First day of class she had us get into groups and let us know AFTERWARD that these people would be our group for the rest of the year and our grades would depend on them.","I'm glad I don't need to take any more chemistry classes because I would be completely unprepared. The class did not cover many of the topics discussed by other professors of chem 104 and it often left me confused in lab because there was very little correlation. I got an A- in the class, but if you want to learn something pick a different prof.","Difficult to grasp concepts since you have to learn them yourself or go to office hours, but she's very enthusiastic and presents the information in a way (through topics/applications) that i found very interesting to learn about","This class is definitely not for everyone.  She expects you to learn the material on your own and only briefly covers basic concepts during the first ten minutes of class.  Homework, tests, and quizzes are tricky and go WAYY more in depth than ever covered in class.  Don't take this class unless you like group work.","DOES NOT FOLLOW CHEM LAB 105. I got an A in lab and C+ in her class. You relearn all the material in three units. She claims that you will learn it better each time around, but she just expects us to know it the second time. She does not teach the material in her class. We only do worksheets. Her Chem 104 final was harder than all other tests.","For those who complained about attendance... you ARE at school to be in class and learn so that's just silly. You get the most out of any class by being there. Shapley did indeed focus a lot on organic chemistry, but that's very important--especially for those who are moving on to that course. Office hours help a ton! She wants us to succeed!","I loved her style of teaching but it isn't for everyone. You do work in groups and for the most part the class is very interactive so if that's not your thing I would recommend another professor. She is VERY helpful at office hours so if you put in a little more effort she is great. Yeah the class is hard, but she is so helpful if you ask!",You have to go to class and do stupid classwork in groups. We had ASSIGNED SEATING! She doesn't teach what's actually on the test. We just went over seemingly random things. Don't take a class with Shapley!
1633568,1.2,John,Shapley,2,0.20993315708539798,This was the worst class I have ever taken in my whole life. Worse than Calc 2 &amp; 3 and Orgo 1 &amp; 2. You just read lectures and he doesn't teach you in class and gives you worksheets that he expects you to be able to do without any clarification as to what you supposedly learned. He's sarcastic when you ask questions as if you're dumb for asking,DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS! I took this to finish my chemistry minor and I have never taken a worse class at this university. The material is interesting but the teaching (if you could even call it that...) is horrendous. You are expected to remember EVERYTHING from general chemistry and this class is solely based upon you teaching yourself.

If it is not on the study guide, it will not be on the exam. Exams are fair. Term paper due at the end but it is not bad at all. 3 exams.","Such a great teacher, very easy. Grades everything by completion, highly recommend her.",Awesome class and teacher.,"sooo easy, and such a cool chick. really interested in your success as a student, and definitely concerned about your grade. if you show that you have interest in the class and put forth the slightest bit of effort, you can get an A. there's a lot of busy work but that's unavoidable due to curriculum. best option for a CMN 111 teacher",The class required a lot of work but the grading was very fair and the teacher does a good job of explaining everything she expects from the students on the assignments.

When you first meet her you might think she's strict, but she's super nice and easy to talk to. She was always willing to help the students out, and I would highly recommend BADM 323 with her!","Easy exams, but way too vague when it comes to the plansbooks. They take too much time and effort for her to be vague and then take points off for her own lack of clarity. Shavitt is not at all as interactive and energetic as the class needs (and deserves). Wait to take it with Tiffany White, if possible. I've heard she's MUCH better.","Would never take a course with this professor. Loads of unnecessary work, not friendly or polite.  Have never used this information outside of class.",Very selfish person,"Exams were very easy, but plansbooks were made more difficult than need be. She wants everything to be explained to the most minute detail and if not, draft grades will show for it. Her grade scale does not account for +/- so be aware of this throughout the semester."

The grading criteria, writing amount, and his expectations are easily obtainable if you attend class; not hard. Professor Shea cares about his students and is always open for office hours. Take him","Does not make grading criteria clear. His expectations are too high for an intro to ethics class for non majors. The writing amount is ridiculous for not being an advanced comp.

The lectures and powerpoints are dense and there are no study guides for the exams. However, you use the DSM for part of the exams and there are case studies and a presentation that makes it easier to get an A.","There's a lot of reading, but the hands-on involvement in the Family Therapy course is excellent. Tim is hilarious, caring, and knowledgeable. He shares his practice experience and truly promotes learning and self-improvement.","I loved Tim's class, he is funny, knowledgable, and will answer any questions you have about material. I didn't mind the group projects, he has you do 3 case studies in groups of 4 people that you choose yourself. His class wasn't easy by any means but it was informative and straight to the point when it comes to grading expectations.","You better like group projects!!!!! We had three through the semester and it was a nightmare, no joke. There is always some slacker in the group that make the whole thing wish you never took the class in the first place.

He really likes to know his class at a personal level, and knew everyone's name within about four classes. We read some great plays, and it was an excellent class. Grades very nicely, too.","Really nice, easy-going, incredibly well-spoken and knowledgeable. You'll get the most out of the class if you participate because it's heavily discussion based, but he does a great job of leading discussions.  He can be a hard grader but he's more than willing to meet with students one-on-one and address any issues or confusion.","He is very passionate about poetry, so he talks a LOT but the workload is pretty light and the class was usually interesting. He is nice and will give extensions if you need them and ask in advance.","Funny and charming, but harsh on formatting......be sure to have everything MLA-ed or ur screwed!!","Love him! Make sure you know who authors are! He always asks this on quizzes. It's best if you attend every class because you never know when he'll throw in a pop quiz!

Highly recommend","Really really nice guy, very helpful and does everything he possibly can to help you understand the material. Sometimes the material is challenging but just study, do practice problems regularly and approach Naeem if you are having any trouble so that he can help you.","Tries hard, but ends up mystifying not just me but most of the other students in class. Has this way of lapsing into doublespeak that's very irritating. Linguistically challenged, he may be better off teaching in his native language.","Naeem is a nice guy but he often fails to make concepts such as vector spaces clear enough. Also, some class periods were incredibly boring and tedious to sit through. The homework is quite challenging, and the tests are fairly hard. Thorough studying is a must. Going to class is not enforced, but you absolutely HAVE to go in order to get the notes","Naeem does a great job teaching a difficult subject.  If the students don't understand a particular concept, he goes over it multiple times until it makes sense.  You will only use the book once or twice, unless you want to try practice problems.  Go to lecture, copy the notes, understand the notes, work with friends on homework.  You'll be fine.","There's no point in going to lecture as long as you get the notes from someone reliable.  I hardly used the book.  Homework is hard, so go to tutoring/office hours, they're REALLY helpful.  He's also really fair when it comes to arguing exam/hw grades.  Exams are hard too but study your notes/hw/past exams and you'll do fine.","I thought this class was kinda hard, but he did an excellent job covering the material. If you go to class every time and take notes, you'll be fine.","The class is really hard. He on the other hand is an awesome teacher. You will still have to work really hard though, and probably still end up with a bad grade. It just comes with the class. Just don't blame him for it. Blame the College of Business for making you take it.",Excellent teacher.,"He writes out all his notes badly, without explaining. When homework is given, the smallest mistakes can cost you major points",Tough class...but he will do everything he can to help you and properly teach you the material.

Tests can be a bit tricky as mentioned, but Naeem will do all he can to help you out.",Naeem is an excellent teacher and very helpful. His lectures were good and had flexible office hours. His tests were a bit tricky and kind of hard but he was lenient in grading.   I highly recommend him.,"Very Patient, good professor, pretty easy too.","Good professor, very helpful and patient.",No Comments,never returns homework or quizes.  We have a homework due every week and he hasn't give us back the last 3 weeks worth even tho our test is tomorrow.,"Very organized &amp; kind.

As long as you do the readings/study &amp; follow directions you'll be fine.","No words can describe how helpful and inspirational Peter is. He loves the creative industry and it shows. His advanced creative class is grueling. It's tough and it will break you down at times. However, it is definitely the most rewarding class I've taken so far in college and Peter only pushes you to be the best you possibly can.","Peter was a great professor. He is lively and extremely engaging. His life is very interesting and he is very helpful outside of the classroom with career advice. His class is easy if you study and do the work. Make sure you do all the readings and go to every lecture. Take good notes on both and you will get an A. Also, put time into assignments.","2 midterms and 1 cumulative final, easy to fail if your not paying attention in class and don't do the readings. Nothing is posted online, he expects you to take notes. Gives EC in lectures and is particular about group projects (3 proj total) Drops your lowest test/project grade. overall enjoy the lectures and gives a lot of good examples of ads.","As an ADV Major following the more creative side, this class was perfect for me. The lectures were intuitive and interesting. Peter is thoughtful with his assignments and creates a well structured class. You immediately can tell he is a seasoned and well versed Advertiser that genuinely wants to share his knowledge with his students.",Peter is a very harsh grader. He tended to talk about himself a lot during lecture. He often let us out early which was nice. We used the text books a lot. Examples from the text made up half of the questions from the exam. Beware of the two group assignments. You must attend lecture to get notes for the test.,"Really cool guy. Class was hard, but I learned a lot. He grades harshly on group projects, and you should stay on top of readings for tests. Be sure you know you get a good group for your assignments that is as into it as you are... I think that's what killed my assignment grades.","Fun to listen to, very cool.","Peter is a GREAT resource! He knows everything about the industry. But he grades HARSH, to the extent where the deductions seem petty. The course is set up well. I ended with a B+ higher than the class average, due to my success on the exams. I studied an entire week and passed with A's. But I struggled on assignments. Beware of the assignments!",Peter will tell you almost everything about this industry. He's really passionate about what he's teaching and he response your email extremely fast. He is a tough grader but you get the grades you deserve. Really love him.,"Sheldon is easily the best professor in the Advertising department. He grades like he tells you he will grade, and gives you adequate preparation for the exams. For the group project, make sure you know 2 people, because it's worth 200 out of 500 points and you need a good group. 450 is an awesome course, and you'll learn a lot.",He is absolutely an excellent lecturer but he is also a very mean grader at the same time.,"If you're an ADV major and don't take this class you're missing out on SO MUCH valuable information. It's my favorite class I've ever taken, However definitely not an easy A or even an easy B. I studied 12+ hours for the first exam and got a C. Make sure you do all the readings, half of the test is from them.","If you're looking to work at an adv agency, Peter is the best professor you will find.  He will either tell you or assign readings that tell you everything you'd need to know about agency culture.  His class is fun, interesting, and prepares you to create work you can put in your portfolio to get a job. I'd take this class over if it were allowed","This class is one of the best I've taken. I don't look at ads the same way anymore. I feel like he prepared us very well for internships, other classes, and jobs in the future. He knows so much about the industry and is very passionate about it! Lectures aren't mandatory, but I always go because he's so interesting!","Sheldon is great. He loves what he teaches and he (seems to) love to teach. He always has a smile on his face; excellent professor. The class is not easy though. You will have to think and really apply yourself, but the class is fun.","He'd make a good mentor, but not a good professor. His tests were beyond picky for an easy material and his project grading was extremely unfair. Directions for the projects were unclear, because points were taken off even if we followed everything. His classes are interesting but it's not worth the GPA drop.","Peter is my favorite teacher at the university! I recommend taking every class that he teaches. He is so nice and actually teaches us practical and useful things. His creative classes are so much fun, a lot of work, but fun work.  He makes the classroom a very relaxed atmosphere, its really great.","Best professor on campus, hands down. If you're an advertising major, and don't take this class, you're dumb.  he's the first professor who actually lays out the structure of an agency.  GREAT PREP for the REAL WORLD!! loved his class!","Great teacher, knows what he is talking about. Fun class, great lecturer. Attendance is taken 6 random times, but are easy points.

I thoroughly enjoyed his class. He is concise, consistent and absolutely clear on everything he expects. Would highly recommend this professor. I have learned a great deal from him.","Seems like a nice guy if you got to know him, but his attendance policy made me skip class. Asks questions on previous readings and if you don't get them right, you lose points for participation - in front of the whole class.

Learning from the book it wasn't too terribly difficult material but the professor was just so vague about what was included on tests and how to prepare and reach success in the course","Disappointed that the business department has this professor teaching all of the business minor students,a disservice to them. This class was 1 lecture a week and the rest online videos. Word of advice, I found the textbook the most useful resource. Silhan voice is difficult to understand and spends little time teaching for a 80 minute lecture.","Unfortunately, this man is the only professor for Accy 200 (a mandatory class for BUS minor students). Silhan is an ineffective teacher in the fact that his lectures are meaningless and has a panic attack if someone sits the wrong way during a test. Don't let him make you dislike ACCY just because of his poor teaching methods","Actually the worst instructor ever. First he cuts down on meetings per week from 2 to 1, because he wanted to do a ""blended"" online and in-person class, which is fine. Lecture's supposed to be 1.25 hours. He's supposed to teach, then give a quiz for EC. He babbles for about 15 minutes, if that, gives the quiz, and we're done with lecture.","The worst, most ineffective teacher I have ever had in college. Material is not difficult, but he doesn't know how to teach, how to write a quiz, or how to guide you to success. Save yourself the frustration and take the class with someone else.","He's disorganized and not a very effective teacher, the grade boundaries are generous though. Regularly studying for the quizzes would make sure you're prepared for the exams (quizzes and exams differ vastly though) I did learn the basics of accy though this being my first accy class (part of biz minor) but wouldn't wanna be taught by him again :/","Silhan does not know how to teach, and his course is relatively useless; I got a 94, 75, and 56 on the exams in that order; going to office hours is really helpful, much easier to learn from the TA's than Silhan. Overall, with the extra credit, it should be easy to get a B without trying too terribly hard.",The problem is this class is useless.  I really learned nothing about Accy and wasn't interested in doing so.  Not much work... and i think that's why i didn't do well.  No review. review sessions are a joke.  It's a useless class.  Just make sure to go to lecture and read though and you should be able to get a b or better,"This man is smart. However, his ability to teach what he knows is minimal at best. He teaches a certain way to let you learn the quizzes, but the exams have nothing to do with it. They are all over general information instead of specifics. Since this is 85 percent of your grade, very difficult go do well.","Not terrible, but not fun by any means. He can be entertaining. Little tough on quizzes and tests, but come to class, get extra credit, and you should be ok."

She forgets to record her own voice but that doesn't affect my performance.","I wouldn't give her a high grade because she turns off the volume of recording intentionally to force students to take her class. Besides that, the rest is fine.","This class is a ton of lin alg later on, so be prepared for that. She's a good lecturer, so if you pay attention you should be fine. All lectures are also posted online which was super useful. Very steady workload, weekly homework and a CBTF quiz every 2 weeks. ALL other practice material is in the textbook, so get it if you think you'll need it.",Love that course materials are available online. Great lecture notes and explanation of difficult material.,"Mariana (Silva) Sohn's last semester teaching TAM 251 :(, she has moved to CS so you'd better register for CS 357 next sem if you want to be taught by her! Best teacher ever!","Prof. Silva is the BEST I've had in Chambana. A pleasure in lecture and office hours, cares about students, answers emails (quickly), and fantastic lecture presence. Highly recommended!","I wouldn't say Silva is a great professor, but she makes it very easy to get a good grade. Quizzes are directly from the homework and the final is simple if you generally understand the concepts. At the end of the day, as long as you understand how to do each homework question this class should be an easy A.","Great teacher. Class isn't too difficult, although at times the online quizzes (taken at a testing center) can catch you off guard.","The lectures are easy to follow and she feels approachable as a person. The volume of homework seemed a little high, but don't let that keep you away from her classes.","Very well explained material.  If you stay on top of the homework and go to lectures, it isn't hard to get a high A.  Make sure you understand early topics since the material builds upon itself.",There is a lot of homework for 20% of the final grade,"She's so friendly. You can tell she genuinely cares about the success of her students. Lectures were easy to follow and helped a lot with understanding. Plus, she records them and uploaded them online which is INSANELY helpful, especially around finals season. Highly recommended.","Best Professor I've seen in U of I. Amazing lectures offered, and very clear explanation. Dr. Silva is always open for students.  I took her TAM 211 for my first semester as a freshman in college. I get an A+ and end up with 102%. I am sure if you take her class, work hard and go to office hour often, you will perform as good as I did.","Dr. Silva is a great professor - very clear and structured lectures, fair exams (she gives major hints on exam content).","One of my best professors so far. Her presentation of the material is very clear   I highly recommend her. Also, some advice: attend all review sessions. The example problems are almost identical to the ones on the exams.",Awesome professor! She makes everything understandable and tells you exactly what's going to be on the midterms.

That's a lot of work. very rude to me becuz I asked her if she posted ppt online and she suggested me to drop it. said something hurt to me when I was trapped in mental illness, then I drop it.",She doesn't post anything online so you have to show up in order to get the information on the test. She does a lot of video clips/movies that you should be there for. She's really passionate about her lectures.,"Very passionate. Has specific lecture rules and is crucial that you follow them- unless you want to be called out. Class is fully lecture based. If you ditch and don't have a reliable source for notes, it will be tough to do well on the 3 exams. The syllabus is a good way to study.","The class isn't too difficult, but you have to attend lectures. Silverman won't post much online, and also doesn't allow any technology in her lectures (you have to take handwritten notes, no recording the lectures, etc.) She is very passionate about the subject, and she is an expert on Peru so many lectures will include Peru.",Easy if you really pay attention. I didn't but wish i did. only have 3 exam all semester and they equal 100 points.,"You absolutely need to go to class, there is no textbook, no slides, just the notes you wrote down and the syllabus. Overall, it was an easy class you just need to go to class and pay attention. The professor is really kind and the tests are straightforward, there are no quizzes, required readings, or papers. Pay attention and you will pass.","I loved this class, however the clarity &amp; order of some of the lectures could've been better. I'd google things sometimes. No textbook, so there's a lot of individual readings. Was disappointed by lack of coverage on some subjects. I don't mind her syllabus rule, or not posting slides, just read it &amp; have a friend to text when you're sick.","Class was just 3 midterms pretty easy. A few questions were very difficult but I got an A with 87 in the class so not too bad. Lots of memorization. Don't talk in class, professor Silverman is a sweet lady she doesn't deserve that and also she'll kick you out and embarrass you in front of the whole lecture hall","You're sitting there thinking, ""I need an easy A next semester. Should I take Anth 180?"" Yes. Be prepared to go to class and take notes no matter how simple her lectures sound. Her class revolves around three exams which add up to 100, so every question wrong is a point off your grade. A friend I knew did not take notes and got a C. Avg. 86/100 (B)","Professor Silverman is my favorite professor I've come across so far at UIUC. ANTH 180 is fascinating due to her personal experience as an Anthropologist. If you go to class, take notes, and stay in tune during the lectures then you'll do great. Questions on the exams are very fair and are only over things we've covered in class.","She's really not bad. Just be polite, read the syllabus, go to class, and study your notes before exams for a relatively easy A. Silverman is very well-spoken and often thrilled about the things she teaches. She's technologically challenged, and there's something a little odd about her, but class was often amusing and interesting.","Helaine is a typical grandma. Sweet if you follow her rules but not scared to call you out. The topics she discuss are pretty interesting. To pass you NEED to go to lectures and take notes, she only gives 3 exams and all the info can be found on the syllabus and in lecture. She is actually really nice, just doesn't like dealing with dumb questions","Just don't. I'm an integrative biology major and I'm pretty sure I did better in organic chemistry than I did in this class, even though I was interested in the subject. It was 100% exam based and asked completely trivial questions (such as, ""where was Mr. Appleby buried?"") that you may or may not remember even if you attended every class.","The tests are mostly easy except each test are about 10% impossible. She tells you that shes not interested in minutiae, but then asks you what the name of an author of a book that you never read is. There is no good way to get an A. She also deducts points if you ask her any question she thinks is answered on her syllabus, so don't bother. Boring",Funny and interesting,"If you go to class and take notes, read the syllabus, not necessarily do the work on it you will get a good grade. Class can be interesting, but sometimes its hard to stay awake. She talks VEEERY slow. Lots of reading but you can get by skimming or just looking at the sylabus.",She does not post any material online or available to you so if you miss lecture you're screwed. Not a good professor in terms of getting grades.,The assignments and exams are only a few projects in the class that are extremely fun. We had to make up a museum exhibit that we would make and it was a lot of fun. There was one group project that was not bad at all. Overall great class.,"If you want a class that you don't have to go to, don't take it.  Your grade is based entirely on your tests, which total to about 100 questions, each one worth at least 1 point/1% of your grade.  The entire class is ridiculously trivial, so if you missed stuff or didn't go you're seriously screwed.  Didn't learn much.","Nice enough as a person, but the class was ridiculously easy. I had sent her several Onion articles that related to the topics at hand, and on the last week of class she said something that showed that she had thought they were all real."

Care about this class, it cares abt u","Interesting course, but he assigned lots of reading, which takes too much time.",Do not even think about taking this as a blow of class. There is a listening section where you have to identify form and the time period of a piece. Class is very broad and he provides little help in means of narrowing your study focus.  Few easy points too as the exams make up the majority of the points.,"He keeps his lectures really interesting. Often times he will bring in guest lecturers and has class activities.

No exams, just 7 papers, 5 of which were mandatory. Graded harshly for a non writing course, and was not a good teacher. Gave me my lowest grade of the semester for the lowest ranking class of my semesters.","This man is a ridiculous excuse for an English teacher.  His class discussions are shallow at best.  The class does more actual analysis of texts than he does.  He makes a blanket statement, which he retracts ten seconds later.  He doesn't remember characters and important details from the novels.  He should still be in school.",Worst teacher ever! Tried to fail me until I went over his head to the English director!!! Luckily I did that! During the course he was a really good teacher until he tried screwing me over.,"I got a B+ in his class, attendence is crucial. He gives quizes, 3 tests, a poetry paper and a short story analysis paper. Be prepared to come up with inventive ways to look at texts. not too much reading. Weekly postings online.

The lowest grade I got on a paper was a B+, but you need to put effort into the assignments. He's full of energy and loves talking about films, and encourages you to approach him. If you pay attention in class, do the readings, and go to the lab, you'll do fine.","I was terrified to take this class after reading reviews but I'm glad I did. He is passionate, very clear, few papers for homework and rarely refers to book, and xams are straightforward. HOWEVER, he is rude via email, rarely lets discussion out on time, and goes off on tangents. Take this class if you have him for discussion/dont take if online.","Obviously when someone comments ""tough, but fair"" is totally written by the professor himself....because simply he really just sucks... he has no respect for students,(if he did, i wouldn't say he suck),  not responsible NOT FAIR because he is not helpful, and who writes tough but fair?!  Overall, it is just a frustrating class. Hopes he improve.","He is so bad... Never answer your question clearly. Minor mistake may cause much deduction in this class. He teaches business writing and tells you to write politely, however himself never did that...","In order to get an A in this class, do not let this teacher be short in his emails/ comments. Whether an online course or not, find a way to have him look over your drafts! Ask SPECIFIC questions, never assume. Spend at least 10+ hours on assignments in order to perform well and use terms from the textbook. Note that the final is worth 900+ pts."
1353164,4.2,Irene,Small,3,0.8010812242983255,"She is enthusiastic about what she is teaching, which what I loved most about this course. She is clear with the subject matter. I truly enjoyed this class.","Interesting class but VERY challenging. Pretty difficult to get an ""A"" on anything. Very knowledgeable in her field but seems to let her personal views toward artists/works factor into grades. NOT a blow-off class.",Excellent Professor!  Her lectures were diligently prepared and always brilliant.  No matter your level of knowledge of art I would recommend a class with Prof. Small.  One of the best on campus!
1016867,4.5,Rachel,Smallman,3,0.6522347525257586,"Great teacher, quizs online, 1 page written assignment were easy, drops the 3 lowest quizs and written assignment (there is 8 total of each) Midterm and final were hard but great teacher!",She's Amazing!! Great Teacher!!!,"Comes to class prepared and often uses slides and videos to teach concepts. Enthusiasm level is good. Addresses questions directly and is eager to help. Class was both interesting and easy. Grading system is not tough, there is not a lot of work in this class."
2183148,2.9,Krystal,Smalls,15,0.4017017674751796,"She gets through a slide or two a day because of how much student participation she allows (which usually isn't necessary). She announces when there's going to be a pop quiz but throws them in randomly. I stopped doing the readings early on, and she only brought it up a few times. I survived. The project at the end isn't hard--just a lot of work.","Her notebook quizzes and actual midterms get insanely specific, such to the point you had to name a specific linguist mentioned one time on a specific day. There are also very few quizzes and tests, so they are weighted kind of heavily. However, she is a very nice person, and in a smaller setting was more understanding of missing days.","Dr Smalls was a great professor! I took the online Anth103 version and she was accommodating, professional, and smart. Be prepared to do actual work, but everything I did for this class was super interesting. I'm an MCB major and took this class with Orgo and Genetics, and still passed with an A+. It is 100% doable and worth taking.",Took an online course and Dr. Smalls was extremely accommodating! I faced various issues with submitting assignments and late assignments but she was always willing to listen and helped me out a lot! Would definitely take her class again just because of how understanding she is. Class was not bad either. Learnt a few interesting things throughout!,the online class is easy if you keep up with the assignments. everything is open book except for the final and the course just follows along with the textbook. the work is crammed into 8 weeks so it feels like a lot but worth it to not have to take a whole semester if this is not your thing. i have an A- so far and am a math major,Heavy work,I loved this class! Because of it I'm going to minor in anth. Prof Smalls was so easy to talk to and I got a lot out of going to office hours and asking questions. I didn't agree with all her takes on things but she knows her stuff. The lectures make a lot more sense if you do the reading (which isn't bad compared to similar classes).,"this was an ok class. about half the lectures were interesting and the rest super boring. there are a ton of terms that seem really similar so unless you read and take notes, they trick you on exams. the guest lecturers were ok and we actually did in-class activities which was kind of cool and different for a huge lecture! also some cool movies.",This class changed the way I thought about alot of things and the professor is really nice. The material is hard if you're not used to more abstract social science ideas but she explains everything really well - especially in office hours. She also uses a lot of current examples so it's easier to relate to.,"Poor lecturer, poorly formatted class. Took an interesting topic and made it terribly painful to listen too. Grading system was confusing. No technology allowed in class. Called people out in class for ""disrupting"" (i.e. texting, talking) when, in reality, her stopping class was much more distracting than a text. Way too strict for 100 level class.",She's a tough grader but lectures were really informative. i actually learned something from this class. Her lectures matched up with the book so it made studying easy if you had good notes. people looking for an easy blow off class won't do well tho!,"First of all, she seems like shes trying to be a good professor, and she'll curve things when they need to be curved. However, she's so vague on everything. Her pop quiz featured a slide with tiny print and a convoluted system where we sent in our answers through compass. She also calls out people like it's highschool.","Lectures are broad yet exams are crazy specific. Two exams in the class, totaling 45% of the semester grade. The midterm was very difficult, as it's hard to recall every detail from the lectures AND textbook. Many questions had answers that all seem reasonable, but one is ""more right"". Normally a straight A student and I got a D on the midterm.","She will call u out for being on your laptop in a lecture hall containing 200 other students, she doesn't know how to work technology, her extra credit assignment would probably take 24 hours to complete.",Even in a 300 person lecture she will stop class to yell at every single person using their phone or laptop. Incredible lack of understanding when it comes to excuses for missing a class. Avoid this class if you can or at least her.

Really passionate about his material. Great balance between participation and lecture. Cases are interesting and you learn a lot. Final was hard, but overall a great class.","Participation is very important - at least one or two times each class. Very passionate, and the class itself isn't boring at all. 2 Presentations and a final project are important and he grades tough. Not an easy A, but very achievable.","Participation is really important so say something at least once per class otherwise you're screwed (participation quantity over quality counts unfortunately).  He grades pretty hard considering how easy the material is, but he made class interesting.  Not an easy A.","Most important part of the class is participation. It's 20% of your final grade so you're screwed if you don't participate. Also, each group has to do 2 presentations throughout the semester and it can be difficult to do well on them since he's asks so many questions. But overall, he's really passionate about the subject and I enjoyed the class.","He's a very difficult grader. He stresses participation a lot. So just raise your hand and make nonsense comments. He's very full of himself. Going to his office hours is useless because he doesn't help you at all. Positives: he's enthusiastic and somehow always comes up with good questions during case presentations. Overall, don't recommend.","Your grade basically comes down to the group project, the final, and participation. You have a case due every class, but you get to skip 4. The quizzes are usually right off the powerpoints. No midterms. Overall, it's not that bad. Just make sure you go well on the group project and participate, if you want a good grade. Seems better than Perkins.",Class is really subjective. If you have Smith. Try be shameless by giving tons of bs opinions and you will do well.,"This class is based on class participation. Most students have B, it is kind of hard to get a C. There are individual cases and quizes. He usually give you back your papers the within a week or two.",He can't teach...at all. No updates on grades given &amp; the entire lecture is BS. No wonder he's not teaching anymore; maybe he's better suited to be researcher.,"It was his first year teaching this year, but overall, he did a good job. Class is straightfoward. Only complaint I would have is that you don't get regular updates on your standing in the class. He doesn't give grade reports at all during the semester."

Never used the textbook, but had to buy it in a package online in order to complete online homework.","She's really nice, but she expects you to be really thorough with your answers on homework and exams. Go to lecture and discussion and you should be fine. A lot of the topics covered in discussions will reappear on exams.",Very nice lady and willing to help. The class is an easy A if you do the homework. The class felt a little too much like high school with the group work and whatnot but attendance is not mandatory and you can just turn your homework in and leave if you can teach yourself with the online book. Calculators are allowed. She is a reasonable grader,"I liked Kathleen, but i think that is because i am a math person and i understood what she was saying","I was extremely excited for this class.  Then, she basically just sat back and didn't teach whatsoever.  The grading was ridiculous.  She should not be allowed to teach a 400-level course when all she has done is 100-level courses.","Even though the class went fast and her explanations were confussing, it was an easy math class. shes probably the best math teacher you will get at the u of i...","Where to begin. Smith seemed to get a sense of joy out of making her exams near impossible to pass. With a page of essay questions on math topics and math questions that are designed for ""only those who really really get the topic"" on her tests, its not hard to wonder how she still teaches at the University. Save yourself from her. Notes suck too.","She's okay, she messes up a lot on notes so just follow along well so you can catch her mistakes, sometimes you can get extra credit if you catch it.","Was really interested in this class until it actually started. The teaching is pointless and exams suck. Purposely made an exam impossible to finish to show us the results of being pressured for time. I ended up with a low C after the ""curve"" she had to use on that exam. Homework is easy and all exams are open book/note but don't let that fool you.",Professor Smith was very helpful to me when it came to grades,"The class is definitely not just an easy A.  If you go to office hours, she will help you a lot though.  Tutoring sessions are good, and they practically do the homework for you.  A pretty good class, I thought...",Never take any math class at U of I. Math 012 is the lowest math class and it wasn't easy. This class was not rigorous but you have to apply yourself to really learn understand it. All U of I math courses are made hard!! Take it at a community college.,"Take advantage of how willing she is to offer her extra time in tutoring. The class does move very fast, so don't miss lecture. Ever. But even if you do, just go to her office hours and she will make sure you understand.One of the best one-on-one explainers I've ever gotten help from. I was really worried about this class; but she makes it bearable","She's one of the best math teachers I've had. If you go to her office hours, or even just show up, she will dedicate time to you until you understand. The class is pretty difficult and you basically NEED ""tutoring"" to even get a remotely decent grade, however. I also agree that she moves pretty fast in lecture.",Although ELEMENTARY linear algebra..seems like a for sure college class.  Tough to keep up in class. You spend 90% of your time in lecture trying to copy what she writes. You don't get to listen to what she is explaining because you are busy writing.  Graders expect a lot on tests.. IF you try to understand.. a B is very attainable. Not a fun class,She moves along at such a fast pace that you can't even keep up. All that you can do is write it down and try to figure it out later,Don't do it.,"Very helpful, even though it is a large lecture, she teaches as though it is a class of 30, answering all questions!","Not very good teacher, ambiguous and hard to follow.",She's awesome at office hours.

She does seem to know everything and is always available to help, but class itself can be boring. It's a required course, so there's not much choice about it. Assignments are sort of interesting and there are not too many, but she gives  a LOT of readings. Humanly impossible.",Extremely responsive and very helpful. Well thought out syllabus.,"As is said her lectures are rather boring. She does know the subject inside and out, but it's a dry part of LIS. She does get amused and chuckles throughout the online lecture which is fine, but a trifle odd. There's a ton of reading and if you're stuck with bad group members, you should tell her. She won't change your group but she'll understand.","She does alright for teaching stuffy required material.  Lecture is boring, but she does laugh uncomfortably throughout, so that's a bonus.

He was a terrible professor that often made the class uncomfortable.  He could not teach problems at all. Often he would speak very quickly as if to get through the material without any consideration for whether students were actually learning. Essentially, he was just a talking head. Would ramble frequently.","Professor Smith is a great professor who truly cares about his students and gives great lectures. His exams are pretty straightforward as they're based on the homework, pop quizzes, and problems he does in class. Just be aware Fin 300 requires a lot of work and is by no means an easy class but that is the same way no matter what professor you take.",Great professor. Very good at explaining. Cares about students. Straightforward exams and quizzes.,"I took FIN 300 twice, and Professor Smith made this dreaded class WAY better. I actually enjoyed going to class. The pop quizzes are fair.

I did alright in that class, but it's definitely not an easy gen. ed like you would have wanted.",Very interesting class. Solomon is really interesting lecturer and he loves telling stories about his expeditions that relate to the material taught in lectures. Exams require a bit of memorization but you can spend a couple of hours before the exam memorizing and easily pull off an A.,Just a really funny guy. It's like having a comedian as a professor.,amazing teacher!!!,"Solomons is a great professor, but I did not enjoy his class at all. There is a lot of busy work, and a lot of reading and memorization. Lots of little assignments you have to do.

Math has some extended deadlines, it was shortly before the final. Retaking it created a couple issues, but I was stressed by the arbitrary nature of the class. About 3 (not long) homework problems all semester, no syllabus, no book, only partially distributed notes with errors, gave identical exam 2 and 3. Wat",Sowers' class was the worst class I've had at UIUC. He had no plan for the class and made it up as he went along. We didn't cover the material that one expects to learn in real analysis. The whole experience was a waste of my time and money and its a disgrace that the math dept. has so little oversight over their courses.,"He is the worst teacher I have ever met. Before him, I thought all the American professors are friendly, helpful and experienced in the teaching field, but he is absolutely not. He doesn't teach real analysis and he doesn't follow what he said.","The consensus of the class is that he isn't teaching us the material he should be teaching us and that's not good for anyone. All the exams are a lot harder than he first tells us they wll be because he doesn't adquately prepare us for them. I hope for your sakes he doesn't teach this honors course again, you won't learn real analysis.","Read the textbook, do the homework, sit in the front of the class room. Simple recipe to guarantee an A. Sowers is a menacing dude, extremely menacing, and quite funny too. I'll miss the witty speeches given before surprise quizzes and him calling out students who leave once they realize there isn't a quiz... only to quiz them at the end of class!","Dr. Sowers cares that his students understand the material, and though his exams can be challenging, he doesn't use trick questions and he gives lots of partial credit.  He's got a great sense of humor, too, which really helps you stay awake in class - the material can be quite dry at times.","Keeps lectures interesting by involving students and has a good sense of humor. If you pay attention in lecture you will hardly need to look at the text book. Exams are very straight forward, not too hard to get an A.","Does not quite prepare the lectures, but he is very familiar with this field. Really likes to ask students questions in class, which makes me a bit stressful. The exams are not difficult, if you have tried several old exams from his archival.","His teaching order was different from the textbook, which made it hard to use the book efficiently. The way he carries his class could be made more comprehensible, but overall, he is a good teacher, dedicated and demanding.","Awful prof. Speaks fast and confuses everyone. Also uses notation different from the book , which made class confusing. However, he had a nice curve at the end. So I managed to get an A-.",One of the best in the department.

He really cares about his students and wants them to learn and you receive that positive energy in every lesson.,"Really awesome professor. I had him multiple times during my first year of italian. He really helped set me met up for success here at the University of Oregon pursuing italian. Pierpaolo tries his best to make sure that the material is clear and understood. He has no problem coming down to  the student level, which helps so much!","Pierpaolo was one of the few professors I've had that really did care about his students, how they were doing in his class, and helped them in any way he could. He was fun, easygoing and also presented the material in a helpful and useful manner! Best first Italian professor I could have asked for. 10/10 would recommend."

Overall, great TA's who make the learning more clear and are super helpful with whatever you need.","Honestly, this class has a lot of organization issues. Span, if you ever read this, LISTEN TO YOUR TA(s). Most of them seem to have a better understanding of how the course should be ran. He was a good instructor though. I would recommend.","Professor Span is probably one of the most enjoyable lecturers I've ever had.

He was willing to answer questions and was a nice guy.  However, I could have not listened to the lectures and still gotten my A.  Not a good class.",No Comments,Wonderful instructor.

Too much HW but good Prof,It is a very dedicated professor but it is not clear. The subject its really demanding but not conceptually clear. I found it not good in the end. To much work and not much learned.,I took Dynamics with Prof. Spencer. He is a good professor but very hard to get a hold of. Lectures are very clear. He uses a digital input instead of writing on the board which comes with its set of pros and cons.  TA was helpful in office hours.,"He is not a good lecturer.  He diverted attention from the main principles of the class by getting us to focus on MATLAB, which was unnecessary for the subject material.    The book he asked us to purchase was terrible. There are books of better quality on the market that he could have recommended.  He showed very little interest in our learning.","He is very smart, and is very good at explaining things. He sometimes comes across as mean or crass, but i think in general he is a nice guy. The class is run very well. I didn't do well on some of the tests, but he curved the class substantially.","Good professor, very smart. However, if you go ask him a question and you are not an Asian female, he will be very condescending. Do not go to his office hours, you will be ignored. The class overall is run well. Tests aren't impossible and the homework is from the book and relatively easy, but this class TAKES A LOT OF TIME"

Spies is a nice guy, but tests were very difficult, which is why the grade scale is generous. Get old quizzes/exams from friends;he heavily reused material. Draw out mechanisms over&amp;over til you get them. I didn't realize how large my brain capacity was til i took 354.","His exams do not test on concepts, but rather how well you can memorize absolutely EVERYTHING. Yes, he answers his students with clarity and kindness, but he expects too much from his students. I even doubt he can take his own exam and get a 100%.","Doesn't look at students while lecturing or answering questions. I have walked into his exams feeling 100% prepared, and then I leave each one absolutely depressed. I wasn't too happy that he emphasized a certain detailed topic, so I spent a lot of time on it, and then he tested on something else. Exams are terrible, unless you're pro.","Hey, it's a hard class but you learn a ton.  Professor Spies, always answered questions fully when asked and got back to me on every email question I sent him.  His test are hard but if you study and pay attention, as in any class, you'll do well.","Professor Spies was a nice guy,until you see his tests. Almost every page is blank with a question asking you to write out some ridiculous mechanism that you see going across like 6 slides in lecture. First half of course is real easy, make sure you get an A in that half because the 2nd half will kill your grade. I like Spies though, nice guy he is",I'm a straight A student who got an A in his class. His tests are 10 times worse than orgo exams. He just makes really ambiguous tests. You'll have to memorize more info in that class than all the classes combined that you take at college..I didn't think I had a brain capacity limit. I heard reading the book helps. DO WELL in the 1st half of course,"worst mcb prof ive had so far.  unfortunately you cannot avoid this class.  he is monotone, covers insane amounts of material, and writes the hardest tests i have ever attempted to take.  my grade for the first half of the course was an A and his half of the course took me way down.","Worst bio professor I've ever had.  Clearly not interested in teaching students.  Very pompous and monotone during lecture.  He puts so much material on tests it's ridiculous.  Also makes tests very, very hard.  This is the first bio class I would recommend reading the book for, because he takes questions from it.  Overall, terrible professor.",What he expects us to know for one exam can and should be covered over an entire semester. His 'study guides' and 'review sessions' are not helpful in the least because he expects you to know WAY more info than can be covered on a 200pt exam.,"Awful professor.  This is one of those classes that you'll memorize tons of useless details for the exam and then forget them as soon as the exam is over.  He has a very monotonous voice and intimidated me when I asked him about research.  I like biochemistry, but he ruins it for me!","Spies seems like a nice enough guy, he just has Ben Stein's voice (Bueller?...Bueller?...). He reads straight from the slides in a completely level tone so you cannot tell what is important and what is just him rambling. Really easy to fall asleep in class. Reading the book helps somewhat. Tests require serious attention to detail","Really good lecturer, straigtforward tests -&gt; What?? This guy was a horrible teacher and not becasue he was hard (I got an A), but because he clearly did not care at all for the students or the class and his exams were vaguly worded leaving you wondering how detailed of an answer he was expecting. He wouldn't answer qustions after class either!","As a student who enjoys the mcb major and does well, I can say with confidence that he was easily the WORST professor I have ever had during my time at U of I. Not only does he speak in a monotone voice during the entire lecture (on purpose), he almost never looks at his audience (students) when he speaks - how did this guy become a professor here?",Spies is the kind of professor if you get to know him you will love what has to offer. by far one of the nicest professor I had ever met. You might not see it in the class but if you go his office hour he will help you. I dont really talk to him anymore but last semester he helped me a lot.,Spies was an awful teacher. He (yes it's a man) just read straight from his slides - he clearly only cared about his research. The hardest and most boring MCB class I have ever had to take.

His revision process for essays appears a bit hefty, but he definitely knows what hes talking about when he comes to writing and well help you get better. Be prepared to be in class though; only three freebie absences!!!!","He's very nice, but clearly a new teacher. Discussion is somewhat slow. Books are okay. Some are a little repetitive but if he teaches this course again Oryx and Crake was awesome! I would recommend him, he definitely helped with my writing.

His patience is fleeting, but he does care and tries to do what he can.","R.S. is a stud, bottom line.  The most badass Indian man I've met, if you goto class, and pay attention, you'll be set for an A, at worst a B.  All of his tests are half in class/half take home.

However, do not take section X. The class is graded only by tests on midterms and finals. The tests are also only multiple choice and have random questions which makes it hard. Most of the material you have to learn is from the textbook. Also no + or - grades.","He is literally reading from an online textbook every class! He gives you ""outlines"" but they're actually just the section names of what he's reading from, and he reads straight from his printed textbook for each lesson. Because of this, unless you can write down and study each word he is saying - tests are very hard. Even then they're still hard.","ONE OF MY FAVORITE PROFESSORS. The way he teaches is very intuitive, he has a structure and follows an outline, but doesn't just read from a slide. He is very passionate about the material and is so goofy. Everything is so interesting, class flies by","My only complaint is with the grading of his exams. Each exam has its own curve, so an A could be a 44/55, 38/55, etc. But the only thing that really matters is the final point total for which he makes a grade scale for at the end. So you never really know what your grade is until the final one is posted into the grade book.",Makes Psychology much more difficult then needs to be. Whole grade is based on four exams and a subject pool. Exams are pretty hard but curved. Lectures do not cover stuff in the book so you have to go to lecture plus read the book. This takes up a lot of time.(About 8-10 modules)You never know whats going to pop u on tests. Take regular section.,"The biggest thing about PSYC100X is that your grade is based on 4 exams and subject pool participation (basically 20 pts extra credit), and his exams are half based on the book and half based on lecture. His tests are pretty hard so you have to read the book and go to lecture, but there are huge curves (for my class, a 44/55 and 38/55 were As).",I had little motivation to go to class as the lectures only include a couple words for 1 hour and 20 minutes and Prof. Srull just talks the whole time. I had no clue what the test questions would be on or what to take notes about!

He knows lots of insights on Psychology. 4 tests plus subject pool added together make up your final grade. There are very BIG curves on the test, but if you want to do well, you probably have to show up to majority of the lectures. A lot of people don't go to class, so that's why the curves are big","Very nice guy, pretty quirky, and a great lecturer. He makes the material very interesting and easy to understand. Tests are a little difficult (you need to read the book), but nothing too bad. He curves the tests and also the class at the end (very generously). Overall, great teacher, great class. Wish he taught more courses!",Easy A but the readings do take long. Lectures are long and boring.  No homeworkquizzes and only 4 tests and subject pool.  It took me two days to prepare for the tests.,"Easy class but poorly organized with little hope of actually learning material. Without a curve, nobody would pass the class. Exam questions are on specific studies he mentions briefly in class, and you cannot look up the study on your own since he doesn't cite them. Do not take this class if you are genuinely interested in the topic.","You have to attend every lecture and take good notes, but you can get away with cramming the chapters the night before and get an A.  Very funny and likeable professor. Made the class go faster with his anecdotes.","He's a pretty goofy guy but he knows psychology in and out. He has interesting stories and gives good examples. He teaches section X, which is different from any of the other sections. There is no homework just 4 exams and a subject pool. His exams are pretty hard, but he uses a generous curve. Just go to class, take notes, read the book, and study","A is manageable if you read the book and attend lectures. Exams are tricky, but the curve is forgiving. Overall pretty fun class.","I don't know how this class got a reputation of being easy, it is anything but easy. The only ""easy"" part of this class is that there is no homework except reading. Curve isn't that crazy as people made it seem. Take the regular section.",Srull is a pretty good professor. Class is not mandatory and can be boring but it is helpful for the exams.  He explains things very clearly and simply.  Exams are tough but if you read the book and go to class it is not bad.  Very generous curve.,"He's a good professor. Going to class and taking notes is a must as some of the stuff he says literally shows up word for word on the exams. Sometimes he will talk about one bullet point for almost 30 minutes but once you get past his style of lecturing, it's a good class. Curve is generous just make sure you read all the sections from the book","Uses overhead projectors with minimum words and goes off on pointless tangents. There are about 10 chapters to read in the textbook for the exam, and his exams are very specific and very hard."

If you don't like reading academic articles (or just articles in general) the class may not be for you as most nights there were 20-40 pages of reading assigned.,"I enjoyed this teacher, however, she is a tough grader.

Sarah Stanley take an hour and twenty minutes to cover an eighth of a chapter.

Easy homework, good grading!!!","The tests are extremely difficult and the book will barely help. The HW and quizzes DO NOT prepare you for the exams.

The class average was below 20%.  Very unorganized, does not seem to care about student at all.",Terrible professor.Homework has absolutely nothing to do with exam.Spend hours on homework which have no relevance to quiz or exams. Quizzes are only proofs and this is the only TAM class which is completely based on proofs.Looses homework and quizzes never on track with schedule which makes him rushes through the hard concepts.Not helpful at all.,"Material is presented in such a way that it is extremely difficult to stay attentive. Lectures are hard to follow. Homework has no relevance to quizzes nor exams. Quizzes and exams are almost all theory/proofs, with few concrete problems. Majority of class failed the first exam. Solution: Throw it out and make final worth 50% of the class grade.",If u like to plug-n-chug #'s in to a formula then I wouldn't recommend taking class with Strazewski since he likes to spend his time and gives exams on deriving and understanding the concepts behind the formulas. he talks a lot abt topics that are actual applications of what we do in class.  If u go to his office hrs he is very helpful.,"Agree with the previous comments. Starsewski should NOT be a teacher, plain and simple. He's a homely man, but completely disorganized, impossible to follow, and has a spaztic lecture style. And I sat in front! Worst part is, his tests do NOT make up for it - he actually expected us to know what the hell he was talking about in class. Curves.","Worst professor I've ever had. His delivery was mumbled and unclear, and he used very poor examples in class. His tests were not fair at all, and they were nothing like TAM tests should be. Other class had 12% higher average on one test. Avoid at all costs.",My worst experience at UIUC His lectures were boring and his exams always included proofs derivations and theory questions. On our Final 6 out of 9 questions were deriving equations given on the equation sheet. He also complained that people were showing up late or not coming to class so much that one of the final questions said like I did in class,"I had him for 370 and 371; couldn't avoid it.  I have to say though, I saw improvement in his teaching and grading.  Definitely not the best professor I've had, but he did care about the class, and he made an effort to be better.","He was a terrible teacher that did not care for his students, nor the class.","I'm the last person to go online and blast my professors. I'm a good student with a very high GPA; but this is simply necessary. Starzewski should not be teaching. Do yourself a favor, find a new professor...take it a different semester...avoid this guy at all costs. His course was without a doubt my worst experience at UIUC.",Incomprehensible lectures. Draws tiny unclear diagrams on the board. Tests frequently include questions that you can only answer if you've been to lecture.,"Arguably the worst professor I've experienced on this campus.  Homeworks were unrelated to all exams and grading was extremely subjective and done without citing what was correct/incorrect.  Lectures are excruciatingly boring, exams are impossible...his idea of answering questions is trailing off in an unintelligible mumble.  Worst prof ever."

When I had my TA look over the second paper he made a ton of changes &amp; suggestions &amp; I got an A.",I love Jesse!,"He tries to make the class interesting and enjoyable. Material was somewhat dry. Class is barely any work. Only 2 papers, 2 tests, and attendance to discussions.",He was unbelievably helpful whenever I had questions.  He was funny during lecture and was always interesting to listen too.  He had absolutely HORRIBLE TAs though! But at least he wasn't bad to look at =),"Jesse is a good lecturer, and is pretty receptive to students ideas. This class was ridiculously easy. If you have written a philosophy paper before you will get an A on both papers. The midterm and final are well written and easy. Just fill out the study guide and look over it for an hour before the exam and you should be fine.","The professor was really nice. The class itself and material--so overdone. For a gened, this should have been a lot more clear and easy. Interesting only if you're analytical and like talking about theories. it's all theory basically. there are easier geneds.",He's a good professor and has a desire to get people to learn and understand the material. I kinda wish he would grade everything rather than the TA's...I don't think they know what they're doing. Jesse is really easy to talk to and is willing to spend a lot of extra time helping students.,"This class is SUPER easy! I guess i lucked out and got the better TA. Jesse is a great professor and hes hilarious, but can sometimes be kinda boring. Theres only 2 papers a midterm and a final, both of which are very easy. As long as you show up and take notes, you'll ace the midterm and final","Logic is really terrible, and I would not recommend this class to anyone.  God.  Jesse rambles on and is sometimes hard to understand.  The way he talks is annoying, and lecture is a waste of time.  Bad class.","this class was supposed to be a blow off and easy A, but the TAs grade too hard. This class is so boring and its gonna bring down my GPA. Would not recommmend","Phil 101 has four grades the entire course, two tests and two papers. He teaches everything in class, so I rarely read. The book is confusing but he explains it in class.

So kind, charismatic, yet so incredibly knowledgeable. He has 20 reference points for any topic you could possibly raise up.

He is extremely enthusiastic about his topic.  You can tell he LOVES LOVES LOVES teaching students.  And his office hours are a blast.

AND he's on facebook!!","Easily the best professor I had. So good I took both of his Russian history courses. His lectures are interesting. I don't think I was ever bored.

He teaches well, but sometimes it felt like I learned how to take test/do homework, not the concepts themselves. Test were tricky, but if you try on homework, labs, and quiz's you should be fine.","Stelzer is a fun professor and his lectures are always interesting. The grading scale makes it harder to get a B, so watch out.","Prof. Stelzer seems to be involved in a lot of research regarding the best methods to teach undergraduate courses. You can tell that he really cares about how his students are doing because his lectures affect his research as well. He makes himself incredibly personable in a 300 person lecture hall, and I always loved going to his lectures!","Fun lectures, understands the student's point of view, made me glad that I took the class","Even though the class was difficult, he makes everything sound very interesting and really puts a lot of effort into making lectures fun.","Stelzer is awesome! I thought the class was well organized and very reasonably graded. Lots of cool material, useful lectures, neat demos! He really cares about the class so it doesn't feel so impersonal in such a huge lecture.","I thought the class was pretty difficult, but honestly so many people have so many differing opinions on it that it can go any way for you.

Lots of fun!",awesome professor,"Funny professor, and he teaches great.","Amazing professor, clears all the concepts very well in class and a plus point he is really funny","This class was hard. If you are good at physics, you should be okay. However, the teaching method used wasn't helpful. Professor seemed to care for students but I found this class confusing and annoying. I've taken four physics classes at UIUC, so far they have been pretty dull, boring and confusing. Department should probably change things up.",Amazing lecturer and very good at answering questions even though he does it with a very subtle sarcastic attitude that is humorous if you catch it.  Uses lots of good props and in class examples to show how the physics works.  Tests are tough but you have a pretty clear idea of what you are about to get into from the practice exams.,"Don't take physics here- hard and boring. Professor was decent at explaining, pretty good at office hours but that doesn't make up for the way the class was comprised.","I personally didn't like this class, tests were hard but the homework was doable.

Her classwork is definitely doable, it's just that you have reading to do and if you have no interest in doing the reading, you get screwed.","Good class.  Lots of reading.. you can get away with skipping some of it but the class is mostly participation based.  Exams are written but not bad at all if you've read.

Learned an immense amount, hands down would take a class with him again.","I'm pretty sure the only reason people like him is because of everyone has an abusive relationship with him. If this is America then you really have to work to succeed. Alex somehow turns a boring stats lecture into an entertaining, terrifying 50 minutes. He is the most prepared professor I've had. Just don't ask stupid questions and always think.","I personally like his lectures for STAT 400/410 but not that much for STAT 420. I liked the class, he is still a great lecturer, it's just a matter of efficiency. I just feel like homework that uses a lot of R should be submitted online. It's much more easy to read then printing them out.","Most of the time during the course is in poor efficiency. The most stupid activity he likes is tossing a coin rather than instruct us knowledge. Even though you look like a Russia, you should not be that ludicrously enthusiastic. The course is too easy as 400 level. The content could be more difficult.","I just finished taking STAT 400 over the summer. You will absolutely love his enthusiasm, entertaining jokes, and clear presentation of the material.

See you around!",He is awesome.,Alex comes extremely prepared to class and can inspire you to do more math. Only missing a dog named Hachi. 10/10 would watch again,"Although Alex keeps saying what a horrible person he is, he is a REALLY GREAT professor. I feel he was born funny and his lectures are never boring, full of jokes and memes. He posts worksheets before classes and if he covers anything that is not on the worksheet, he will type it up later and upload it to compass. My favorite stat professor ever.","Highly recommended. His notes are textbook. You don't need to spend money on books. I liked his lectures in general, but he doesn't have microphones and I just couldn't hear him well (maybe it was just the problem with the room). I've taken both 400 and 410 with him and Idk why but his personality seemed different in stat 400 and 410.",pls give worksheets. Its infuriating not to have them &gt;:(,Alex's class is not hard when he provides the lecture notes/examples regularly. His lectures went awfully fast and I did not enjoy them at all. It was suffering. I am more than happy to have the notes downloaded ahead of each lecture so that I can have time to preview them.,continue giving worksheets plz. :),Amazing lectures,Hate his lecture style. Has 5+ worksheets for every week and in lecture he just randomly picks one and goes over the problems. Class had no direction just solving random problems. Plus most worksheets don't even have the solutions to them. Infuriating &gt;:-(,"Alex was a good guy. His lecture was funny and he would explain the point several times. I took his STAT 410 and 420 in my last yr in UIUC, to be honest, he was one of my favorite professors. Although I was graduate, I still miss him","Taking a class with him is like going on a roller coaster ride. You don't know what to expect in the next classes and how he's going to react to his student. He might be mean to a class that never participates, so TRY to be active. He probably memorized all his lectures by now and he shows this off at every class. Hope your reading this Alex."

I suggest going to every class. If you write down everything he says in lecture and study from your notes, then his tests aren't so difficult. Textbook feels supplementary because all test questions come from lecture.","Good professor. Clearly knows his stuff. Don't skip lecture, everything on the test is based on lecture. Gives pop quizzes. He makes lecture interesting and has a passion for the subject. However, he can be a bit disorganized. The midterm and final were hard and very specific. Don't expect practice tests or a review either. Would recommend.",Prof Stewart is a babe. An absolute gem. He's really witty/funny which makes the class fly by he and explains things very clearly. A+,"See that flaming red pepper? Yeah, I'd say that's accurate. Stewart is a spicy man with layers of  intelligence and wit. I took this class thinking I was going to be watching  vids of seals and dolphins, but boy was I wrong. As long as you study, pay attention, and find men age 50+ attractive, you'll be fine.","Professor is a child. Seemed like he was high during class, would go on long rambling monologues that had little to do with the topic. Refused to add structure to course when I told him I had difficulty learning in his lecture. Failed his class, retook with another professor and got a B+.","Stewart is awesome. Not only does he make lectures more interesting, they are easy to understand. Essays are super easy because he doesn't even grade them himself.","Currently a freshman in my first semester and Dr. Stewart is definitely my favorite professor. I look forward to going to class and he makes his lectures very fun. It's a very good natural science gen-ed to take, though you have to work for an A. You will learn a lot of ""cocktail information"" from this guy. He's hilarious!","Hands down one of my favorite professors. He made class interesting, fun and I looked forward to his class. No one notices if youre not in class but i clicker points are taken. I learned much more than I expected and he his personality makes lectures enjoyable to attend. I definitely suggest taking any class with him!","I personally think that he's funnier than Altaner, but I would rather take the course with Altaner because he doesn't do i-Clicker participation. Go to classes because attendance is a huge component in your grade.",Easy. Cool dude.,Funny!,He is a good professor and is always making the class laugh.  The material gets boring at times but he tries to make it interesting.  Attendance for both lecture and discussion is mandatory because I clicker is 10% of grade and discussion assignments and homework due in discussion are a huge percent of your grade.,BEST CLASS I'VE EVER TAKEN! he makes jokes constantly during lecture. the homework is easy and you don't really need to read the book although this is not a blow off or easy A class! overall he makes this a great class and i always looked forward to his lectures...and i even learned some things in the process.,"Its a large class so no one notices if you're gone. but the clicker questions presented during lecture do count into your grade. He goes off on tangents often which can be annoying but he's funny and you actually learn something from the class. You do need to read the book though, he doesn't always go over everything on the exams.","He was definitely interesting...always expect to stay exactly until the bell rings, he never lets class out early. He taught us what we needed to know. Made sarcastic comments a lot, so that made class bearable.",it is very important to attend class for clicker questions. He is really funny and i thought he was hot. HW was not difficult but it is really important to not blow the class off..,This class was NOT the blowoff I thought it would be...you really have to go to class for your iclicker points and so you understand the material...reading the book doesn't really help.  The tests are kinda hard...he's really funny though and his rants are great!  I guess he's kinda cute in an old guy sort of way...Do the extra credit in discussion,"Going to class is pretty important to understanding the material and what will be on the tests.  He tells funny, interesting stories, and loves his work.  I'm not much of a science person, but I love this class.  The tests are medium-difficult.  You definitely have to study.  Not a blow off class, but not a TOO much work.  He's a great teacher.","After the first exam I realized that going to class was important, as well as very interesting. Great teacher. Not a blowoff class as I was hoping, but definitely recommended","Pay attention in lecture and study the notes you should be able to get an A.  The online quizzes and extra credit on the group portion of tests are easy points. Dr. Stewart is hilarious, tells crazy stories, and I really looked forward to going to class."

When he woke up it was always to say/make a very insiteful statement/question that left you thinking.,"Stewy, well stwey was an interesting guy.  His lectures are ridulously hard to understand, and he uses words with like 30 letters in them.  He would be a good teacher if he could talk using normal words and sentences.  He also tried to make green tea for 300 people in like a little tea pot... smart.","The class can be interesting and it is a different approach to history, however it is easy to get lost in Stewart's lectures.  Overall he is a good professor and always willing to help.","Dr. Stewart is a fun professor and an overall great guy.  Global history was an easy class, but you learned something too (and got 2 gen eds out of the way!) so if you need a history or humanities, I'd get a class with Dr. Stewart!","Very nice!

She is incredibly clear about the content and what you need to do to do well in the class. Pay attention to what she says.","One of the best professors on this campus. She is so down to earth and funny. She grades leniently. She actually made the course material fun and interesting to learn so students are very engaged. No exams, 3 essays, and a few assignments,and participation. Writing this before registration starts so u know which course to take (this one).",Easy A. Study guide is exactly the same as the exam. Memorize it and you're fine.  I-clicker quiz on HW reading (easy). Iclicker quiz at end of lecture on what was just taught (easier). She's interesting and knows the material well. She actually went to some of the places she has pictures of and did archaeological work there,"So far, she's the best professor I've had here at Illinois.  Though some of her references to internet memes in lecture are a bit cringeworthy, she more than makes up for it by being incredibly upbeat and makes the subject matter of myth come alive.  This is despite lecturing in front of a full Foellinger Auditorium.","Really easy, interesting class. I highly recommend taking it. Make sure you go to lecture because iClicker points are a major part of the grade.","By far the best teacher I have ever had. Makes lectures fun, interesting, and engaged.

The class is very laid back in class. He is interested in his students as people, but will also tell you a lot about him that maybe you didnt want to know.

Tells you all you need to know to make lots of money in life.  Tells a lot of stories in class, jokes a lot, notes are not horrible either. Class is mandatory since test questions are directly out of the notes, but who wouldn't go since he is so awesome?","Stoddard's a pretty cool teacher. Real down to earth, not out to screw you. He also uses class time to talk about non-class stuff, which is always needed in lectures. Tests are straightforward from the powerpoints he gives.

Would recommend!",Storage is extremely enthusiastic and passionate about the course. He gives clear explanations of the material and is easily accessible outside of class. I would highly recommend taking his class.,Currently taking his psych 100 class and it is awesome. He teaches well and clearly cares about his students. He gets on our level but also encourages us to think deeply about lots of interesting topics. 10/10 would recommend.,"Daniel was a great professor; he was able to articulate the content very well and was very knowledgeable in the field. There are a lot of extra credit opportunities and the class itself is interesting and engaging. If you are able to take any psych course with Daniel, do it!!",Excellent. You won't be disappointed!,"Clearly cares about his students, responds to emails quickly, and is approachable.

Cancels class frequently, attendance gives you E.C.","REALLY BORING LECTURER, talks into his computer screen instead of talking to his students, trolls during exams - they're way harder than anything we do in class. Cancels class a lot, so that's a bonus. Don't take this class if you don't have to.","Good, knowledgable professor. Boring lectures, though the subject matter is tough to make interesting. Make sure you attend every lecture, as lecture notes/slides are not posted online.",Incredibly boring but that makes the occasional dry joke even funnier.

You have to study all the translations up to the time of the test in order to translate maybe 1 or 2 passages.

He doesn't do attendance or clickers at all.,"He's a very enthusiastic and passionate teacher. You can definitely tell he loves what he does.

You have to study for exams because the class is only out of 300 pts, so that can screw you if you slip up at all.","great class, great teacher!","One of the greatest and easiest class ever. You get extra credit for going to lectures, the tests are easy, and the lectures are straightforward, and actually really interesting.

Definitely the best life science gen ed on campus.",Easiest class in the world. I NEVER went to class unless there was an exam.

I'm definitely glad that happened because Andy is so much easier to understand, has fun teaching the class, and is soooo helpful!","One of the most interesting and fun classes I've taken so far. Homework is easy, and exams are pretty much common sense in a lot of ways. Show up to lecture and you'll ace the exams no prob. Discussion sections are easy points, however getting the right TA can make all the difference. Would highly recommend if you need an easy Life Science!","This class was AWESOME! I had no interest in taking this class whatsoever at the start of the semester, but I learned so much that I ended up loving it. It was an easy A, but I got a ton out of taking this class. His TAs are awesome too!","Andy is such a good professor and one of the best in the School of Integrative Biology.  He actually cares about his students and infuses lectures with a lot of cool videos and demonstrations to engage his students.

I liked his lectures more than almost anyone else's I have ever had.  i never went to class and got B grades on the exams which is what I admittedly deserved.  The extra credit was too hard, though...5 points for going to three seminars on really complicated echinoderm biomechanics and stuff like that, then writing them up.",He is so funny and engaging in his lectures! His tests are easy but purposeful. If you just go to class and pay attention you will have fun and get an A.,"This class rocks. Easy A.

So you can drop your lowest test score or not take the final. BOTTOM LINE: EASY CLASS, GOOD GEN ED","Blatently lied to me about previous exams that were on the school website the semester before being different than the ones he used this semester.  He did this to save his own behind since his exams are almost exactly the same, others who have previous ones have an advantage.  If you have them, the course is literally a breeze.

Definitely an interested class to take.","If there's one word to describe professor Sullivan, it would be passionate. Part of what makes this course so interesting is the excellent assortment of literature she has compiled, along with her deep knowledge in the subject.

She's semi-retired though, so I don't know how long they'll be offered.","Although I received a good grade in the only class I took with her, she told me that I would be better off applying for a masters degree elsewhere since my work would not be ""up to par"" with what get me into that particular university.  I assumed she would be the first to encourage any of her students to apply anywhere.","She has a very interesting background and her accent is adorable!

It's a freshman only class, and a great lit to start off with.","She seems to care about her students, so she'll change due dates and give extra assignments (for points) if you bring it up.  Also, I love British accents... the only bad thing is that all she did was summarize the books in class.  Minimal analysis and not much room for interpretation/creativity : (","Professor Sullican was extremely nice, very funny, and did everything in her power to try to make class interesting. (she succeeded). She was always more than willing to help and was very accomodating. Also, the work was very little...read and push some effort into the homework and you will get an A.","Professor Sullivan is a sweet, witty, and extremely intelligent woman who loves to work her students.  Lots and lots of reading that you MUST keep up with to get a good grade in the course, as all of her quizzes and tests are based on readings and movies we watch in class.","Took several classes with Prof. Sullivan, several years ago. She is one of the best teachers I have ever had, brilliant, knowledgeable, into the material, witty. Definitely not for those who are unwilling to work.   And she used to be very attractive in a kind of a British upper class way, but as I said, this was some years ago.","She's so intelligent that she doesn't really know how to speak to students. She's so confusing, but if you do the readings you'll be fine. If you don't like lit., definately don't take this class with her.",Great! funny too,She's a very smart professor. Tries very hard to accomodate students. Be prepared to use compass and if you plan on sleeping you may as well stay home and sleep there because she'll embarass you.,Professor Sullivan is a great teacher.  Her passion in both her subject matter and students engage the students.,"Very smart, but it is difficult to understand her.  And she has a hard time keeping my interest in what she is saying."

He's passionate and know what he's talking about. Would definitely recommend for an easy, interesting class.","He is a good professor and respects students a lot. If you have any questions regarding the reading material, just ask him directly in lectures. No ppt and just like libreal art education class format, discussion-based. The paper topics are hard, but you can redo paper to improve scores. No textbook, just e version reading material posted.",Very awesome professor. The readings becomes very repetitive but interesting. I agree with the two comments below. Basically he is a great teacher and is very passionate about his research.,"Great class, pretty relaxed setting. I agree with the comment below. We did do readings out of the book so get that. I actually found those readings to be some of the most interesting. The readings in general got repetitive but he's a great professor. Six papers and u can rewrite them. Overall, I liked the class.","Talks a lot about his own research, an interesting guy who really believes in what he does. Do the reading, because he basically would assign people into groups, and discuss readings in class. Only six short paper through the semester, not so hard, and you can always turn in rewrites."

He pretty notorious for his tangents, which if you're not interested in the subject I can see how that's annoying. But I really enjoy them. He's very knowledgeable and approachable. Great guy.",Class is genuinely enjoyable to go to. When going on tangents he does spend too much time on specifics though. His professional studies seem to be focused on Ethics and Kant so Phil 105 is the perfect class for him to teach. Still I'd take any class with him as the professor.,"I love philosophy, but I wasn't a fan of how Sussman taught the class. It was incredibly slow and not very engaging. He goes on lengthy tangents and I found it difficult to stay focused. The class wasn't thought provoking but as long as you're a good writer, the class is easy.","An extraordinarily nice man. I've never once seen him be anything other than kind, patient, and understanding towards his students.

Good class to take, makes stuff easier to understand.","He is an amazing professor. He bothered to go to discussion sections and learn every student's name.

Its not easy, but so worth it!","He is incredible. Of all the teachers that I have ever met, I have never met a teacher as talented (or cute!) as DS.","He was the most funny, witty, smart, talented teacher that I have ever met. He made me think in ways that I never thought in before. He is never boring.","Professor Sussman is a great professor. While he does tend to ramble, and he always falls behind, as long as you attempt to engage with the material in your papers, you'll do fine. He likes you to say what you think about a philosopher's theory, not what they say about it. I really like this class.","If you consider yourself to be a thinker, especially when it comes to the way you should live your life then this is a class that you will enjoy.  It is not a blowoff class at all.  You need to do the readings and be able to reflect upon them and then be able to form your own opinions on what you have read.",Avoid this class as all costs! this class is long and boring and i got nothing out of i except for frustration. it seems like its his mission to distance the class from god...beware,"He's a great teacher and a brilliant philosopher, as well as a nice and funny guy","While Prof. Sussman's ratings are very low for 105 (I don't know, I haven't taken it), he was fantastic for 419.

He doesn't help at all. His lectures are irrelevant but he grades iClickers. The exams were extremely random and were specific facts that you have never learned. If you can't drop, make sure to read the text book.","I joined this class thinking that it would be somewhat interesting and easy. It isn't. The work is very tedious and he grades iClicker questions for accuracy. The in-class tests are very specific and require actually reading the textbook.. as far as a gen-ed goes, this is not the one to take.","Really nice guy, and willing to help you. But his assignments are difficult and time consuming. There is a homework assignment due every Friday and they are usually somewhat difficult, and most of the math on them is not on the exams. The exams are mostly qualitative and specific. This class is not as easy as some people think. Don't take it!","This class is extremely easy. Material is 80% common sense and 20% simple facts gained by paging through the text. Lectures can be boring, but he uses technology well with great videos and pictures. He is helpful to those who seek it and is very nice and quite intelligent. However, don't expect to take much away from the class, its just for fun.","Great guy with a nice touch of humor. Very smart, yet is very down to earth and very happy to answer the most basic of questions. The whole staff including the TA's are great.",Too hard for an elective 100 level astronomy class. Lectures extremely boring and discussions were a joke. I gained nothing from taking this course,"The other reviewer that took ASTR 121 was pretty much spot-on. Exams were very specific. I thought lectures were very interesting though. It's not a hard class, but it's definitely one to not underestimate.","His lectures meant nothing to the exams, the discussions were worthless, homework math rarely showed up on tests and the exams were entirely based on minute details of the textbook.  A nice guy, but ridiculous expectations for an elective astronomy class.","Lectures were boring, his discussion section was awful. It was nice that he reserved math for homework instead of tests, but he called on people at random to work things out on the board which is just not very nice"
1846914,3.2,Norma,Suvak,2,0.4736841303753021,Frau Suvak is sweet and helpful without being an easy-A professor. She understands our limitations and does her best to make us go through it. Her classes are fun and light. You don't feel the 50 minutes passing.,The class itself is pretty easy and straightforward however the professor is a bit of a dud. She flies through her power point without giving much time to take notes and refuses to post any notes online. Also attendance is required and she is extremely uptight about it.Don't miss more than 2 classes otherwise you automatically lose an entire grade.

Easy class that leaves students with valuable information permeated by a phenomenal lecturer.,"Professor Svolik is smart and a great lecturer.

A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF EXTRA CREDIT. WARNING: THE CLASS CAN GET PRETTTYYYY BORING.,"PS 397 was my favorite undergraduate class. Prof. Svolik is so knowledgeable, gives clear explanations, makes material interesting, has helpful teaching style. He inspired me to continue on with graduate school.","PS397 course was so well taught, I challenged my self and took his game theory class which was difficult but, out of all of my courses at U of I, the class that I got the most out of. I will always think of things in a 2x2 matrix of payoffs and losses. Thanks for one great experience, take any all his classes for a great challenge; do the reading.","Excellent professor. He assigns lots of reading, but it's manageable. He is very good at explaining concepts, clarifying difficult topics, encouraging discussion, etc. Don't let his intimidating Slovakian accent fool you, he tolerates a fair amount of shenanigans as long as y'all stay on track.

Papers topics may as well be written in a foreign language far as much as I understood them.  When I tried to get in touch with Prof. Symes, she was out of town and told me to ask my TA.  I'm not a history major.  This was way too hard for an intro class.","This was the worst class I have ever taken in my life.  If you like history at all, this class will make you hate it.  On the bright side, Prof. Symes seems to really know what she is talking about and is even entertaining once in a while.  Not much in lecture helps with the test.  You are pretty much on your own."

I felt inspired to pursue a career in business intelligence/data mining.,"Prof. Tafti obviously loves his field and knows his stuff. He really cares about helping students understand complex topics.

He decided to change how the class was run in the middle of the semester.  We went from a reasonable amount of work to a couple hours a night.,Boring.  Don't expect to get the grade you want.  Most classes are useless as the textbook or prior knowledge will teach you more than he will.  Tests will be on material not covered in class so be ready.,"This professor decides his own grading scale at the end of the year.  Don't expect a good grade, and is very boring.

She refuses to teach in a linear fashion, so it is impossible to build upon what you are supposed to be learning.  Assigns homework to be completed before she has taught how to do the work.  She creates everything to hear ease and yet won't address the students needs.  Do not take this prof.","Routinely refuses to teach until the last 20 minutes of class so she does not have to deal with questions.

He mostly talks about models copied from old econ txtbks.  There is no txtbk and material is handed out every class period.  Final was open book and identical to the practice exam.  Material wasn't too difficult.  Take the class if you want to bore yourself, do some homework and not learn anything.","I'm convinced he's obsessive-compulsive, which makes him kind of hard to please as far as grading goes.

Other criticisms of her clarityare over-exaggerated. Dr. Telzer would mis-speak from time to time (less than once per lecture on avg) but always corrected herself.","I couldn't stand sitting through her lectures. Her presentation was dry and she stumbled over her speech because she was clearly terrified. Tough grader on the writing with no feedback ever.  Not a hard class, but maybe take something else.","Are you serious? This professor can't even articulate properly in class. It's not like she's foreign either--she's just so nervous and it's pretty obvious. She grades extremely harshly, and writes the exams just to trick students. Material is interesting, but I wish professors had a genuine interest in students' achievement rather than tricking","She's nice. Adolescent development is a good subject. She does expect you to read the assigned readings before class. I suggest doing them on time rather than trying to read them all the night before the exams. 1project, 1 paper, 3 exams and lots of I class activities (participation).","The class just started, but I am already in love with Dr. Telzer!

Only take this course if you can write long papers with ease and know about Russia.,"DO NOT send him an email at the last minute - he checks his email maybe once a week. Also takes a while to grade papers. He is quite intelligent, but tends to ramble! If no one answers his questions - he will call on you.

Rather absent-minded (couldn't follow the syllabus, use technology, or remember the time or his students' names). This was the easiest class I ever took, but I still learned a good amount (about a fun topic!)","Interesting, funny, tends to get off topic a lot and so I can't always follow him in class. Fair and an easy grader. Pleasant guy.",Looks like a mad scientist and is British. How can you go wrong?,Totally hot and a true genius!,"Best Professor I've ever had or known.

I still miss his class since taking it back in 1996 and I still read the books from his classes.  If anyone is thinking about taking his class, listen to me about him:  I thought he was arrogant and stupid before taking the class but afterwards found him to be the best!

She gives vague ""help"" and loves busywork.","She taught us about how to find techniques in writing &amp; then expects us after one class to become the 'expert' in a specific technique &amp; write a paper about it. So its no wonder when you don't get a very good grade on it. She's stoic &amp; unclear on what she wants. I had so many questions about the papers, yet she could never give me clear answers.",Thompson-Spires is ok. She gives TONS of busy work and never really is upfront or clear on anything. It seems like everything she lectures on is more vague and she never gives concrete help. Her mandatory paper conferences are time-wasting because she won't answer your questions and she barely mentions the essay you wrote. She's too vague teaching.,"Definitely has a negative attitude towards undergrads from the get-go and a very overbearing ""I'm smarter than you"" mentality (she's from California after all). She holds mandatory paper conferences before which she will not even read your paper/essay, making the whole meeting/conference a complete waste of your time."

It is not mandatory, and it's easy to doze off, but what he says in lecture, he puts on the test.","This class was extremely hard, I studied for a week for an exam and got a 36/50. 24/68 people have above a c in this class.

However, his tests are all true false and can be rather tricky.

I studied for about 12 hours for the final (not cumulative) and pulled off an A in the class. In my class, an 80% was an A, so the curve is generous. The people who complain about the midterms likely didn't study or read the book and probably didn't attend lecture","Horrible class. Geography 103 is the worst class on the planet. The professor is terrible, do not take this class.","His exams are hard, but he is very easy on the ears.  He can be quite funny and his stories are always good.  Just go to class with the printouts and taking the exams are so much easier.  The lab section is not the most difficult thing in the world either.",In Fall 2008 I took his environmental perspectives class. It was very boring. He required everyone to debate issues which was hard and he constantly threatened to fail people who didn't contribute enough.

Exams definately have some bad questions that you'll only get once in a million years and only by guessing, but Lab portion is a piece of cake and the lectures + his little odd facts here and there are at least somewhat interesting if you have an attention span beyond a 6 year-old."

She walks around asking if you have questions and how you are doing in the class. She shows up to midterms and the final (which not all professors do) to make sure everything is run smoothly. She asks students what office hours times are most convenient for them.,"Terrible professor. Her lecture is totally copied from her note and she is not able to clarify the main point of each lecture, which makes most of the students confused. I attended another professor's lecture in the beginning of the semester and I got a good grade on the first midterm. That's all I do well in this semester.","Professor Tolman has a very scripted style to her lectures that is simply a recitation of the PDF notes she posts online.  This makes some students feel her lectures are optional, but I personally liked the lecture style.  However, asking questions during lecture is difficult unless you make an effort to flag her down.  Straightforward &amp; good prof",She isn't a good lecturer and is only really helpful when you go to her office hours.,very intelligent,She was definitely the worst of the Calc 3 Profs in spring '15,Really hard and dont skip class even though you wont understand a lot by attending class.,"She likes rushing sometimes, I found hard to follow without previewing the textbook. But she is intelligent and is always willing to help. To me, she cares about her students.","Professor Tolman is really smart and knows her stuff, but sometimes struggles to get what she's trying to say out in a way that students understand. A lot of the time, I would leave class confused, and go and read the book for clarification, but she is more than willing to help you during her office hours.","First of all, Calc 3 is not an super-easy class and you should not underestimate it. I can feel that the professor tries her best to explain every concept, but still there are confusions during every lecture. Calc 3 involves three-dimensional drawings and vector fields so people need to spend time practicing. I spend a lot of time reading the book.",Nobody understand anything she says in lecture. She makes already hard Calc 3 much harder than it needs to be!,"can't explain well, does not pronounce clearly and loudly, tough exam and homework and even don't post grading criteria.","She is really intelligent, which is why the information she offers in lectures can be overwhelming. Taking notes while trying to figure out what she is doing is almost impossible, which is her obvious weakness.  But her office hours is worth attending, and she really cares about her students' feedback.","I'd say she's really quirky. As other people have already mentioned, you can see that she knows things, but her lectures are really confusing to understand. When the class went into to the more confusing parts of Calc3, I had to rely on reading textbooks because I just couldn't learn much from the lecture. Exam are easy if you do some practice.",Just wondered why there're no rates appearing when I clicked on the link,"While Prof. Tolman is a bit quirky, she's incredibly intelligent and clearly loves teaching. I would sometimes leave her class a bit confused, but her office hours are great. She focuses on having students find the solution with their ""tool kit"" rather than just having us memorize theorems. A great class and a great experience."
945734,3.5,Claudia,Tomassia,1,0.30318426277121224,"Hard to understand with accent, however, exams are based entirely on class slides and notes. Attendance is taken but also extremely helpful."
1521904,5.0,Christopher,Tomaszewski,1,0.7875106229221756,Fall 2010 Semester. Very good at going over examples in discussion and encouraged class participation. Frequently available during office hours and great at answering questions.
1445309,3.1,Jonathan,Tomkin,16,0.4482712869034696,"Dr. Tomkin's teaching style isn't ordinary college lecturing. He actually engages with the class. You have to watch videos, read passages, and complete quizzes for every module on Moodle. The quizzes are relatively doable if you pay attention to the modules and lectures, and you can retake them as many times. Review modules to do good on the exams.","This class is probably one of the most difficult of the 100 Gen eds. Lecture is interesting, and he knows his stuff, but almost 80% of your grade is based on tests. His tests are extremely difficult and ask questions about things that aren't always in the study guide. Unless you really like rocks or geology is your major, don't take this class.",Tomkin has a unique style of teaching that is different and it grabs your attention. The lectures are meant to get you thinking rather than just sit there and listen.   The exams however are tricky and many of us didn't find out until the very end. The question could be asking something but he really means something else. Look for keywords.,"We only met once a week, which was awesome. Exams are tricky. Content is extremely simple. The professor is nice, funny, and really into the material, but the lectures are required and are 100% pointless. Would be a great course if exams weren't as tricky.","This is probably the most difficult 100 level course.. Way too much detail. I took it as a gen ed, and it really messed up my GPA. We barely did anything in lecture, and there are way too many discussion assignments and homework. Even the extra credit was difficult to earn. There are four exams. Would never recommend it to anyone.","This is supposed to be an easy gen-ed, and with anyone else it is. With Tomkin, not only are the tests really hard they're scheduled at the most inconvenient times like the day after spring break, the last day of class (keep in mind their is also a final). The material may be easy to understand, but this professor loves murky conceptual questions.","In order to succeed in one of Tomkin's classes, you have to understand a few things about him. First, he teaches and gives grades in an Australian style. He is a tough grader and has very high expectations of students. Secondly, he has a hilarious Australian sense of humor and is really helpful if you talk to him and get to know him.","This was a very tough class, especially for a 200 level class. The quizzes were very tricky. I read the texts and took extensive notes, but still struggled with the quizzes.",Tomkin is super smart and his lectures are good. You'll learn a ton of important information. Only problem is that the quizzes were very tricky.,"I decided to take this easy class my senior year: However it was anything but easy. I went to class everyday &amp; took notes along with his terrible notes, &amp; barely managed to pull off a B- (where I received all A's in my 5 other classes). The too-hard exams have nothing to do with anything you learn in class. I highly recommend not to take him.",Tests are way harder than expected. So many people failed that test so he put out review sheets for the other 2 midterms. The questions are too difficult and tricky. review guides only help so much. Class is interactive but don't Have To participate tho. doesn't help in office hours at all! so don't miss a class and expect help.,"He takes this class way too seriously.  I took it with him when it was his first year teaching it.  I assumed he'd teach the class the same way as Altaner did, which through the grapevine was easily.  It's a 100 level geology class, he should realize half the class is there as a blow off.  His tests are more difficult than necessary.  Take Alperin.",Tomkin is really interested in what he teaches and it shows during lectures.  He also involves the class in discussions and activities to make it more interesting.  Tests can either be really easy or kinda tricky... but he's very available and will go over exams or class material with students during office hours.,really bad lecturer. gets all his information from wikipedia. literally. all of it. the tests are very ambiguous but his grading scale is very much not ambiguous. pretty bad overall.,"He is a pretty good professor.  You'll have to get used to the accent but that makes the lectures go by faster. The material is interesting and most of the people taking the class are already interested in the area.  The grade is based on three midterms (20 percent each, lowest dropped), 40 percent on the final, and 20 percent on homework. Yikes.","I like him, he's a pretty good professor but like any class, it can get a little boring. But most everyone who takes this class is already interested in the subject matter, so it shouldn't be a huge problem."

388591,3.4,Ali,Toossi,38,0.504832060198623,"He is a nice person. He tries to help students as much as he can, but Idk I just found the class really boring for some reason. If you are interested in game theory and monopoly, you might be very interested. But for me, I wasn't having fun with the topic and his lectures made me doze off. Also, I hate the fact there is attendance in this class.","Be good with him, get average grade (not too bad lol), attend every classes and you will get A","This class doesn't really have any structure. Toossi kind of floats from one topic to another, most don't really have anything to do with ""coordination"". There are some useful things you can pick up from this class, like complementarity mappings and path dependence, but overall he covers a lot of random material at a very shallow level.","Ok professor, but the material is really outdated. His models are pre-70s, most of which have been empirically disproven. Toossi is also dodges any and all questions. Home and tests are very difficult and there isn't much outside help.  Altogether you will have to work very hard to learn very little.","Tends to speak over you when you're asking him questions in class or during office hours. i.e., he usually doesn't let you finish your question before diving straight into an explanation as if he's lecturing the class again. Makes mistakes on the solutions for the homework and on his own lecture notes which is confusing unless you know about it.",Not good at explaining the course and heavy exams,"I can say that Toossi is not that great of a professor. He will over complicate on simple things and not go into detail of things that need to be analyzed more. The exams are straight forward, but his final exam is bad. Some high point questions are asked of things from post  exam 2 where not much practice for those questions are given.","Well, he is a very kind person overall. However attendance does count, which is pretty rare for a 400 level class. His class wasn't easy to A, but at least a B if you tried to pay attention and do the review before midterm and final. There is only one midterm and a final for this course.","Professor Toossi is a great professor. His exams are difficult, he requires attendance, and has required homeworks each week. Tough dude, but you learn A LOT",good professor,"Really good professor, one of the best ever!!! very clear explanation! cute accent?I got an A in this class. You can really learn something useful in this class.","He is the best prof. I have met ever!!! Choose him, really easy A, pretty easy A class. Attendance is not mandatory, 80% students will get an A or A+ in his class, Choose his Econ303 especially",One of the better macro/micro econ professors at UIUC.,He is one of the best professors i had in UIUC !,Professor Toossi is the best.,"Everyone goes crazy about how hard 302 is. It is definitely not easy, but it's not so difficult that you need to take it off-campus. Weekly homeworks take a LONG time, but they help you learn the material, especially the ""additional problems"" because they are exactly like problems on the exam. Def not easiest among 302s, but Toossi is a good prof","He might not explain thing quite well sometimes, but as long as you read the textbook carefully, you'll be fine. Midterm was easy, final was a bit harder. Still, reading the textbook is really helpful. It is surely not the easiest inside 302s, but you can learn something from this class.","Nice guy, but it seems like no matter who you take, ECON 302 is just ridiculously difficult.  Grades were based on 2 exams and weekly homework (with around 10 questions each week).  He'll give you the answers if you go to office hours, but it won't help you for the tests.  If you can, I recommend taking 302 at a community college...","Toossi is one of the better professors for 302. He teaches right from the book for the most part. Homeworks are kinda hard, but if you ask him in class or office hours he'll pretty much give you the answers.",Great prof!

Seemed uninterested.","Quite possibly the most miserable class experience I've ever had.  JT assigned papers before every class, then during class, regurgitated the contents of these papers.  No new information was actually delivered that was not in the papers.  EXTREMELLY unhelpful and unsupportive.  Dismissive of student ideas and proposals.  Very arrogant.",He knows his stuff..

Repeatedly making announcements on how important her GenEd class is.  Give the feedbacks of Week 2 work on Week 5.... Therefore, gave you no choice to correct the same mistake on week 3, 4 and 5. First Gened class I ever dropped at U of I. Avoid this instructor!"
188249,2.9,Dan,Tortorelli,31,0.3446523921448972,"Content is straight forward. Exams are similar to the h/w. In terms of actually learning and gaining information from the class, I would rate Prof. Tortorelli VERY low. Teaching style is reminiscent of a bad HS teacher - just regurgitating the required content. Appears to have a very low EQ and thus struggles to adjust or interpret situations.",He is a good professor in general. His lectures are kind of boring but there are iclicker points so I would encourage you all to go. The class has a lot of homework that is hard in my opinion. Exams can get a bit challenging.,"The worst professor I ever had.  Dry teaching style.  Unfortunately, it really just seems like he isn't very smart and as a result he has no ability to adjust his teaching style.  Professors like him are why ME at U of I will always be second rate.  Which is a shame because they are some really top notch professors there.",Tortorelli knows what he's talking about and attempts to make that as clear as possible through his in-class examples. He records all of his lectures  and he is there to help with anything you need during office hours. He is incredibly patient. He also sounds exactly like Norm MacDonald... just sayin'.,"He's a dry lecturer, but he really knows what he's doing. Sometimes his sense of humor is hilarious, but it's hard to pay attention in his class.","Really wasn't a fan. His lectures were among the most dry and dull that I've seen out there, and following the material (or even trying to) proved to be very difficult for me. That may be in part due to the nature of the class itself, but he certainly did nothing to contribute positively to me.","I don't see what everybody's complaining about. The class was tough, but he def didn't make it worse. He used smartphysics for the hw which was great and gave a lot of opportunities for extra credit. The hw was about 10x harder than the tests and took HOURS (but at least it's not the other way around). Best example I've seen of an AVERAGE professor","Finite Element Analysis. Very hard class, homeworks and computer problems took many hours each week, exam was open book though.","The homework was ridiculous (At least 8 hours a week), but he does a ton of examples in lecture and the exams weren't too bad.","The material was not difficult, just EXTREMELY boring. He was a good professor - he taught exactly what he tested us on. The homework was brutal - took at least 6 hours a week.",He sounds exactly like Norm Mcdonald.,"He does tons of examples.  It might be hard to get used to his style and notation, but once you do he is pretty helpful.  There is way too much homework for the credit given, but the exams were not hard at all.","Presents example problems well and is very helpful in office hours. My one problem with lectures is that his derivations didn't help my understanding one bit. Exams were much easier than in past semesters. Way too much homework though. When the homeworks got more difficult, I spend about 2 to 3 hours each set.","One of those teachers that knows what he's talking about, but can't connect it to students. Everything is theoretical and he spends more time deriving equations than explaining how to use them. Online homework is very poorly set up w/ mistakes half the time and the tests were nothing like the homework or anything in class.",Smart guy. lectures not needed if you read the book. TA's go to the help sessions so if they're decent enough there's no need to go to him directly. Not too bad if you put the work in.,Worst professor EVER. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. It is quite clear that he could really care less about teaching/his students.,"He reminds me of David Hasselhof.  Good teacher, horrible class, mostly due to textbook.",He was alright at the beginning of the semester bc the material was fairly easy. But once the class got harder all he did was give us examples but never really set any general guidelines on HOW to solve a problem. Problems on exams were chosen from a long list so studying just meant memorizing every problem. Needs to learn to teach more effectively,Great teacher. Good guy. Cares about his students.,"This guy is obviously very smart, but he can't teach for anything.  You can understand what he's saying (no accent or anything) but he's terrible at explaining things."

In the later case,, he would just go to his office room and we could hardly learn anything from him","Exams did *not* accurately reflect material taught in class, nor the textbook(s).
