She also has a great sense of humor, as we talked about lots of controversial things in our Greek comedy class and she laughed with the rest of us.

I didn't do so well because I never studied the vocab, other than that she is very fair and not too hard.",A great professor!

The confusing lecture with esoteric readings might be the only resource you can resort to in order to deal with the next-level exam.","She seems like a nice person, but her teaching was rough. Her lectures were confusing and the readings were difficult to follow. The listening examples were hard for everyone, including those with musical backgrounds. It just seemed like no one knew what was going on or what was expected of them.","Not good. Demonstrated little control over the class, gave incredibly unorganized and un-detailed lectures, and never clearly explained course content or assignments. Did not seem prepared for lectures, or interested in being there. Nice woman, but should not be in charge of such a large class. Was recommended this class, severely disappointed.","Do not take anything she teaches. Her grading expectations are ridiculous, especially since she doesn't even teach anything in class. Half of the class is spent by her yelling at people to put their laptops away, or trying to get people to participate in a large lecture. She is not a good professor and tries to make the course hard on purpose.","This class is way more difficult than it needs to be, especially since so many people take it as a gen ed. She publicly calls people out in lecture for talking, yells at people for using laptops to take notes, and then tries to get people to participate in a large lecture. The lectures are boring, there is not a ton of graded material. Good luck.","Class is meant to be World Music, but you don't really spend time on music material. It should maybe be called World Performance instead, as that is the focus for a large part of the class. Little graded material, just 2 exams, 2 papers, 2 journals, and some extra credit. Weird iClicker questions. She's a nice lady, but poor course structure.","Easily the worst professor I've ever had. She got through about 5 of 20 lecture slides every week and her exams were terrible. For example, there were multiple questions that specifically ask for 2 examples of something. Then when we get them back we find out that she actually wanted 4 examples and didn't give any credit to those who gave 2 example"

He also thinks his homework is ""easy,"" yet when I went to his office hours, it seems he struggled on figuring out his own homework problems.

She always has clever ways to explain material and is super honest about how she understood things when she was a grad student. She also hates giving tests, so take an upper level grad class where she isn't forced to give them. The only hard part is homework, which you present and is graded by a TA","Prof. Tserunyan is an awesome lecturer. While every so often she may make a mistake in a proof, she always makes sure that everybody knows where the mistake was and what it was so as to clear up any confusion. She always brings a bit of humor to her lectures and is always open to questions.","Anush is likely the best lecturer I've ever had. She explains the motivation behind definitions and theorems, gives illustrations to help you understand new concepts and organizes things in a logical manner. She is very responsive to student questions and her deconfussion sessions are also helpful. Would take another class with her in a heartbeat!",Anush's class was an amazing introduction to logic. I feel like several new horizons have opened up. The problem sessions were a helpful addition to the course.,"Anush is a very helpful and thoughtful instructor. She is willing to answer any questions you might have through email or in person. Homework is generally harder than what is tested. There are designated ""deconfusion sessions"" where you can come in and ask about any problem on the homework. Overall, I strongly reccommend her.",It was a nice class with Anush. She is just as awesome. Good researcher and good lecturer. Explains everything in a way that everyone in the class can follow her.,"Amazing, she is one of the best lecturers I've ever seen.",Bad,"About as good at teaching linear algebra as a raving homeless man living beneath the L tracks in Englewood. Inscrutable handwriting, slapdash lecture presentation, inconsistent office hours, treats all questioning as disrespect, homework doesn't match lecture content, doesn't even write solution sets to her own midterm prep questions! Avoid. Avoid.","WORST TEACHER EVER! She tries but is not a good teacher. Her section is much for difficult, much more intensive than all other sections. I feel that I'm not even in linear algebra. She writes very small and does't communicate what she is trying to say. She is too lazy to put up lecture notes or even give the answer key to practice problems. Avoid.","She is terrible, every comment on here is the truth. Doesnt even care about her students, avoid at all costs",Worest teacher!!!! I don't think she even understands that we have more than her classes. I feel like she explects us to be a mathematician on day 1. Don't just try to avoid her. Do avoid her. She is soooooo bad!!!!!!,By far the WORST professor I have ever had since attending U of I. I don't recommend her to anyone. Avoid her class unless you want to be tested on abstract linear algebra.,"I saw my midterm grade was 60 and I wanted to suicide. Right before I did that, I found out that the average score was 56. Thanks Anush for saving my life.","Holy crap, this prof is worse than TA. Even i could teach better than her. No answer to homework or practice problem and the reason is she has no time to write, LMAO. Never care about students and no willing to help. Avoid it or welcome to hell.",AVOID THIS SECTION. She is the worst professor I have ever met in UIUC. There is no solution for any hand-in homework. Her lecture is boring and helpless. And the exam is hard and ridiculous. Also there is no solution for practice exam simply because she have no time to write it.,"AVOID her class at all cost! Her explanations are extremely lost and it is very easy to get lost in her class. Less than half of the class attend her class and half of that are not even listening to her. Exams are ridiculous and there are no curves for individual exams. This is applied linear algebra, but she makes it seem so abstract.","IF YOU ARE CLEVER ENOUGH TO READ THIS, AVOID HER. Anush is certainly a smart and nice teacher, BUT she doesnt teaches her staff right. Her lectures are useless and boring. Her midterms dont relates on what the textbook materials. I haven't felt so bad about a math class in my life. Studying anything before midterms is useless for her classes. AVOID",It seems that she cares nothing about her students. Lectures go too fast and has no patience for answering questions. Try to avoid her as much as possible.,One of the worest professor. Classes go way too fast. Never pauses her class for questions. Lecture for 50 minutes straight. Unorganized blackboard writing and illegible letters. She thinks the average of the class grade should match the understanding of a person who is confused by the main concepts of this class. Who the hell does this?????

He really knows how to explain things clearly to students who don't understand. Plus he is GORGEOUS! Oh wow, what a man! I'll never forget this class, it improved my German, and showed me the most beautiful man on Earth!","this class is an advanced comp so it has a TON of reading &amp; writing. 2 papers (where you get a rewrite) 2 exams &amp; a term paper. weekly responses to readings aren't mandatory but they go towards your participation grade. attendance not mandatory but he doesn't put notes online. he talks a lot, it gets tiresome.",this class is a ton of work but if you do the readings the tests are a joke.  the papers are easy to get a good grade on. just do the readings and you'll be fine,"I took this class to fulfill the advanced comp gen ed. DO NOT TAKE IT! take english 109! the amount of writing is beyond ridiculous. i had taken this class because i thought the Holocaust would make the papers a bit more interesting. i was wrong. if you do not want to have a life for the semester, take this class. i want to die.","I didn't do any of the readings and didn't take notes in class and still got an A, but he is literally the most boring professor I've ever had.","He is definitely a great teacher and everything he teaches is really worth knowing. He shows that he is interested in teaching the material to the class, so as long as you take his notes and do the readings, getting a ""A"" isn't hard at all. Take this class!",Probably one of the worst teachers I've ever had.. the class could have been taught in English and the majority of the class still would have been confused all the time.,"I also took this for an adv. comp. He is really enthusiastic during lectures and engages the class. The readings were eye opening and the TA's (I had Kurt) were extremely helpful. I felt like I greatly improved my writing in this class. Its challenging, but the reward is definitely worth it and it isn't hard to get an A","Wonderful teacher.

Seems very intelligent, but doesn't know how to explain the material to peeons.","This man is boring.  He mumbles.

If you have chances to switch another section, go for it.","Doesn't teach out of the textbook assigned, not to mention the textbook is horrible at showing steps and giving clear explanations for problems.  Usually gives quiz and  test questions that require a ""deeper understanding"" of the concepts of the chapter which aren't entirely covered in the homework.  However, he is an easy grader of homework.","Tumanov quite simply cannot lecture. About halfway through the semester, I attended class but stopped paying attention. His accent makes him hard to understand not that without it, he'd be able to lecture well anyway. If you do the homework and study you will do well, but with a different prof, that level of work would be a letter grade higher.","You don't learn much from Tumanov as his explanations aren't great and he has a hard to understand accent. In addition to this, the book isn't exactly all that clear either. If you do end up taking this class, prepare to learn how to solve a specific problem for an exam rather than properly understanding the concepts. Generous curve though.",A professor of absolutely appalling quality. I learnt nothing from the course. He was incomprehensible with a heavy accent. Attendance was horrible-no one showed up. TA's were not helpful. No extra credit despite numerous requests.. and exams of unpredictable difficulty. Overall Fail.,"nice man, available for help. homework and quizzes every week. exams weren't too bad, and the grade curve was generous","Nice person, available for help. homework and quizzes every week. exams weren't too bad and the grade curve was generous","one of the worst teacher one can have. Doesn't really speak English, and doesn't know how to teach either. No one ever goes to his lecture, you have to teach yourself. Exams are not that bad, have to do the previous exams","He did poor job explaining the theory and he jumped a lot. However, his grading is pretty fair, and he almost tells us every problem on the test, so grade is not a problem. If you review the stuff after each class and make sure you get everything on the homework, then A is in your pocket.My little tip is: find an excellent study buddy!That helps me","You get used to the accent but that doesn't help the fact that when you ask him questions he doesn't understand and answers something else. In lecture he didn't use enough examples and does way too much proof which made the hw extremely hard. However, he gives reasonable tests and lots of partial credit! Very fair exams","Cool accent, nice guy, available for help, not a very good teacher because he usually doesn't use good examples (just proofs). I took Math 241 Honors and he told us wat questions were gonna be on each test. Start the hw early and you should be fine","HORRIBLE professor. Most math professors here are bad but I've never been so confused in a subject like with him. lecture was pointless he just outlined the book, my ta was also bad and a hard grader. test averages have been ~65%, homework is ridiculous along with quizzes and the book does not help any, moral of the story FIND A DIFFERENT PROFESSOR","Tumanov is your average UIUC math professor; and by average I mean bad at teaching, and foreign with a thick accent. That being a said, the accent is not impossible; my advice is to take a seat front and center. The lectures have too many proofs and not enough well explained examples. The tests are difficult, but not impossible.","Good solid professor. Much better choice than the other professor(s) on campus. Calculus is difficult, there's no way around it, but he's very clear in examples and extremely thorough. Exams are not too difficult if you keep up with the hw and quizzes. Hw never due, but necessary to succeed.","Major beef is that he is extremely hard to understand. It honestly took me 3 weeks to get used to his accent. Meanwhile I had to study primarily from the book just to keep my head above water. He obviously knows his stuff, but teaches like he's the only one in the room, usually ignoring raised hands. Avoid if possible.","Isn't really too hard to understand, and if you pay close attention in class the material becomes more coherent. He gives very difficult quizzes and tests, but there is a steep curve on final grades. Go to class for the examples but study the concepts from the book before hand.","He isn't very helpful, seems quite apathetic toward his students, and speaks in a funky accent.","god awful. Doesn't know how to teach, and have a VERY strong accent. If you'd like to ACTUALLY learn math , I suggest you drop the minute you get in there. I regret I haven't chekced this before hand.","Hard to understand, and not just because of accent/mediocre command of English language.  NOT good at explaining/teaching.

He attempts to prove theorems in the chapter he wants you to look at, but if he gets stuck he just kind of stares at it for a while, scratchs his head, and says something along the lines of ""well, you get the picture.""  I do not recommend.","Though cloaked in an air of mystery &amp; intrigue, Prof. Tumanov is a approachable &amp; amiable man who frequently cracks jokes during lecture (listen carefully) &amp; sports a stylish pair of sunglasses.  The textbook was an integral part of  his class &amp; one could derive a feel for exam questions from the examples he gave.  Any Jane Austen fan would approve","Enjoyable to attend lectures - he has a quirky sense of humor. That having been said, his tests are quite rigorous, maybe a bit too rigorous. I think this is not exclusive to this particular teacher, but if you fall behind it is nearly impossible to get back up to speed...",Difficult and unintelligible,DONT EVER TAKE THIS CLASS!,"This man is tough. Even though the average of the final was a 46%, he still barely had a curve on the class. He seems like he truly doesn't care about any of the students. He's also hard to understand.",Never before had I gotten the feeling that a teacher was doing me a favor by passing me. Was he testing how much of the subject i learned or how much of it i could do on his level? I'll never know. HW solutions he provided routinely said 'this is trivial; you should know how to do this.' I wonder what happens when i try that one on his tests.

And if the test is open book, forget about it, super hard.",Above Average,He is not bad. He knows what he is talking about. I do not know why everyone hates him so much. Give him a break. Any professor would seem bad after you have had Dan Work for the first half of the class.,"Lectures are pretty boring; just reads off ppt slides, throws in a few anecdotes. The lecture slides could have been more useful in doing the homework. Exams were a bit long, but open book open note. Overall good class.","He was fine; not great but not terrible.  Basically just reads off the powerpoint slides, but he def knows what he's talking about.  I dunno why everyone says he keeps them late; we got let out on time every single day.","Unbelievable... He is the only prof. I've ever had that runs class past the bell every single lecture.  He is totally unapologetic about it too.  In fact, he gets angry when people leave a minute or two after the bell.  His exams are easy and the homework is easy (when it isn't so blurry from being copied so many times that you can't read it.)",Awful.  Lets class out late every single lecture.  Every. single. time.  Then he whines when people try to leave at the bell.,"He runs over every single lecture then he complains when people want to leave.  He has made me late for an exam because he started yelling at me when I tried to leave 2 minutes after the bell.  He knows what he's talking about, but he is very very boring and he doesn't work for the student at all.  The homeworks he assigns are unreadable."

839078,3.2,Brendesha,Tynes,11,0.5695905813349973,I absolutely loved Professor Tynes GESM131 class on African American  Child Development is substance filled. She is very knowledgeable on this subject and is passionate about it so she has no problem helping with assignments. She makes the bulk of material very comprehensible and fun.,"She's a great teacher. She knows her stuff and she genuinely cares about her students. She's always open to constructive criticism. You're going to be challenged in this class, but ideologically, not academically. If you're prepared for that, you'll love this course.",This professor is terrible! She doesn't have a clue as to how to teach a class. Her classes are boring with no structure and all she does it talk about what she studied and researched in her studies. The class is just all over the place with absolutely no organization. DON'T TAKE HER! It will drive you insane!,"Psychology of the African American was based entirely on  Dr Tynes' view of race.  Ideas   with which she did not agree were not tolerated or even presented.  Even the required textbook for the class was written and edited by her.  If a white professor taught black stereotypes the way she teaches based on white stereotypes, he or she would be fired",Professor Tynes clearly cares very much for her students and worked to create a learning environment conducive to the somewhat tough subjects discussed. She really earned our respect for how hard she worked and cared for us.  The class content (Psychology of the African American Child) was information that I think all people need to learn about.,Dr. Tynes teaches this course on early adolescent development with themes centering on education and psychology. You'll also examine how external factors like sex/gender/race/socioeconomic status impact psychological development. This course raises important issues. Tynes is open to student feedback and teaches with enthusiasm. You'll learn a lot.,Dr. Tynes is a wonderful professor and role model.  You'll learn so much from taking her class!,Dr. Tynes is tough but good. I don't know what these other people's problems were. I thought she was pretty good.,"I agree, this professor made many out of line comments to a large class.  Future teachers generally don't want to hurt their students or believe that students are incapable because of their gender, race, or economic status, but Professor Tynes had no faith in our abilities and genuine interests in improving lives of all of our students.","This woman is possibly the dumbest woman in the great state of Illinois. Everything was about race with her. Apparently Ph.D.'s from UCLA are as valuable as toilet paper. She told a lecture hall full of hundreds of future teachers that public school teachers send kids to prison. If she isn't fired, it will be a disgrace.","The fact that Brendesha Tynes was hired here single handedly discredits the fine University of Illinois.  Without a doubt, the worst teacher in the history of education."

The 3 midterms are hard but the final is all multiple choice. The worksheets are confusing and the weekly homework takes forever. Its an engineering class so be ready for a challege.,"I absolutely loveee Professor Tyson. He was extremely enthusiastic and knowledgable about his class. I found that he did tend to overcomplicate simple topics a times, espeially with foreign notation, but overall the curve made the class doable.","Extremely fantastic professor!!

He is the optimal professor for a difficult class. Side note: Love his sweaters like everyone else is saying lol","Professor Tyson is really smart and fashionable. Beautiful sweaters, I agree :D I really like the way he's being responsive and helpful all the time. I like the way he looks around to see whether there are hands up for questions during lectures. And he holds so many office hours! Be sure to take advantage of his teaching style and helpfulness :)","Professor Tyson is extremely clear during lectures and will always make time outside of class to help you if you're struggling. The material is quite difficult, but he explains it in a way that makes sense (and uses lots of pictures). He tests understanding rather than rote memorization. Also, the notation near the end is terrible. Amazing class!","Prof. Tyson is an awesome guy. He moves quickly and writes a lot on the board, however he is very willing to answer any questions. He seems like an odd guy but throughout the semester you learn that he's actually pretty funny. Class is tough, exams are hard, but nothing to be afraid of; the instructors do their best to prepare you.","Tyson was very clear in his explanations and was a general pleasure as a lecturer, not to mention his adorable sweaters. If you pay attention in his class, you will definitely learn a lot.",He was an awesome professor. He took times to explain things clearly and he made sure to answer all questions. He also wrote everything down on the board which was helpful. He made sure to challenge students who understood coursework and made sure to clarify for students who did not understand.,"Professor Tyson is great! He's got a sexy sweater collection, so I suggest you take his course in the fall so you can see him show them off. He really works the sweater/khaki combination. Oh yeah, and he teaches well too.",Smart but a little too fast.,"Prof. Tyson was great! He was teaching really efficiently. As far as I know, he is not teaching any undergrad course in spring11. I say the course was hard because I knew nothing about linear algebra before enrolling the course.","Very difficult class, but if you are willing to go to office hours professor Tyson is very willing to provide assistance.",No Comments,a very good professor. very skilled in teaching and you can see easily that he is passionate about math. like his class very much

She means well but she just can't teach efficiently. It's hard to be motivated to do well in a language class with a prof. who is present-absent.,"She's a very nice lady but not a very good professor. She shows up late EVERYDAY but still manages to have her coffee... She is often unprepared, behind schedule and never enters grades. She is very frustrating.","I love her! She is one of the nicest, most fair professors I have ever had. She truly has an interest in what she is teaching and it shows. Textbook is unnecessary, she puts the readings online. I would absolutely take another class with her and highly recommend this one.","Class can get boring, but she's an interesting professor! Do not take this class if you are not interested in the subject (Sex and Gender in Antiquity). Put in some effort and you will get an A.",Going to class is mandatory and super boring. Never paid attention. The three papers are easy to write (wrote them all a day before their deadlines) and studying for the midterm and final were easy. she literally told you everything you needed to know. It's like she wants everyone to get an A in her class.,"She is a very boring lecturer everyone falls asleep during class. We use i-clickers every class so attendance is pretty much mandatory. Its hard to keep up with some of the material because there's so much. There are 2 writing assignments(2-3 pages), 1 paper (5-7 pages) and 2 exams. She grades pretty easy on the papers. Don't bother buying the text","Super nice and passionate about what she teaches. However she is a super dry lecturer and sometimes it is hard to understand what she is saying. As long as you pay attention in class and take good notes, you don't really ever need to use the textbook. She curves the tests a lot, and you regularly use iclickers so be prepared for that too","Prof. Tzanetou is an excellent professor, passionate in what she teaches, and is an extremely nice person! Truly listens to your issues/questions and only gets upset if you don't listen/talk in class/ask the same question multiple times. Make sure you go to lecture! You get points for that plus she goes over topics &amp; details that are on tests.","She was very knowledgable in the topics covered during the class.  Class was mainly about Greeks and Romans and covered everything ranging from religious festivals to Spartan war customs. She's very helpful and provides study guides for the two exams.  Additionally, class was very reasonable; however, reading the text is necessary.","Prof Tzanetou is a great professor: she's very knowledgeable but also very friendly. She loves to interact with the class about both class-related and non-class-related matters. As a native Greek speaker, she naturally understands the Greek language (in my opinion better than most other professors) &amp; she has studied all the stages of the language.",I really enjoyed this class even though it wasn't something I was interested in. Great professor!,One of the best and most helpful professors I've encountered so far.  She is always willing to discuss grades and concerns.  She has the fairest grading procedures and really encourages students to do their best.  Her energy and obvious expertise is evident and truly makes the class enjoyable.

Gets angry and defensive during lecture if you ask any questions (especially ""dumb"" one","Goes through lectures extremely quickly while leaving students confused and lost. You NEED to go to office hours and study the book a lot. Teacher expects you to understand the basics rather than teaching the basics. Was told this class was a blow-off class, but it is definitely not. Requires lots of work inside and outside of class. Don't reccome","Engineering student for Math553 PDE here please, 1st, are you familiar with lebesgue convergence theorem, n-dimension sphere surface area and many other concepts in functional analysis?  if not, forget about this course. 2nd, you care about why the solution to a PDE exists and why it's unique rather than how to solve it?  if not, forget about it.","Dr. Tzirakis is an amazing professor who loves the material he teaches. It is very difficult to make ordinary differential equations interesting, but his lectures and applications make the course (while more abstract than MATH 285) much more useful. Take the course with him.","He is a great Professor, knows the material very well, approachable, nice person!! A lot of HWs!! good grading , very hard","Friendly personality. Not arrogant like some higher level professors. Likes to lecture without looking too closely at notes so he'll make a few mistakes, but takes student corrections well. Has an accent but easy to understand after a few classes. Explained concepts well. Tests were very straightforward and similar to homework and study guide.","Good professor. His questions come straight from homework. His grading was fair, and he tried to help the student out frequently.",Pretty easy class. Exams are only a few problems so make sure you know how to do everything on the study guide as well as covered in the homework. Not the best partial credit either. He doesn't try to mess you up. He's just making sure you know the material that he taught. Many 100's were achieved on exams in my class.,"He's a nice guy. His exams are on study guides and homework.

Leaves you in a state of unknowing the whole semester.,"I am the first one to use video lectures. It was painful for me to keep up with the lectures especially when exams came around. he grades very harsh but we had easier exams than previous semesters. nonetheless, DO prepare for this class!","Teaches a lot of material that is difficult to understand, but if you go to class and actively participate/take notes/ask questions you will do fine.

He covers material well but if you don't understand he is always helpful in office hours.",He explains things really clear. And he is very nice about the test.,"His lectures are a little confusing and it's hard to pay attention. The exam questions are mostly from the textbook, so study from that. He is most helpful in office hours and he really does try to help you out if you're lost. Also, he didn't ask any physicsword-problems on exams all semester, but he then asked a few on the final exam. Not cool.","I believe his tests are just as easy as last years tbh. You need to study to do well in the class. When he hands back exams, there is always a 50% of the class who failed and a 50% of the class who got an A. All questions in the exams are in the book, so use that to study. His lectures are hard to pay attention in. However, he is very open to help.","Moves quickly through the material. Exams are 90% of the final grade, and are much more difficult than what previous reviewers had (except midterm 1). The book is not helpful, and it won't prepare you enough for the recent examsnothing will. Some mistakes? RIP gradeGPA. May the odds be ever in your favor like the Fourier series of some functions.","It was sometimes hard to sit through his lectures, but his exams were fair.

She gives the class a better understanding of The Constitution and the Supreme Court Cases that shape our current law.  Excellent professor.","I took her Separation of Powers class. I thought this class would be hard at first (especially when we went into game theory) but it wasn't as bad as I expected. Her slides are clear and concise-no extra bs.

The material is hard (as expected) and it may be easy to fall behind If you don't do the homework or go to office hours. His best feature is the clarity of his explanations of complicated topics.,"Caglar was super helpful, he puts tons of office hours and he is willing to help.

If you are good at selflearning you can choose her class. She didn't explain anything and the lectures are not helpful at all.,great teacher! exams very easy and she is really helpful. final exam covers all the material but after one semester you are able to understand everything. i would definitely recommend her!

There were always pauses, like he expected the class to answer one of his (what we considered) rhetorical questions. The first exam was nothing like the practice ones but the next few were more ""fair,"" but many questions still seemed ambiguous.  I can't recommend him as a professor.","This guy had no clue what he was doing w/ his demos. Also his tests were quite hard, and had subject matter that we didn't even learn. Find someone else",dude does not know how to teach his demos dont work and his test are ridiculous,do not take this class w/him.  He gives hard tests!,"He seems a little nerdy and he's not that great of lecturer because he has odd pauses and sometimes his demos don't work, but he seems to be a genuinely nice guy, exams are on the tough side, but they are scaled so it's not too bad."

Makes sure you learn a lot.",His lecture is super boring and you have to write everything he wrote on the board because there is no lecture notes or any other things u can use to study. HWs are super duper hard.,"Homeworks are hard but graded nicely. As long as you go to class and participate you will do fine but make sure you're not caught not paying attention because he will call you out and ask you questions specifically. ""Have you been reading your notes?""",The best professor!,"Amazing professor; don't let the sheer amount of work cloud your judgement. He prefers writing on the board old-school style. If you take good notes, you shouldn't need a textbook. But if you skip a single lecture, you will fall behind. He was very helpful in office hours (which you WILL need). Be ready to work hard and with other classmates.","smart,clear and the best.",Awesome Professor. He'll work you hard but you learn an amazing amount.,"Overall, a very nice guy. He definitely shows his interest in teaching the subject. The material can be hard at times, but he does his best to teach everything thoroughly. He is also very helpful in answering questions.

She is the absolute worst teacher I have ever had in my life. Someone has to file a report on her because she is unfair. I am glad that I am not a senior but for those friends of mine in class about to graduate, she has made it the worst semester for them.","Honestly, she's strict because she cares. She lives in a career surrounded by scholars and she's come a long way herself. Many think she's the worst because she's unclear or whatever, but if something is unclear, it's because you aren't doing the readings, and if it is still unclear, she's very accessible for office hours. She can be very rude tho.","By far the worst teacher I have ever had at this University. So condescending, unhelpful, and unpleasant in general.","Very tough grader, unfair as well, not helpful at all.",Make sure you go to office hours because the lectures are confusing. Also make sure you do the readings. They are long but it helps to know information,"The absolute worst teacher educator I've ever had since Kindergarten. After graduating, I will look back on the years I was a student and remember that the worst teacher I ever had was Prof. Valdivia.   Would not recommend. Can't believe she's actually a teacher.","Worst professor ever, she was unclear about the content, and does not have a comprehensive rubric when grading.",She can be very condescending and disrespectful. Reading the textbooks is definitely a must in order to do the homework assignments and pass the tests.,Worst professor in my 4 years here. She was unclear and incredibly unfair. She tries to make a 100 level course much harder than it needs to be. You HAVE to purchase the books. You can't miss lecture. Annoying group project.  TA's walk up &amp; down stairs to stop you from texting. Iclickers &amp; assignments make no sense. Have to agree with her OPINIONS,She is the worst educator I have ever had.  MACS100 was supposed to be an easy class and she made it awful.  I clickers are required in every lecture and you only get points if you can answer her terribly worded and confusing questions.  No phones or laptops during her pointless lectures.  Homeworks due within 24 hours. the movies shown are awful.,This has been one of the worst professors ive had at U of I (if you can actually call her a professor). Her grading and the overall class is unclear. Also she doesn't let you use phones or any technology in class so overall this class was terrible.,Don't take this class with this professor. Gives quizzesassignments that are due at midnight on the same day. Unclear questions which force certain opinions on the students. This class also forces you to buy two books. Without the books you will be chased out of the lecture theatre during the book quizzes.,Professor whose thought process seems to reflect the way this class is run -- completely disorganized. Material is often contradictory and matters (both administrative and academic) are not dealt with fairly.,Hands down worst teacher I've had on this campus. Would not recommend her to anyone,The worst teacher I have ever had. Incapable of writing coherent questions or forming coherent ideas. She once provided her own definitions of vertical and horizontal integration that was academically wrong. Do not take a class with this professor if you would like to learn anything except how to recognize ineptitude.,"Horrible Teacher with Terrible policies. Book, written by teacher herself, had many mistakes in it. Syllabus was loosely followed and not very transparent.",Absolutely the worst prof in U of I...The only prof I know who requires a certain percentage of fail in the class.People either drop or failed for this class.Don't take it!Confusing and doesn't learn anything from here.She's trying to be funny but in fact she's pretty lame.,I thought that she was very helpful outside of class but sometimes a bit confusing during the class. If you pay attention and do the readings you should be fine.,"The class consists of her spouting out vague, abstract concepts, while you sit there wondering why you are there (You are there because of pop quizzes). Every once in a while it will be enjoyable, but overall, it's a confusing, boring class.","Professor Valdivia is honestly the worst professor I have ever had at UIUC. She has no regards for anyone but her self. Her midterm was poorly written. She has no respect for her TAs, either. I did not learn anything in this course! She does not have the qualifications to be teaching at our fine institute."

I think he's especially great if you have a penchant for theoretical excursions.  But he's not going to hold your hand, and don't expect help unless you ask for it in person.","Entire class based on 15 page final paper, which had no prompt or guidelines assigned, and made no comments on grading.  Very knowledgeable in content area, but very poor teacher in small classroom setting.","I think he is a decent professor for English Honors courses, particularly for Irish literature etc. But our grade was essentially based on a 15-20 page paper, despite the fact that we had ""participation"" and ""presentation"" grades...a little spastic and definitely NOT organized. Very knowledgeable though.","I loved his lectures. He was always prepared and lectured for exactly as long as he said he would. However, this guy is a PROFESSOR. Meaning he won't talk down to you and he sure as hell won't go out of his way to help you.

Be prepared for test questions regarding character's eye color, names of streets, songs, etc.",He was a bad teacher and was very unfair.,"I hated this class.  He didn't test on themes or anything, but small minor details.  I emailed him for help several times with no replies.  The TAs weren't at all helpful either.  He looked like a joke and this class was a joke.","His lectures, while interesting, are extraordinarily obtuse. His appearance, however, is one I hope to replicate someday.  His exams are ridiculous: they test the limits of your capacity for remembering minutia and little else.","He's really eccentric, and while his lectures typically last an hour, I rarely look at the clock.  This class is extremely easy as long as you read and attend lecture (light reading load as compared to other English courses).","I found his lectures really interesting and I've found that if you go to lecture the tests are actually really easy.  Plus, I mean the guy is an AWESOME dresser, the powder blue suit coat with the bomber jacket over it and a yankees baseball cap that is removed to reveal a truely beautiful combover.","Professor Valente will NOT see you.  When this dude walked into class the first day, I was like, what's the janitor doing here?","I love the lectures.  They offer a ton of insight.  The grading is ridiculous though.  He gives tests that, instead of consisting of essays that test our understanding of the stories, has questions about random facts from the stories. Still, if you don't mind the stupid grading, it's a good class.","This guy is crazy.  He doesnt even understand the stories himself, let alone getting us to.",At least he thinks he's giving us easy exams.

He makes funny jokes and narrate anecdotes, they kept the mood of the classroom lively and entertaining.  Lectures were very thorough given the fact that there were so much material to cover in a short amount of time.",By far my favorite professor yet. I really hate to see him leave UIUC  because I was hoping to sign up for his calc II class again. Everything in the class was pretty much perfect and made calculus very enjoyable.,"The biggest advantage to Validashti's class is his tests. Unlike the horror stories I hear from classmates about their tests, the tests are very fair and straightforward. Take notes at lectures and do the practice tests that he sends you and you should get at least a B. People with AP credit will still find this course as a nice refresher.","Validashti is the man. He's the funniest professor I've had and his jokes are on point. However, I'm not a great math student and I felt calc was my hardest freshman course. He teaches at a really fast pace, and be prepared to learn.",This guy was the man.  He was pretty funny and his class was super easy.  I never went and got a 96 on the final.  Would've gotten an A for sure but I never went,Great,"Overall, I thought the class was great. Some of the concepts covered in this course were the ones that I had struggled with before, but the way in which the material were presented made it clear and engaging, and I feel very comfortable with the concepts now and feel that I have a more encompassing understanding of them.","Great Professor, gives candy for correct answer and makes sure he gets in a few jokes here and there each class",Great professor to have when dealing with the transition between high school and college.,I enjoy going to his lectures.,Great professor would recomend,He is a great professor! Throws candy for right answers and just overall great,"Javid really lets you know that he's a normal human being by making his class as enjoyable as possible. His practice tests are pretty true to the exams and as long as you take the homework seriously and try to pay attention in lecture, you won't have a problem. Easily my favorite professor this semester.","He's really a great professor who is able to connect with students. He has made my first semester much less harder than it needed to be because his tests and quizzes were straight forward and not overly difficult like other professors teaching the same class. If you have taken AP calculus, this class shouldn't be very difficult at all.","Javid Validashti, what a man. What a man.","He is seriously the nicest, funniest guy! Treats students like his friends, but is also very willing to help! I find his tests very straight forward and easy if you understand the material.

Yes, her material is hard to understand &amp; she assigns a lot of readings, but she will answer all your questions &amp; give you solid guidance on anything. This participation shows her your trying &amp; I think in turn that helps your grade. Put in a decent amount of work &amp; you can easily get an A.",Do not take this class with Dora. The class only consists of her going through slides and you taking notes. The slides go by too quickly and don't make sense. She also  makes you write a 10 page final paper in addition to a final exam which is excessive for a pop culture class. She's a nice lady but just way too much work.,"She makes so sense most of the time. Lecture consists of her rambling on and on about nonsense.  She goes off on tangents about things when she tries to relate to pop culture Lecture slides are where she gets her test questions from, but she goes through slides too fast/they don't make sense. If you don't read, you won't understand what's going on.","Really a great teacher. She expects a lot from you, so don't slack off. Will try and help you in your career if you seem interested. Don't take if you are not an absolute lover of film.",Both this course and Prof. Valkanova are great. You learn about film festival culture and then we organized a bad ass film festival.

1054530,3.5,Helga,Varden,15,0.5057673770266176,"Professor Varden is a very interesting lecturer. She is originally from Norway so she has a lot of cool perspectives. This class was an Ethics class which she is very knowledgeable in. The test was mainly papers and attendance, but she was a fair grader.",Professor Varden was my favorite of all my professors for this past semester. She's super interesting as a person and with her discussions. Her grading is very fair. You need to go to class or you will miss the discussion for that day. If you go to class and try on your essays the class will not be difficult to do good in.,"Professor Varden will make you think. But, she fell short with her organization of Phil 380. Most days it felt like she had no real lesson plan and would just resort to having us ""discuss"" the reading. The group discussions and subsequent class discussions lacked structure. Her teaching style is similar to Jeff Winger's in S5E2 of ""Community.""",She explained abstract ideas really well but the entire class was just sitting and listening to a lecture and writing a paper the next week. Also the TAs grade the papers and they grade tough. I would put hours and hours of work into a paper and I would get the same low grade every time. Don't take this class if you're looking for an easy genED.,"Her lecture's are really interesting, but the grading... don't even get me started. The grading done by both the TA's and teacher's is really tough. I would say you skip this one cause I regret my choice in taking it.","Professor Varden is one of the most amazing teachers I've ever had. She is intensely passionate, but incredibly patient in explaining the material. If you're confused, she'll make the time to work out the tricky parts with you. I recommend her to anyone who isn't lazy. You'll also be a better writer if you take her comments seriously.","Fantastic Professor!  She gives great real-life examples to help explain complex philosophical theories.  Class is definitely worth going to.  If you get lost, office hours are very helpful.","Prof Varden is a badass. I was disappointed to read some of the below posted comments, but they clearly represent a failing of the student less the instructor - this professor taught me more than I ever could've imagined. Kind, cheerful, forgiving (it's a tough subject), and patient. If you want to learn it, take it with Varden.",she is all over the place...cant' teach...stay away!!,"I really enjoyed Professor Varden and this class. She is smart, funny, and forgiving since the material can be a little tough. She can be a little bit all over the place sometimes and it is hard to follow her, but if you pay attention you will learn a lot, if you aren't already familiar with Rawls and Pogge, that is. Definitely recommended!",,This class is terrible!.....if you want to learn about old philosophers and their ideas then go ahead and take this class......other than that you write a lot of papers (all in which are graded extremely hard) and you have a final (also hard) worth 20% of your grade......I pretty much gave up when taking the final.....Not worth your time!,"She's so funny! She's really cool and makes class fun! She'll never shoot down your answer if you answer a question in class, so you never feel stupid. She's a good teacher too. She is willing to help but does that teacher thing where they make you figure it out on your own. She's awesome and hilarious though!!",No Comments,"If you are actually interested in learning Philosophy, then get out of this class as soon as possible.  Professor Varden was very unclear with what point she was trying to make, and most of the time the point was completely stupid!  Get out of this class immeidiately! and switch to another professor!"
940864,4.0,Caspi,Vardit,1,0.4775627345706511,"She speaks only in Hebrew the entire time of class.  You do get homework 2-3 times a week or so.  Sometimes its a long packet. Quizes once a month a test every 2 months. She is however a very nice teacher, she cares to help out.  If you do your work you will be fine in the class."
155216,3.5,Patrick,Vargas,34,0.4758745327737697,"This guy is fricking hilarious. He knows his stuff and you NEED to be in class because he never posts any of his slides online. But, you are allowed to take pictures of his slides lol. He's a very open person and a good teacher. Also very informative during office hours. But I didn't have the greatest TA, so I was very reliant on him heh.","He's great, but the class is hard. Be prepared to take notes everyday in class and read the book if you want an A on the tests.","Good luck. He's a cool guy, but that being said his exams are hard (no study guide). There are 4 assignments throughout the semester, the first 3 aren't too bad, the last one is a bit harder (ask for help). Read the book, he'll put some info into the exam. There's some extra credit &amp; he doesn't curve. Go to class or you won't get the notes.","He is a reallyyyy cool guy and tries to make lecture semi interesting. That being said the tests are ridiculously hard and he refuses to curve them. He asks a lot of questions like: Is it just A, A&amp;B, all of the above etc. which makes it very hard to get a question that you would normally know the answer to right.","Patrick has been one of my favorite professors over the two years that I've been on this campus. He knows how to effectively incorporate humor and his strange anecdotes to keep your attention in lecture. Attendance wasn't mandatory, but I never wanted to miss class because I genuinely enjoyed it. His tests are pretty tricky, but they didn't kill me","(ADV 281) Three tests, and four assignments, nothing more. Assignments are SUPER easy, but the tests.. give yourself some time to study. They're definitely not hard, just a lot of content but give yourself a couple days to study and you'll be fine. I got a 91 on the first test, but the second was a little harder so I did a little worse.","Vargas is an awesome guy. He's had a lot of experience in the field and plans his lectures pretty well. He is definitely quirky/vulgar, but if you take good notes and keep up with reading the chapters you'll find the class to be both easy and interesting. Best tip: If a subject shows up in both the text and lecture then it WILL BE on the exam",Vargas is definitely a character. His class is interesting but you really have to read the book to fully understand the material. He spends a lot of time talking about random off-topic things in class. He gives a lot of good examples if you can pay attention. He won't teach 481 anymore after this semester so not sure if he'll still teach?,"Professor Vargas is a great teacher. Although class was not mandatory, I went to everyone, including the Friday class because he actually makes learning interesting. He is also hilarious. Although the class was tough, I got a B. Would definitely recommend taking any class with him.","Vargas is a hilarious guy, and weirdly attractive, but as a professor (my semester) he was sub-par. I've heard this class was easier in the past, but fall 2012 was hell, he did a HORRIBLE job explaining material, provided almost no guidance on what we need to know for tests and from the book, and gave awful/ ambiguous instructions for assignments","Material isn't hard, but too much for one class. Should be two separate classes. Lack of any outline/study guide for the text only compounds this problem. Course is disorganized and Vargas often skips class or shows up and decides not to teach. When he does teach, he derails often with bad jokes/anectdotes capitalizing on shock value and vulgarity.",Not a bad class to learn some thing from. The materials are from popular press and easy to understand. A little lack of structure in teaching and digress considerably.Helpful when personally contacted.,"I had Vargas for both 481 and 490 in the same semester.  He's a super interesting guy but only really teaches well in small discussion settings instead of in big lectures.  481 was really hard to sit through for the whole semester but 490 was one of my favorite classes.  He makes pretty difficult tests, but it's not hard to at least get a B.","I took two classes with Vargas simultaneously (481 &amp; 490) and find him really entertaining and helpful.  His classes are difficult and require a lot of reading/note taking outside of class, but his classes are entertaining.  Yes, he goes off topic a lot, but that's what makes his classes fun.  He's really helpful if you talk to him in person.","Vargas is a controversial teacher. Students either like him or loathe him. Class is interesting, but yes, the stuff that appears on the test may be quickly went over. There are chances to get points in 481 and emerge with an easy B. Don't freak out when people gripe about the class - you can handle it.","Extremely difficult class. While he seems interested in what he's teaching you, it's often irrelevant to all tests and textbook material. The exams are extremely specific and very tricky rather than fair.","Class is entertaining but you don't actually learn the material. Tests are ridiculous; you're responsible for lecture and textbook (even what he doesn't cover). He refuses to put any slides on compass, and provides no study guide/outline for the tests.","Vargas is a great teacher of social pyschology, an essential ingrediant of advertising. He relies on the students to contribute to class, but when they falter he has a ton of interesting and knowledgable subejcts to discuss. Take his class if you are majoring in ADV.",i feel like im a math major now .. argggg,"I took the Psychology of Advertising class. It was Vargas's first time teaching the course, so it was fairly disorganized; however, he is just an amazing professor so it didn't matter! So hilarious and fun to talk to. Not bad to look at, either."

He is now teaching numerical classes for the CS department and I'd say don't miss a chance to have any class with him.,"He's a great professor for a great class, lecture isn't required, but it helps a lot foe sure. Super nice guy, his office hours were always great. This is one of my favorite classes ever.",Very clear and explains the harder concepts very simply,"Is intelligent in his field and knows what he is talking about, but lacks the in depth material needed to complete the homework and labs. Expect to do a lot of outside learning.",very nice and explains clear. feel free to throw questions.,The best teacher I've had in freshman year.,"Varodayan knows the material very well, and clearly cared for all students in the class. All of his lectures were interesting, enjoyable, and were connected to real life applications. He is very fair in grading, very responsive, and will do whatever it takes for students to fully understand the material. Would definitely recommend taking his class.","Very interesting class. Varodayan is a great professor, challenging and helpful. Easy to understand lecture, and midterms are generally not too difficult. He grades very generously and meticulously. Very fair grading system. Lectures are helpful and not boring.","Very enthusiastic about teaching the material, and easy to understand. He rushes through some of the material though",Good
404766,2.5,Dror,Varolin,12,0.46656423850961354,This guy was a knob...Most obnoxious prof. I've ever had.  I think he has an inflated opinion of himself because he has a Ph.D. and we're just students.  Stay away from him like the plague!,"I thought Dror was awesome. He always encouraged students and offered help. I'd say he's the best professor I've had yet and he actually kept me interested in the material, which is hard to do. Those of you who didn't like the class would have been fine if you didn't slack off so much.","Lets just say he challenged the class to the extreme. My raw average at the end of the semester was about 48.5 percent, and I still got a C for my letter grade. His tests are extremely hard, but I definitely learned a lot in the class. So if you like a challenge and want to learn a lot, take his class, but be prepared for low percentages.",Let's just say that the average for the final was a 48%.,Dror spent more time trying to be young and cool than anything else. He is the worst math prof. i've ever had. i think he has a complex with being young and having a ph.d. or something like that. he's very intimidating. his lecture examples are useless and you're on your own for learning everything.,"Dror is the worst.  I have learned the most I ever have in this class and am doing the worst I have ever done in any class. This is because his exams are irrevelant to the problems in the book and lecture. O yea, and on his website he has pictures of himself **** and stoned!","He's a sadistic school teacher who pretends to ""teach"" math. I'm really not too sure what he's doing teaching considering he has no ability to teach or interact with people in a civil manner. If I ever got into a class with him as the professor again, I'd freak out and instantaneously drop the class","Great guy, laid back, seems a little confused at times, the people who always complain should just actually look at the book and do some homework for once.  Afterall, the class is curved so stop complaining.  And he does do examples and all of his ""rude"" comments are sarcastic!!! He's joking!!",No Comments,"Dror has begun doing examples in class, as well as in discussion. He is a great guy, and I think a very good teacher","He is obnoxious, rude, and just plain nasty. He refuses to hand out practice tests like many other math 242 professors do. His lectures are worthless and he never does any examples. He snaps at students who ask questions and calls them ""stupid questi","Great guy!  Very interested in the material, good explanations, very laid back."

1214621,4.0,John,Vasquez,21,0.5611491929751627,Vasquez is well-regarded in the department which to me reflects pretty poorly on the department. Teaching methods rely more on making a big show of how well-read and self-righteous he is than actually introducing relevant topics. Felt like the class was stuck in the mid-1900's and forgot that the study of power has progressed since.,"Two classes per week you will have a power point presentation lecture.  His lectures are decent but not captivating.  Sometimes he is pretty funny.  The TA's grade harsh (as usual) they grade far harsher than any professor does.  I don't understand TA's as graders.  A semester or two ago they were our peers, now they decide our grades.","Vasquez is pretty funny and made class really interesting, plus there was a lot of extra credit opportunities. This class isn't an easy A but if you show up to class and study then you should be fine. There are only four grades for the class so exams are a big part of your grade","course material was pretty interesting, dont miss class if u think u can just take notes from the ppt because the powerpoints he uploads are trash. TA's graded way too hard. learned the most from discussion dont miss those. readings are uploaded/online","Obviously a brilliant academic, but he appears very disinterested in teaching. Make sure to get to know your TA and engage with the book material. You can get a lot out of the course even without too much of his input.","Took PS300 with him over the summer in Austria (also traveled to Italy and Germany). He is a great teacher that knows A LOT about  WWI and International Relations Theory. However, we did read a lot and it seemed as though there was a lot of work. I definitely enjoyed the class though and would recommend the experience to anyone.","I took this course over the summer in Vienna, Austria. It's one of the best courses I've ever taken in undergrad. It's amazing how much you are able to learn, see, and experience in the month you are abroad. While the course is a fair amount of work, it was highly interesting and you really do learn a lot. Many opportunities to travel! Recommend!","I took this course in Vienna and it was his first time teaching it alone. I became an WWI expert in about 10 days of class. I had a midterm, final, and 12 page paper. In my opinion, it was way too much to do in less than a month. However, it was an amazing opportunity to present our papers at the Schloss Leopardskron aka 'Sound of Music House.'","Professor Vasquez commands the classroom like no other professor I have had before at U of I. His ability to help explain the main arguments of assigned readings during class helps conceptualize difficult readings. Vasquez expects students to read all material, as is the norm in college, by doing so you are rewarded with a good grade",He is a really good and easy-going professor. And he is knowledgeable in his field of research and this course is really eyeopening! I really enjoyed it!,"He was THE best professor out of many I have taken courses with. His expectations on students are pretty high. He requires them to complete all the readings assigned before class, and asks questions and encourage lively discussions about the contents, which was really helpful and motivational. I strongly urge you to take this course, won't regret i","After receiving 2 As and 2 A+s from the PS Department, I took this course but now have to drop it. Here's why: there's no slides offered to students , you have to jot down all notes purely by hearing. He always asks very detailed but not so important questions during the class. Though he was helpful after class, he didn't reply 2 out of 3 my emails",He's a good lecturer. I love PS280 and it is such an interesting class. He makes his lectures pretty interesting and he is very clear. The textbook is good too. Very straightforward.,"He's a really interesting guy, but sit in front of class because he's the type of talker who starts off his sentences loudly but ends in a whisper. The lectures can be a bit dry, but he's a funny person and is pretty clear on what he's looking for in exam responses. You'll survive if you do all the readings and go to lectures.","Your grade largely depends on the TA that you get. Mine was a very hard grader so I had to work really hard at this class. I didn't find it very rewarding when I was finished with it either. The material is easy, but the grading wasn't.","Awesome professor! Knows what he is talking about, interested in teaching, and wants you to learn too. Three exams (all short answers) and one paper. If you put in the time and effort, you'll do fine!",Both my favorite professor and person in the Political Science department.  He has put out an impressive body of well-regarded work and  really cares about his students.  That is a rare combination. It would be a sin to earn a degree in political science without taking a class with him.,"The best professor I've had.  He expects a lot, but if you put the time and effort in, you'll likely take as much out of this class as any other.  Prof. Vasquez holds an incredible wealth of knowledge and is friendly and great to work with.  Can't recommend him highly enough.","Definitely my favorite class this semester. Interesting guy that you can learn a lot from. You have to write one paper (5-6 pages) and have a midterm and final. Tests are all short answer, but if you know the material you will be fine.","What a great professor!  Challenger yourself a bit. Do a little reading, and you will walk out of this class learning a lot.  Mixture of a bit history, and analytically thinking about policy utilized by key leaders.   This is a study abroad class also for 2009 summer."

SHe is very passionate, puts in a lot of effort answering questions and has deep knowledge of the material. She inspired 4 of us in the class to take up research for credit with her. Totally worth it.",Great content. Every lecture had content that no other class covers. She is very passionate about the subject and is able to give a lot of context from industry experience. Exams are difficult and long. Homeworks are manageable. Definitely worth taking.,"I don't want to come off as rude, but I honestly don't know why she is allowed to teach. Her accent is unbearable, she either won't answer questions or make fun of the people who asked them before answering, has nonstop technical problems, and even supplied the wrong information a few times in class. Avoid at all costs.",Worst class i've ever taken.,Excellent content. Highly recommend for anyone who wants to do CAD or algorithms in future. I got a lot out of this class.,"It will be very hard to get a clear concept of this class. She brings her ppt for every class, but actually most of them are directly from textbook. She makes a lot of mistakes during classes and some of them are critical. She'll often take several days to answer the question. However the content of the class is quite interesting.",she is extremely terrible. Dont ever want her class for My whole life,"Not a good lecturer. There are still things to get out of a lecture from her, but she makes mistakes frequently. She also does not communicate well with the other professor and we were frequently behind and would have to teach ourselves entire weeks of materials to try and do the hw. Tests are long and relatively hard.","Probably the worst professor that I met so far. The lectures are completely useless and she makes mistakes in class, which comes to haunt you for tests and ESPECIALLY homework. Hands down the worst prof.",She is very passionate about the subject. Sometimes gives hard homeworks. But generally a good class- material is not covered by any other class. Bright in answering questions.,She is very passionate about the material. Sometimes drives students too hard about attendance. Very bright in answering questions.,Completely screwed up class..I guess she hardly knows the material and also she hardly looks into the material before coming to class..Homeworks are long and hard..,"Whatever the previous two comments said about this course is extremely misleading, exactly opposite way. She cancelled classes at the last moment,  never prepare for class, basically can't explain things clearly. She gave a pretty syllabus on the course website at the beginning of the semester, however, it was never followed or updated.",This was the graduate class. Prof. Vasudevan covered a lot of material in a relatively short period of time without decreasing the quality of the class.,She was very helpful and enthusiastic about the hardware verification class (a graduate course at ECE). The class was mostly discussion driven and she covered a lot of topics in a short period of time.,Great!,Lectures barely helped in homework/exams and she is not very helpful. She comes off very arrogant and rude. Not very approachable,"Lecs were good but the course is too hard. Exam 1 was out of reach, but Exam 2 and 3 were ok. She puts in a lot of effort in answering student questions after class. Listens to students and responds to email queries and Compass questions. She did her best but the course was horrible.","No mincing words, Lecs are useless. You'll be teaching yourself the material. The class in itself is interesting though, though the exams are often so notoriously hard and time-constrained that you can hear people muttering for days afterwards..

Don't take this class if you wanna fail!,"Pay attention in lectures, and you barely have to do any of the reading. Class is 4 3 page papers, 2 6 page papers, an open-book midterm exam, and an 11ish page easy final project.

If you want to get anything out of the money you pay to take econ, do not do it with Vazquez.","Probably one of the easiest classes I've ever taken. For instance, I completely forgot to do one of the High Stakes Quizzes and did so-so on the others but still got an A. Despite being easy, I didn't think I actually learned the material as well as I should have. Vazquez makes the lectures enjoyable and topical, not mandatory but would recommend.","You can either choose to attend classes and get a straightforward A or skip all classes and take the final also for an A. Class is fun, though not very closely related to what appears on quizzes. Need to learn by yourself sometimes","Literally the easiest class youll take at UIUC. Its pretty much a guaranteed A. Quizzes are a pretty big portion of your grade, but he lets you take them an unlimited amount of times. If youre actually interested in economics I wouldnt recommend this class, but if you need an easy Gen Ed then this is the class for you.",Lots of thought provoking and interesting lectures. We didn't cover the material very frequently in class it was more discussion based and quizzes and high stakes quizzes would be completed on our own. Overall great teacher and great class.,"The class is super easy, getting an A+ is no problem. However, if you didn't take Micro in high school or do independent studying outside of class, then you may fail to actually learn any concepts. He only reviews the most difficult examples in class, which may confuse those who don't have a strong understanding of the concepts.","It is an easy A class overall, and Dr Vazquez is really nice in grading. Honestly, I learnt all materials on my own during the spring break in order to finish take-home online quiz. It is amazing that I did not listen to him for one second ever but I got an A+ eventually haha","Prof. Vasquez is a rational and entertaining instructor. He is funny and passionate enough to make a topic I don't find interesting not too bad to learn about. The class is practically participation based, and with minimal effort it is easy to obtain a solid grade.","I took Econ in high school and this course completely confused me on everything I had learned before. The pre-lecture and lectures were not helpful at all, and the quizzes had challenging questions that weren't even covered in the course. Thank god it was an easy A where you had infinite tries on tests. Just show up, do your work and you can get A+","While Professor Vazquez's ECON 102 class is the easiest class you will ever sign up for, do not expect to learn too much. His class is 100% based on attendance and completion. Nothing is graded for accuracy and therefore you should earn an automatic A+. He also gives extra credit every class so you should get over a 100% in the class.","Best Professor in UIUC, just show up in class and there is NO midterm, NO final, only online test, which you can attempt unlimited times ! Easy A+","Not a great teacher, spends most of the lecture ""debating"" with himself to try and make a point but mostly just makes it difficult to know what we should be writing down. Exams were super challenging, except for the final which was 80% questions straight from midterms. He also requires you to use his website, which you have to pay for.","Lecture is useless. Rather than building up your knowledge, Vasquez likes to choose the most convoluted, specific examples, adding unwritten context, and spending the entire lecture explaining why the majority of the class is wrong. He has not deepened my understanding of econ. Take for an easy A, but not if you need harder econ classes","Took it FA 17' and the class was cake. You can take the exams as many time as you want, they are online due at the end of the course. everything else is graded for effort. You can do the classwork at home, since it is on packback. Easy A","He is not a good teacher, I actually know less about Econ now purely because I was confused. But I took this as an elective so I'm not too bothered. I do not deserve an A+ but I got it because you can retake exams an infinite amount of times. Bad professor, but you should take the class for a free A.","Vazques makes you pay for Flip It and Packback for the class. You do Pre-lectures, Bridges, Quizzes, and HSQs. I suggest going to class and doing the Classwork. Classwork is 20% of your grade and for a lot of people make a difference. Go to class, do homework, and participate in EC and you are guaranteed an A.",Good class to take for honors credit - knows what he is doing.,"Professor Vazquez is currently conducting research in teaching techniques and how to engage students. The class has many components (Piazza, Packback, FlipIt, and Moodle). However the course structure changes by year. Attendance is not mandatory, but if you show up everyday you wont need to take the final. Vazquez is interesting and makes you think","His lectures are very interesting and the work is very easy. There's no midterm and the final is optional, and you can reattempt all quizzes and tests, so as long as you do the work, it's an easy A. The only downside is that FlipIt is like $80 and it's worth a good portion of your grade."

Tests and quizzes are straightforward and not too difficult, but he was a tough grader on the papers. Be prepared for a lot of writing.","Smart guy...not sure he wants to be teaching, though.

His tests are very straight forward and he occasionally creates study sheets for the discussions. Great Teacher,"He's a really easy grader on papers and tests. His tests are really easy if you pay attention in class and study a little.

Generally a good good guy and teacher","He knows what he's talking about but he's not very good at directing discussions or making you feel like your point was worthwhile.

His method of teaching is conducive to learning- watch a movie, discuss readings about the movie and other topics, watch clips that tie both readings and movie together. These clips provide inspiration for papers. I've said too much. Billy is awesome, if you have a chance, take his class.","This guy really likes what he's doing, and that makes class so much more fun.

Some days he's got a sense of humor and connects well. Other days... not so much. In the middle of the semester, he demanded all students sit in the front half of class. He'd halt lecture and point them out. Once halted to make them all move to the front.","I wish I could go back in time and not choose Vieira.

Usually ~20 people (including me) go to his lectures. Enough said.","Symbolic logic is endlessly dull for me personally, but if you're interested in the subject I don't think you could do better than Wagner.

He doesn't like answering questions","Had him 213/4. In 213, he was actually fine for the most part, though his lectures arent always great at preparing you for the HW in my opinion. My biggest problem with him however is how he will outright refuse to answer certain questions because they are from older exams in the course, even though the question itsef is actually relevant.","Better than the other physics classes at UIUC. Really hard but Wagner made this class bearable, especially with all the jokes!","Wagner was a solid professor for quantum.

I took her Spring 2014, and she did a pretty good job.  Yes, there were times where mistakes were made, but on the whole, her class was pretty easy and straight forward.","She must have gotten better since other raters had her.

She gets confused a lot and sometimes teaches false info, only to be caught by students, so you're probably better off not going. Buy the book and read through her online ""lecture objectives"" to study for exams. She has a tendency to ask very specific, obscure questions on exams, so read everything.","Wow where do I start?

Not well prepared, frequent breaks to ""gather her thoughts"" By far the worst professor I have ever had!!","Buy the book, don't go to the class.  For the exams study the most random, unimportant, and irrelevant topics, this will be much more useful than the topics she spends hours struggling through","Fantastically awful.

He uses guest lecturers most of the time so it keeps class interesting. Fair with his grading. Make sure you do the sketching and journal assignments. He does keep somewhat of an attendance bc he uses iclickers during class. As long as you pay attention and get the study guides done, you will be fine. Good teacher overall","He is a good teacher. He makes use of other guest lecturers to do most of his class. Class is quite easy because he gives a study guide before the exams. Still helpful to take notes though.

She gives lots of examples, which are extremely helpful.","great teacher! Explains it in ways that no other instructor at UIUC does for 329 - make sure you take 2 different sections to get the whole idea! once you get it on the Homeworks, it is easy.

The final was a bit of a curveball though cause she put in some higher level stuff.,"First midterm is hard, but there is a curve, and next two midterms and final are much easier.  Do the homework, and review past exams before the final exam.  She would make 1/3 of students to get an A.","She is willing to help you, but her English is a little tough for students to understand. The first midterm is crazy, since that was her first semester at UIUC, but Mid 2, Mid 3, and final are usual. If you go to class and do the homework, you will at least get a B. If you do the practice problems she posted, you will get an A."

Professor Wang has a broad knowledge, and I really like to talk with her about my career plan.","You know it's her teaching for the first time, but she is really helpful and nice if you go to her office hours. I like to talk with her about the SOA exams. It would be better if she can improve her teaching skills.","dont know why but her final become the same as practice but beware, you will never know what she will give, first exam was hard, second was even harder (she decide to drop the second midterm), heavy accent , i never go to class since first midterm",Wang is one of the worst professors here at the University. I would avoid having her by all means. The problem is she can't teach and you have to use the ASM manual to teach yourself the material. The practice tests are way easier than her actual tests so don't make the mistake of not preparing just because you found the practice test easy!

Midterm was impossible (average a low D), but final was a little easier.","Does not really teach much at all or seem to have actual knowledge of material being taught. Exams and cases are next to impossible and are graded vaguely without any type of reasoning behind them.

The class material is not hard overall but she somehow makes it confusing. If you ask her more or something other than class, not helpful. Class is super boring and distracting.

There are weekly two page opinion journals over readings, two 5 page analysis papers, and a 7-9 page final report. That's it. No tests or final, and is a great class especially if you enjoy voicing your opnion. Will definitely change the way you view our current culture.","This class is the best class I have taken at the University of Illinois.  You learn so much about the issues of the world and how you truly feel about those issues.  Ross Wantland is truly an amazing person, and his classes should be mandatory.  You should take this class!","Amazing class! one of the easiest and most worthwhile classes on campus. you talk a lot about relevant issues and it prepares you to become a FYCARE instructor if you choose to do that after. TA's are NOT liberals, they just want to know what you think. Zero tests, some writing but it's mostly opinionated.","I had Ross for CHLH 199B and 340B as well. Do not be fooled by some of the comments before me. The class talks about a lot of different important issues and the TAs are not all hardcord liberals. Mostly, just write about what you think of the materials in class and you should get an A. This class opened my eyes a lot and the best class I ever took","I believe this is the best class offered at the University of Illinois.  Many difficult and emotional issues are raised, but Ross is always there for his students with support and advice.  His students learn things about themselves and the community that cannot be learned in any other class.  Ross inspires his students to work for social change.","I learned a lot, however the class could have been summed up in 2 lectures.  We wrote too many damn journals and papers. I wrote more for that class then I did for any english class I have ever taken. It was irritating to read and talk about the same thing constantly. TA grading is very subjective.If you want an A and a lot of stress take the class","this class is a joke.  its really easy and all you gotta do is voice your opinion.  however, dont say an opinion that isnt like his, becaue if the TA gardes it, he/she will give you a bad grade cuz theyre all hardcore liberals in that class","Ross is a wonderful teacher and a wonderful man.  I can honestly say that the CARE class (or FPREP, I've taken both) was the best class I've ever taken, and certainly the most applicable to my life.  Not only do I recommend for anyone to take a class of Ross', I think you'd be stupid if you didn't!"

Love ward.,Very passionate about his class and makes lectures something to look forward to.,"Mike is a friendly guy but the class is tedious. I barely got the A but it wasn't hard; you just can't wing anything, but a couple hours is sufficient for his exams. He is a rambler of a lecture and a lot of the class is you figuring out how to tell if something is important or not. He also is good about offering research opportunities.","Friendly guy. Took me a while to get used to his unconventional teaching style (lots of stories, not much focus on theory). The two exams account for like 70% of your grade, and involve both conceptual free response and multiple choice. But there's some extra credit. It isn't always clear what to take out of lecture, but I learned a lot overall.","You do have to go to class for guest lecturers because thats usually when he passes around the attendance sheet. I admit his way of lecturing was different, but hes super nice","His class is super easy. After some basic ecology and conservation biology, you can almost not attend class. I really like his stories and management background. He relates his lectures to what is actually happening as opposed to just theory.",Just not a good Professor.  Scattered and unclear.,He's a nice enough guy but grades entirely too subjectively.  His lectures are rushed and scattered leaving you unaware of what you should be taking away from all his babble.  Dropped another class with him after taking this first one.,After attending his seminar I was thrilled to learn he would be teaching my ecology class. He's a wonderful speaker and got me thinking about things I hadn't considered when contemplating management issues. He knows his stuff and I can't wait for ornithology with him!

Devoid of any emotion and extremely spacey-despite me specifically talking to her many times, she never remembered who I was.","She was very apathetic when it came to teaching my class. She would set up a still life and leave or just stand and stare at the wall as we were drawing- she wouldn't walk around to give criticism, help, etc. from her on your drawing unless you approached her for it.

On the other hand, I learnt by far the most from his class than all of my other classes combine together. No over exaggeration.

You have to put in time and most aren't willing to keep up with it which is why people don't do well. Pay attention, keep up (esp at the end), go into office hours, ACTUALLY TRY, and you can do well.

I thought he was always very well prepared for class and had a very knowledgable background in the subject.

As long as you do most of the assignments hell give you an A. I missed one of my 'big' assignments but i think he thought he lost it, i still got an A. I literally only went to class whenever i felt like getting up. A lot of times I'd sleep in to find out he canceled class anyways. Take his class.","Easy A. This guy is such a blow off. He canceled class all the time. Only bad thing is that he often didn't show up to class since he would miss his bus. Therefore, we would waste our time by showing up.

I dont think his homework is helpful at all.,"Weaver gets a bad rep, but the fact of the matter is, electronic properties of materials is a difficult subject.

Use the office hours because the TA's were very helpful and DON'T FALL BEHIND or you are screwed.","This is a really difficult class and moves very quickly. Although he is a nice guy, Weaver sometimes laughs when we complain how hard the class is. He also lies about not having quizzes. Have fun :)",This class is meant to use your math skills so expect to use calculus a lot. The class moves quickly and he goes through a lot of information. The tests are loooooong.

He is very enthusiastic about chemistry which makes lecture much easier to attend.,"He's a great prof, and you can tell that he really cares about his students and takes his job seriously.  He uses demos which not only help to make sense of the actual chemistry, but also make class far more enjoyable to attend.

He motivates the new concepts very well and Prof Weaver has a good sense of humor and good personality. I found his notes extremely useful.","Clearly excited about the material, and funny to boot",Professor Weaver is so fat the best physics professor I have ever known. He is humorous and dedicated to teaching. His exams are fair(average around 80). A good professor to take classes for.,One of the rare physics teachers who teaches you to THINK like a physicist.,"He is a kind and interesting guy. Although the course is relatively hard, his lecture is good. Homework is difficult sometimes, but is always interesting.","This man is amazing! Teaches you the most epic things from the ground up. Great notes, works hard to prepare for class. Goes well beyond what is expected, and is always willing to help.

There are also a lot of readings. This class is cross listed with philosophy 419, but it leans too heavily  on the philosophy side. The professor does not speak clearly either. He does have good office hours though if you have questions so use that as a resource"
1792423,3.2,Gregory,Webb,2,0.503469046947924,"The course was a standard introduction to literary theory. He sometimes hEld fast to his own interpretation of a work so intensely that no others could be considered as valid. Occasionally deducted points for arbitrary reason, did not give adequate notice of a class cancellation, promoted tone and speech policing in the classroom. But seemed okay.","He's pretty tough on making you do all the work, but he's willing to help if you put in the effort. He had lots of quizzes but they were easy if you did the reading. Could be a little easier on not accepting any work late. He's funny so that makes class better, but he also won't give any participation credit unless you talk during class."

The only plus-side was that he gave us about 3/4 of the test questions as review questions, and I ended up almost acing the final because of it."

If do the work expect an A- at the LEAST,No comment,Rebecca was helpful in guiding students in writing their own short stories and gave excellent feedback. her facilitation skills may be a bit unpolished resulting in awkward moments but i did not find it so negative as it opened up some people to speak. great class!,"Seems like she has toughened up a little bit. she's really friendly and helpful. kinda awkward and be ready to talk about current events. a few short papers and an 8-10 page researched persuasive paper. I would recommend her, but dont show up expecting an A.","Rebecca was very knowledgable about writing and rhetoric. She also treated us students as equals as well i.e. would not talk down to us. She is very sweet, very leniant, and is an easy grader. She makes stereotypically boring rhetoric quite bearable.",Really nice. easy grader. lets students write syllabus including how late you can show up to class and how many absenses you are allowed (6 in my class).,"Looking at passed reviews it seems like she has toughened up a little bit. She is still very nice (and a little awkward). However, I wouldn't say that if you just show up to class you are fine. You have to write an 8-10 page persuasive paper. Along with  smaller papers and assignments that go with the research paper. Still, i would recommend her!","She is great! Lets class pick assignments and write syllabus. Not a lot of work. Writing assignments were very fair, as was grading!

He makes the class very simple, no exams (except a pop quiz here and there) and there are 3 main essays to complete. Lectures can be a bit dry but overly this a great course and teacher!",I've taken a couple courses with Professor Wedig now and I'm currently registering to take another. I'm a Global Studies major and Wedig is my favorite professor in the major. He can be funny and is very approachable.

There wasn't too much work and it wasn't very hard at all. I would recommend it.,"The class is incredibly boring but he is a great professor.

I feel like every lecture is her venting about her life to all of the students. She hates my class because we don't really do a great job of staying attentive, but it's pretty fun. As for the curriculum, I feel that i made a huge mistake taking this class, it is way too simple.","This class was a lot of fun and really taught you how to look at argumentation.

This class has interested me in going into law, an unforeseen venture.  She selects great TA's too.",My main criticism is that the class moves a little slow sometimes; we had to cut out everything on Kant.

You will learn a lot about Judaism!","Although there are quizzes each week (12 total) most of your grade is determined by the midterm, final paper, and final.  Your grade is determined by your TA because some are easier graders than others (drastically).  The lectures themselves are okay (different person per religion) but you could pass by just reading the textbook and powerpoints.","This class was taught differently, where each new religion had a new lecturer, but when he was up at the podium, he didn't seem too great. He's super anal about texting in class or using your laptop to take notes, so expect to use a pen and paper. He was really passionate about the subject, just not the best at presenting the information.","Dov is a very knowledgable professor, and his tests are EASY. he brings in guest lecturers for each religion so you don't get too much of the Dov, but he is a good lecturer and a very fair test writer.","Professor Weiss is awesome! Not only is he infectiously enthusiastic about his field, but he also goes out of his way to meet with and help students.

But Prof Weiss is beyond knowledgeable on judaism and keeps class interesting. Take this class.","Dov is simply an awesome human being.  He loves teaching, and that's easy to see. Actually cares about his students-usually asks us before making decisions on papers or tests.  He has so much life experience in this stuff that he really keeps lectures interesting.  I had no interest in this class  initially, but because of him, I really enjoyed it!","Very interesting teacher. Enthusiastic and knowledgeable about topic, making class interesting. Cares about students and wants to make class fair. Four different books are required, but reading is not intense.","Dov is literally the best professor I've ever had.

Only ones who laughed at his jokes were HIM and maybe 1 or 2 other ignorant/lame people in the class.  Very hard and stupid class... bad teacher... get outta herr!,While he is humorous people tend to forget that his humor is based off ignorant remarks.

Prof. Weissman's lectures are pretty good, although I'll admit it was easy to zone out at times.  He's all about discussion, so if someone has a question, he'll spend as long as it takes to talk it out.  Pretty good, overall.","A really great physics professor.

Knowledgable and passionate, she is easily one of the best professors out there.","This was the coolest class ever! You make your own movies, which is so much easier than it looks.

He'd often go off on unrelated tangents and fail to really convey the relevant concepts covered in assignments. Also, discussions in lecture were not typically fruitful because it seems that he didn't really comprehend students' questions/points.","Wengert can be compelling but tends to get off track with his lectures, focusing more on the history of philosophy (as well as some trivia) than the philosophy itself. This makes reading for class a little pointless. Other philosophy professors I had were more focused on the texts, providing quotations of them, and clarifying their meaning.","I waited for this class to be taught again by Professor Wengert. I absolutely love him. He is a brilliant, saucy, silver-tongued devil. He is so passionate about ancient philosophy. Lectures are long but are always lively. I wish I could take more of his classes.","He is a very nice friendly professor and person. The class has too much reading for an undergraduate level philosophy class. The papers have topics never discussed in class. Grades depends on him and TA. At final, he gives every one a fairly curve can improve grades up to higher letter grades.","If you want an A, stay way from him. His class are too abstract and challenge for a 200 level philosophy class. He is interesting and friendly. The exams and homeworks are very difficult. Lots materials to study for his class. Not recommend any philosophy class with him after all.","Please do not trust any thing you see here about this professor, the class is very hard, exams and papers are graded harshly and do not by who such as eitherh himself or a TA, the assignments are out of class content domain, not recommand this class, take this class with another professor.","Very knowledgeable and excitable.  His manner of speaking keeps you awake, and he really enjoys engaging the students.  Quizzes are online and the questions are given beforehand.  All homework/tests were pretty easy if you go to class.","Very excited od man who has great knowledge in Greek and Latin. There are 2 papers, 5 online quizzes, and a final which is multiple choice and essay response.","Professor Wengert is an incredible professor. He has a great sense of humor and happily answers any and all questions you might have. He knows his stuff, and you will learn new things every lecture. Definitely recommended.",awesome professor. can't believe he's still an assistant prof. after so many yrs at uiuc. he's probably one of those who don't give a crap about positions but just try to teach well and be an excellent human being. he reminds me so much about socrates..(at least the platonic socrates)..one who devalues the worldly things and values true wisdom,"Awesome professor. Fun, upbeat, very knowledgeable. He doesn't take attendance but if you don't come to class it will be hard to understand whats going on. A lot of reading but that is why 203 meets only 3 hours a week but is worth 4 credit hours.","Wengert is an awesome man, and a great professor. He has a great sense of humor, and is extremely knowledgeable in so many fields. He not only has a strong passion for philosophy and logic, but also a passion for teaching it. Extremely approachable and answers questions very well. He made me decide to pursue a minor in phil. Highly recommended","Professor Wengert is hilarious in the classroom. He is an extremely old man, and he wanders around much like a person would imagine Socrates would. He is especially astute when it comes to answering student questions.",Best teacher at the University.  Hands down a fantastic professor.  Take anything you can by him.,"I love Wengert!  If you enjoy easy mathematical thinking and appreciate a weird sense of humor, you'll love his class.  Many students in this class struggled, but he was always very helpful.  He was also very understanding when people had problems doing the homework online.  Overall, Wengert is an extremely intelligent and witty man.","Wengert is a GREAT teacher. very enthusiastic and funny. I was thinking about dropping this class or changing it but i stayed in bc i liked wengert so much! I'd have to admit though, mathematical philosophy can get really confusing at the end with symbols and stuff- but they shouldn't be hard if you understand the hw.",Wengert is great.  He really knows his stuff and makes class interesting.  He has a wealth of knowledge and eager to share it.,"I attended this class many years ago, but I must comment since he was my absolute favorite of all time. He had an incredibly interesting way of speaking and making one understand. Also, I remember him working with me personally on a project I was having difficulty with. I liked logic before, but I loved it afterwards and still do. Thank you BW!!!",Best professor ever.  Don't listen to the idiots who can't handle basic logic.  Funny and personable.  Great pleasure taking several of his classes.,Wengert is hilarious!!!

Funny, pretty clear, always tries to engage the class in the lecture. Final was hard, but as long as you complete the HW you shouldn't do worse than a C in the class.","After taking TAM251 with other Tam professors, I now appreciate West alot more. He was a very good lecturer. Provided helpful examples for the hw and didn't try to fail you like the rest of the TAM department. Being honest, the final is hard, but if you do good on the hw, discussion, and quizzes (are exactly like hw), then you'll be fine.","His lectures aren't useful for the homework or quizzes, but they're very informational and he's passionate about what he teaches.

Material is pretty easy, but he keeps lectures relatively interesting.","Very good at providing a concise overview of difficult topics.  For me, the homework was what provided the needed practice to master the topics.  Lectures were useful, but the repetitive practice is what really allowed me to learn the material.  Quiz retake policy was very generous.  However, the final was significantly more difficult.","West is not a great professor but this class is not very hard. Lectures are basically useless because he wastes time on conceptual iClicker questions rather than questions like those on homework and quizzes; however, the material is not too difficult and easy to learn. The final exam is a bit tricky, but can be solved easily when simplified.","Our semester was basically a guinea pig semester for 212 to try out new things, so although there were some bumps in the road,  he was very helpful and understanding along the way.",Really taught the basics well. Had some issues making exams that were of a proper difficulty. The midterms were too easy so the final was made to be impossible.

However, the final was so ridiculously hard that out of the 150 students in the room, only a handful left before the 3 hours were up. A few problems were featured that were not covered in class.","Great professor, take his classes if you can.","Good explanation, well-structured and patient. Nice guy!

She's notorious for not replying student's emails, but the TA's are extremely helpful and dedicated. I learned a lot from the course, maybe not too much from her specifically.","Professor White can be very intimidating.  She often jumps into the material without giving her students any background on what she is going to be teaching.  The lectures weren't very organized, and she assumes that her students know way more than they actually know.  I would not recommend her, but she is usually the only one teaching this course.",Christina White is the kind of professor to specifically say something won't be on the exam and then make it 25% of the exam.

She is a cute person.,"It's definitely a tough class and there is a lot of work that needs to be put into it. She's a very kind lady and is always more than happy to answer questions and make you understand the topic as simply as possible. That being said, go in for office/tutoring hours if you are confused with anything as it is much more helpful than just the lectures.","I thought that the class was extremely challenging and I did not find her very helpful at answering my questions, but this may be because I was so lost for most of the class.","Calc II is SUPER hard but she is a great professor. She will explain things as well as she can, but it really is up to you to do your homework and go to tutoring to figure the rest out.","This class felt like a very long marathon to live through. The homework was very stressful and difficult. To get a good grade, you have to put in every single bit of effort you know how to give. There were many TAs available for help.

Quite helpful if you attended office hours, and doing midterm/final exam reviews are a must. Class was difficult and she was challenging, however I would still recommend this professor.","Excellent professor, very clear examples, and generous curve.  She may be a little more difficult on the exams, but it is very reasonable for Calc for peoplewho have taken calculus.","Took her calc 1 class, she is a lecturer and lecturers like one. Her class is harder than the other professors calc classes. She is clear and makes sense, she will take the time to explain at office hours. I bought the book, very expensive, used it for homework once. Only reason to buy is bc it is required for calc 1 through 3.","Book is pricey and only used twice. Buy it on IBX and get WebAssign from the source. Whittlesey is clear, concise, passionate, and sarcastically funny. If you don't care, you won't do well. Don't sleep, chat, or disrespect her.  Do the midterm reviews.  They tell you almost exactly what will be on the exams. You'd be a fool not to. Best TAs ever.","I thought she was great!  she really explained well, and made calculus somewhat enjoyable!","She is a great professor! The class isn't easy and the homework and tests are hard, but if you put in the effort, you can do well. She is extremely helpful, especially in office hours, and funny. Definitely recommend her for Math 221!",She is the best professor giving me lecture at this semester.,"Had way to much homework per week; it was all so unnecessary. Never had any idea what was going to be on the exam, plus the TAs made you feel stupid for not understanding something. Waste of time considering I still havent learned anything.",Horrible class. Web homework will consume your time enormously. Her lecture is disorganized and unclear. Exams and quizzes are ridiculously difficult. I saw 90% of people couldn?t finish the exam when the time was over. I expect A for this class but I don?t want to meet this professor again.

He also does a review of the previous lecture at the start of every new lecture...very helpful. LOTS of info in his section, sometimes he talks too fast and things went over my head sometimes. I studied hard for his exam though and only missed 1 question","Wickesberg's section of psyc210 was one of the easiest of the four. He was enthusiastic and added humor to his lectures, maintaining students' interest in the subject. Some of his exam questions were worded strangely, but they all corresponded to his lecture slides, so study those and you'll be fine.","This teacher was absolutely terrible. Spoke too fast, even with a computer in class couldn't finish writing one fact before he was done with another. Test had absolutely nothing to do with the slides and contained the most obscure information.

Definitely take a class wit him!,There's 4 tests if you do bad on one the last test is the same test and you get to keep all the tests. The tests were easy based on the slides and extra stuff he puts exactly on the board. He says that with some info if I haven't used it my whole career why should you need to know it.  He explains the info in layman's terms. Best Prof. at UI,"He was an absolutely fantastic teacher. I wish all profs were like him. TAKE HIS CLASSES, YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT!!!

Fabulous professor!,"Great guy, awesome teacher",I had prof Wickesberg for psyc210 in the summer.  I thought he was such a great teacher that I took 316.  I DEFINETLY reccommend it.

She definitely understands. This is one class that I was so sad to finish. Would take another class with her in a heartbeat.","Kirstin is great. She really gets the class discussion going and provides meaningful feedback on papers. She makes herself available for office hours if you ever need help. If you follow the rubric she gives you for each paper, you will do fine, though I've struggled a bit with figuring out exactly what she wants from my papers.","Kirstin's syllabus gives you a perfect idea of how to get an A in her class and if you follow it, you'll be golden.  As an English major, I didn't find this class super challenging but some non-English majors really struggled with the material, since it's not modern English.  She's super willing to help/grant extensions/ whatever to get you an A/B","Class is extremely boring and she talks a lot about nothing. She'll rip you a new one if you attend class unprepared (i.e. no book, missing assignment). Her teaching methods are not efficient and isn't at all helpful during office hours. She is poorly paid and a poor excuse of an educator.","This class was fairly difficult for me, but she was willing to sit down and talk about the problems i had.

Even Shankland could not stay awake in lecture. Her exams were more straight forward than in MCB 150. All exam material comes from her lectures. Pay attention to all the details. This class weeds out the weak. Free iClicker points.","Dr. Wilson is  one of the best professors in the School of MCB. She genuinely cares about her students, and is an extremely fair grader. If you put in the effort she expects of you, you will do well. However, her classes are difficult. You have to work for your grade. But I enjoyed her classes enough to take every single one she taught at the time!","Overall this class sucked. Tests were so hard it isn't even funny. And seeing as tests are almost the only grade for the class... Its a shame, because I may have enjoyed the class if it was not so difficult. The only thing that is good about the class is the curve. As for Wilson, all she does is reads off slides.","This class was harder than I had heard from others. The tests are super tricky with short answer questions at the end worth 1/3 of test grade. Everything is off the powerpoints, but there is SO much information. The quizzes are really tricky too, but if she gives practice probs def look at those.","Love, love, love this class!  It is very difficult at first, but it enhances your problem solving techniques.  I have learned more in this class than all my MCB courses combined.  She is amazing, and knows her material.  She actually makes you think and not just memorize and forget everything after the test.","This class is one of the hardest MCB classes I have ever taken and I put in a lot of time. It was totally worth it though. If you go to office hours, go to class, and do a lot of practice exams you will do great. I went from getting a 47% to a 95% on my exams and got an A in the class bc of Dr. Wilson's awesomeness!","I really enjoyed this class. People who say that it is too hard are just plain lazy. If you pay attention and/or go to office hours, you'll do great.",Brenda Wilson is so hot.  She's a great professor too.,"Be PREPARED TO STUDY!!! This class is one of the most difficult classes I have ever taken, but you will learn a lot.  Study the practice exams and go to office hours to get the answers to these.

Have learned nothing. Not a fan.","I took this class in the Spring. There is only a midterm, group project, and a final. The class itself is not difficult, but you MUST attend to see the slides. He doesn't post them online. He grades a little hard, and getting an A is hard, but getting a B+ is easy. DO NOT buy the note packet from Notes 'n' Quotes because you won't use it.",This Spring 2009 semester I am taking Professor Wilson's Urban Geography class. He is very knowledgeable and funny. The only complaint is I wish he would post his slides for us to study from.

Although the class is based on relatively few grades, it is very interesting and I would recommend it to anybody seeking to gain an insight into spatial patterns of human geography.","Prof. Wilson's Geog 104 course is a course where only a few parts (3 tests, quiz section, term paper) make up the entire grade. This can be difficult because he does not use a textbook.  But overall he is friendly, amusing, and a pretty good professor.  You kind of can't help but like him.","Loves to refer to himself in the third person, which gets annyoying, but you can keep yourself busy by counting how many times he does it. Pretty funny guy, lectures aren't bad, but he doesn't put notes on line, and gives no guidance whatsoever as to what will be on the tests, anything he says is fair game.",It's fun to keep track of how many times he refers to himself in the third person during one lecture.,Incredibly funny guy who clearly loves teaching.,"Prof. Wilson is a very good teacher and scholar.  He doesn't give busy work, and he is very flexible.  The material is what matters to him.","A great teacher.  David is enthusiastic about his discipline and it shows in his classroom behavior.

Ruined my straight-A streak.",This class is ridiculous. She is EXTREMELY disorganized. The TAs are never informed because she never lets them know anything! Fails to get through the lecture notes necessary for the test and lab then complains about failing to do so because she arrives late to class.

Not terribly difficult to do well, but a decent amount of work.",The worst professor I have ever had BY FAR.  Her tests are ridiculous so study alot.

DRAMATIC, but nice guy. Lot's of homework, get help",Makes the class more difficult than necessary. Took the entire semester to grade papers so we didn't know our grade standings going into finals. HUGE final project at the end. Group work everyday. Go to office hours for help because he takes forever and a day to respond to emails. Can seem condescending and dramatic at times. Be prepared.,"Can come off as condescending. Is an extremely harsh grader, but if you can figure out what he likes you will get a decent grade. Accepting of most ideas, but he generally wants the discussion of a reading to go towards his perception of the it.",He is tooooo hard.,"He's not bad. He likes to exagerate a lot. But as long as u participate in discussion now and then, and follow the guide when writing a paper, you don't have to worry about getting a good grade. Dont be scared because the way he talks. Just stay cool and do ur thing","I pray to God that this is his last year of teaching for all incoming frsh.If you have him as your teacher, just drop his class right now.

And for a gened it requires a completely unreasonable amount of work. I don't exaggerate when I say it should really be 4 credit hours. Part of that workload is the difficulty of the tests (thus studying). DO NOT TAKE","Professor Wilson is biased, sassy, and unhelpful. He says a lot of unprofessional remarks like ""whatever,"" and his powerpoints are hard to follow because of the disorganization. Very boring/uninteresting lectures and the professor doesn't seem passionate in his teaching in the slightest bit. Do not take this class if you don't have to."

I would love to take his course again.","This professor is awful, and so is his MUS 130 class. Incredibly rude, and definitely agree with whats below, he is a very unapproachable person. MUS 130 is supposed to be for non-majors, but I believe this class would be extremely challenging even for music majors. Wilson is a terrible lecturer, and his exams are very tricky. Avoid at all costs.","Easily the worst professor I've had during my time as a graduate student. His lectures are monotonous, his grading criterion is incredibly vague, and as a whole he is pretty condescending and unapproachable.","This guy is INCREDIBLY rude. He has his head up his own ass, truly believes he's god's gift to earth, and thinks his position in academia gives him a right to treat students like trash. His assignments are bogus, he isn't specific about any grading criteria and then punishes you for it. He's also borderline racist and a keyboard warrior.","Great guy. Despite the fact that he doesn't seem to care about his students' opinions, I think he does. He's just very monotone. Regarding the political agenda that somebody else commented, he just cares a lot. He actually encourages us to take part (I respect that; it's tough!) Interesting guy, I've learned a lot about different types of music.",Pretty hard to take notes off of him - he purposefully puts minimal words on his slides but then goes on many tangents so it's not easy to follow him to write things down. Tests aren't hard but lots of readings. Make sure you get a good TA; that will make all the difference! Sometimes seems like he's pushing a political agenda. :(,"Really tricky exams,not clear on what's tested.It's a 100-level class and it's not even easy!","Difficult exams, no extra credit.

For example, if you write a sentence that is unclear because it is supported by the next sentence, you will still lose points for clarity.","I have taken countless hard english classes and write for a magazine. This class was genuinely interesting but was literally impossible. Got average grades, which does not work for my field (pre-med). I ended up dropping because she had terrible grading ways. Never knew why you did bad and she contradicted herself so much. Not approachable for help","Took this for my adv comp gen ed thinking it'd be interesting &amp; easy (it's supposed to be). It was neither. Essay every week which was expected, but she is the TOUGHEST grader I have ever had. Averaged a 7/10 on every essay, and that's where most of your grade comes from. Very contradictory and has high expectations. Good luck if you get her.","Honestly, I just needed an easy credit, and this lady comes in with her white guilt agenda and her obnoxious way of just talking in front of a class instead of teaching anything...","You need to write essay every week, and the average grade for essays is 7/10 for the class.",Obnoxious human being with the way she talks. Expects participation but is not very encouraging if you are incorrect. You have to go to class and the book is required.

However, if you email him, don't expect him to acknowledge every question. He usually sends one vague sentence back, which is frustrating for an online class.","He prepares a 90 minute lecture for a 50 minute class and always runs out of time. He walks back and forth a lot and uses excessive hand gestures, which I found distracting. Clearly he needs more improvement as a teacher- his TA is a better teacher than him. Classes are not too difficult though, and instructions are pretty straightforward.","Office hours by app't only. Once refused to meet me.

He's a cool guy but you really do need to work SUPER hard for an A. Do-able to get a B though.","This course was NOT a culture course, focusing rather on Japanese history. The weekly readings were a hodgepodge of different texts, making it hard to glean the right info from them. Lecture was mostly or entirely unrelated to the readings/tests, and the required books (which were oft full of interesting cultural commentary) were barely discussed.","Only take EALC if youre willing to read many papers a week and write three essays. Prof. Wilson is a great professor and lecturer, but only take this class if youre truly interested in this class.","Dr Wilson is a cool guy who clearly knows his stuff about East Asian history. He's pretty laid back and cares about us succeeding in the course and actually learning. Exams can be tricky. You will not survive on just lectures, you will have to read and read a lot. Not just the textbook, but also scholarly articles every other week, and three novels","Rod is a decent teacher who cares about the students and has interesting lectures. However, his course is not easy, since he requires a lot of reading and the three essays that students have to write are difficult. However, if you are willing to work, taking a class with him is a solid choice.","This class was about Global Environmental History, and it was great. Rod is cool being casual and we joked around a lot through class. I also learned a lot about environmental history and wrote a 15 page paper at the end of the semester, which is the goal of Hist 200, although most people write 10pg papers. He is one of my favorite profs ever.","Great teacher, very passionate about Japanese history. Exams were tricky since there was so much reading. do not put off this class as it will haunt you at the end of the semester","A fair amount of reading. I always procrastinated reading until the last few days before an exam; however, he allows a cheat sheet to be used on tests (which saved my life. I swear I wrote in a 6pt font). Read everything and spend some quality time on the essays. Re-read the chapters as well.","Overall a very nice and reasonable teacher. The class is insanely hard though. He does not take attendance in lecture, but there are absurd amounts of reading. 4 exams and 3 1000-word essays. This class requires a lot of your time for you to do well. Avoid the course if you can, but if you have to take it, he's probably the best option.",Very helpful and approachable. One of the best professors I've had.,"I initially came into the course hoping to learn more about my culture as a Japanese, this did not happen. While titled as a ""culture"" course, it was everything but. He requires you to memorize fine details of Japanese history. Sadly, the lectures do not pertain to the course as he starts lecture 20min late with going off on multiple tangents.","You WILL need to use the books if you want to pass the class. Is more of a history class than culture, but of well. Very nice and very informative. If you have a live of history, then this is for you!","INSANE amounts of reading that require you to remember abstract questions for the tests. However, the class was interesting, although he tends to waste the first 10-20 minutes explaining non-lecture things.","The class was very interesting, with interesting presentations, but a lot of reading, sometimes very boring, though the military/art side of Japan is interesting. He is a great professor, and you can get a good grade by simply reading, and understanding broad topics, not like ""when did this happen"", you will like this class if you give it time.","An overall nice and helpful professor, but the amount of readings he gives is incredible.

The lectures are long to emphasize the effects of exercise.,"Ken is super passionate about the information in this class, and that rubbed off on me. There are three non-cumulative essay-based exams that were tough, but doable if you studied and went to class. Class was not mandatory but necessary if you want a good grade. He was a little scatter-brained sometimes but kept everything concise and to the point!","This class is very laid back, and Dr. Wilund is a pretty cool professor.

He is arrogant. The labs are fun and interesting. I did not learn much from the actual lectures, I taught most of the information to myself.","Class is actually pretty difficult.  You have to go to class and pay attention during class to succeed.  There are random quizzes, so you should look over your notes before classes.","He's really funny, his lectures were somewhat enjoyable, but the class is tougher than you'd expect.

If you attended class you won't have to worry about the exams.,"I came into the topic of ""The Politics of Foreign Aid"" almost oblivious. But by the end, I knew SO much about it. His slides are jam-packed with information, he assigns interesting readings, and he is very helpful in guiding your studies/research papers. By far, one of the most effective, most memorable professors of my undergraduate experience."
1901610,2.3,John,Wirtz,11,0.3569181875674169,"He's really not as bad as these reviews say. If you go to class and to his office hours, he's helpful and will tell you what you need to do to succeed. But you HAVE to go to lecture. He posts outlines of slides online but the majority of exam material is things he says in lecture. He also gives 3 analysis assignments that make you apply concepts.","I really enjoyed this class. His tests are not super easy. He provides an exam outline and highlights important terms on the slides. The short answers are pretty obvious. GO to class he puts examples on the slides and they will appear on the exams. Don't miss attendance points, and do the extra credit and you'll do fine. He's a good professor!","horrible, horrible, horrible. I would never take Wirtz again. His lectures are impossible to pay attention to and the exams are close to impossible. Avoid his class.",I didn't think he was as bad as everyone made him out to be. His class is interesting since he ties in current events to help explain things. It's easy to expect what he wants because he highlights important notes in his slides. Only downside are his test formats like everyone said. Also does a few in-class participation assignments so show up.,"John Wirtz is really a character, let me tell you. His boring lectures pretty much put me to sleep and it is a struggle to go. Unusual personality but a dry sense of humor. He invented the term ""media snacking"" and asked us all to tweet about it to get his word trending. Tests are so hard it hurts and every question has almost every letter in it","Content is relevant if you are into public relations/journalism, but often does not make content compelling. Also, kind of rude. Often will call out people for looking on cellphones even though everyone has a computer; kind of hypocritical. Teaching style is lecture heavy with decent amount of reading.","Wirtz has gotten a few bad reviews but honestly he's not that bad of a guy. His lectures are interesting and he makes it clear what he wants you to know. The only thing I don't like are his exams. He has options A,B,C- Only A &amp; B- etc. and it makes you second guess yourself. In order to pass the exams you HAVE to study at least 3 days in advance.",Wirtz is one of the most paranoid professors I have ever come across. He will call out students during class for taking pictures of the slides and gets smart when students ask him to slow down. His cynical and condescending attitude is really off putting. How he has ever had any job involving interactions with other humans is beyond me.,"Hated him. Very difficult exams. His questions were always a, b, c, a&amp;b, all of the above type. Asks stupid questions on exams like what did wirtz say about... Random participation 8 times throughout the semester, doesn't post notes online, lots of work in the last 3 weeks of class. Very overwhelming","A bit full of himself and a weird teaching style, but he's fair. All of the information on the tests is covered in lecture (important stuff highlighted). He has so much knowledge to offer if you can get past him being a little preachy. I am certain that I've benefited from taking this class because of the content, and the rest is fine if you try.","What a self-righteous junky egotistical piece of mashed potatoes. Never wrote a book but routinely asks ""what did wirtz say about..."". Tests are WAY too specific, asks a, b, c, a and b, a b c and d. Most BS professor I've ever had in all of professorship. Doesn't matter how prepared you are, it matters how much he likes your particular class."

Professor Wise is an amazing professor, he's funny and good lecturer, discussions were always entertaining. The class ADV 281 as a whole is hard so dont blame the professor for your own shortcomings. Go to class, take notes, study, and you'll do fine.","Wise was almost the complete opposite of all these reviews I read before I took this course. If you go to lecture, take notes, and do all the assignments it is a very dull but somehow interesting course. Though there are no test preps, by going through notes and studying them the tests will not be difficult at all. I enjoyed Wise and the course.","Overall, seems like a nice guy. But with 0  materials to help you prepare for exams or even to review lectures you are pretty much on your own. His self righteous attitude towards the class is off putting and as someone who is not an ADV major, it was an extremely hard to pass. This is not a class with any give or wiggle room. Advise not taking","The worst ADV professor, ever. Always referring to the syllabus whenever being asked, even though the one that you don't understand too he demands you to read it for his answer(s). Not giving a clear guideline for assignments and no guides at all for exams. Lectures are mostly heavy-empty and he does not give you outlines for that. So good luck.",He told the class to email him if there was still confusion about a specific assignment...I emailed him and he asked me if I was in class the day he went over it... (this was the same day I was in class when he told us to email him for more questions).,If an assignment is due you better be to class real early or he literally will not accept it and you receive a 0. His lectures are quite unclear as he goes off on random tangents. The quizzes had questions that have never been covered even if you went to class and did the online readings. Not much respect for his own students.,"Extremely helpful, knowledgeable professor. Will put in the time for students who also put in the time!","i can't understand why there are so many negative comments. To be honest, Kevin is a very strict professor. He does not accept you homework if you are late for class. He always has a poker face. His tests are always hard. But anyway I did learn a lot from this course. It's the best advertising class I have ever had.",The class was pretty tough but I learned a ton of very applicable information.,WORST PROFESSOR EVER. IF YOU ARE LATE BY ONE MINUTE TO CLASS THEN YOUR HOMEWORK RECEIVES A ZERO. ONLINE QUIZZES ARE UP FOR 48 HOURS ONLY. IF YOU MISS IT YOU MISS IT FOR GOOD. NO REVIEW MATERIAL OR ANY HELP BEFORE THE TEST AND EXAM WHATSOEVER. LECTURES DON'T HELP.,"tests are hard, lectures are long and boring.  always tries to remember the name of students who speak in the class, which is useless.  zero tolerance on late submission of homework-- you will get zero if you are late for even 1 second. homework are complicated but he seldom explains. notes are important but he never provides slides after class","He does not clarify how to do the assignments unless you ask. Pay attention in class, even the details. The problem with his lecture is that he does not emphasize those little details and then he has them on the tests and quizzes. But you can find those information in the book. Read&amp;pay attention then you won't complain about his class.","What people have said on here is a bit unfair. He does try; it's the students who don't care. He is actually a nice person as long as you aren't rude. If you show up to office hours, he is always there and will work to build a relationship with you and give you great feedback. He knows his stuff and will do all he can to help those who actually try","Wow this guy is 1 of a kind. NOT FUNNY at all, TRIES to remember students names all semester and its extremely annoying and unnecessary. Tells people to get off laptops (I pay for this class I can quietly do what I want). Won't consider accepting assignments 1 second late (leave previous class early). Shouldn't be teaching anywhere, especially here","He's a horrible professor. He's a PhD from Stanford, so I thought I'd learn a lot from him but it was the worst possible ADV class I have ever taken. It made me question my major. If you enter class a minute late he won't accept your assignment and you'll get a 0.  Also his assignments make no sense and have no relevance to anything. Avoid the guy","The guy is absolutely terrible, he is full of himself and condescending and the class material would be easier if it wasn't for his weak powerpoints. Avoid him if you can, he seriously needs to reevaluate how he conducts himself with students.","Seriously you can be a minute late for class and he gives your assignments a 0. If you talk to him about it in a mature matter, he shoots back defensively and very condescending. He isn't clear about what is on tests, the readings have nothing to do with the tests (But he will tell you to study the readings for a test) His power points are useless.","If your a minute late to class on days your supposed to turn in an assignment its a 0 and all hopes for an A are gone. Don't pick him as a professor. He thinks he's funny but he's not. He also wears a step counting bracelet and walks back and forth in class. He emphasizes learning names, but never remembers anyway.",I put a lot of effort into this class. I tried really hard. He did not seem to care that our class average for tests were 70%; he grades hard. You have to go into office hours to see exactly what you did wrong on a quiz/test/assignment. A lot of material. Seems like a decent guy but comes off as condescending if you don't participate.,"Assignments: Vague questions and harsh grading. Tests: Very poor description of what will be on the test and tests typically have things never gone over in class. Personality: Seems like a nice guy, but with a couple tweaks he could fix up his class. Unfortunately this rating is based off of what I experienced. My apologies."

If you are the kind of person who just want to get it over with, he's easy on both homeworks and tests. However, he will seldom give you intuition or motivation. If you're into being self-taught the material, he is the one","He has really bad lectures but his lecture notes are the best! Honestly buy his lecture notes and you can just skip class. Do show up to office hours, where if you couldn't work on your homework, just ask him and he will spoonfeed the solutions to you. He is really funny and his stories are the only reason I go to class.","One of the most experienced professors on campus. Many of us know how quantum physics can be too abstract at times, his lecture notes make it very intuitive by explaining concepts through analogies from classical physics ( which is way more intuitive). Take the man's class and you'll be gucci with ur grades/quantum physics knowlege. The guy is a G.","Awesome professor. Very patient and helpful, especially with homework questions. Exams are in-class, open-book/note. Lecture attendance not mandatory but very beneficial.","Professor Wiss is decent, but not the best.

Professor Wissa is a nice person and cares about her students, but she can be a little too quick to judge sometimes. Her exam policy is very flexible.

Some of it was interesting but would probably not take again.,"I took English 241 with Witte and was very optimistic about the class before starting school. While the work load and reading requirements caught me off guard, and the close reading response papers were obnoxious in my schedule, I genuinely walked out of class with a better understanding of the readings.","I feel like we did not have to buy the book to learn the material she taught us, so you may get by without the book. Just lots of writing and her grading is unclear. I didn't  really understand what she wanted and it was difficult to get in touch with her.","She's very lecture heavy and difficult to understand when she lectures because she talks over herself. This makes it incredibly difficult to perform well on the papers, which there are lots of, and she's a tough grader. For some reason, whenever I went to see her in office hours for help, she was not there either--even when I double -checked times.","Don't take her. She is completely unorganized, doesn't seem like she knows what she is doing, and only assigns busy work to fill class time it seems.

Do old exams on your own.",Physics 213 is not a well laid out course.  It is sort of a combination of Thermodynamics and Statistics.  Wolfe could never decide whether to do demos or explain the material.  He also was a jackass to me when he caught me reading a newspaper.,"Bad teacher for a course that has the toughest material in the 211-214 series. Wastes a lot of time (first 10-20 minutes) Talking about things that aren't necessary to talk about before the lecture (in other words, material that is covered later in the lecture).","The course was pretty hard, and Wolfe didnt make it any better by being a terrible teacher.

If you missed a class, don't expect much help getting hte notes unless you took it with friends.  Taking notes is difficult because he has no set presentation.

The homework was hard, but fair and fun to work through. He also strictly sticks to his office hours, don't try to ""pop in"" with a quick question...","He's not the easiest professor to take this class with, but he's BY FAR not the hardest. You can tell that he puts a lot of work into trying to teach us about these hard concepts. The homeworks were a little hard, however. Expect to go to office hours/stay up late working on homework.","Wong is a decent lecturer but is very well organized. Unfortunately he can sometimes be quite dry when lecturing, but he puts in the effort to try and make lecture as interesting as possible. He's also very dedicated to making sure everyone understands the material, and he's more focused on students learning the actual material.","It WAS a 400-level class and is expected to be challenging, but he could have made it much easier just when it came to knowing what we were supposed to be learning. The lectures really weren't helpful with the homework and tests. He is obviously a really smart guy, but it's just frustrating when he can't explain things to us non-geniuses.","It's near impossible to fail this course if you complete the homework assignments on time.  Tests were a tad more difficult than the practice tests led me to believe.  Still, if you've got a good grasp of basic algebra, you're more than qualified for this gen-ed.  He's more than willing to help students who have questions, however.","Pretty easy teacher, but material on tests are covered too much. You have to read the book to understand anything.","Tony Wong is a funny guy and all, but his tests are ridiculous! They are never anything like the practice exams! Also they grade homework way too hard. Online quizzes are an easy A. You will need the book. Take this class if you like math/physics, but otherwise don't, it's a tricky GenEd."
1647025,2.2,Jessica,Wong,2,0.3433084942432002,Not the best when it comes to teaching. Struggles to convey ideas clearly. Attempts to stick to rigid plan for each class so she asks questions looking for specific answers from us. It's just like we're filling in the blanks for her. Tries too hard to pull ideas from books that just aren't there. Pretty frustrated with her teaching style.,Easy but boring class. Graded the papers easy but class just dragged on
1861169,3.4,Melissa,Wong,4,0.437543680126372,I'd pass on her class unless you want an easy class. Considering what I paid I should have taken something with more meat. Read articles. Say what you think. She's ok with that. Very constructovist. I want to know how the world works so I can get a job. Watch out for projects. If your project looks less than others you are down graded.,"LOVED this class. I learned so much, and her lectures were always engaging. I knew exactly what to work on with assignments and expectations were really clearly stated.","Took a few classes.   Needed hours.  Content normal, no new.  She just repeats what the students say.   It's not a ""present knowledge and educate the student"" type of class.  It's ""whatever the student thinks is ok, their ideas shape the class.""  One project, I met the requirements.  Others did more.  I got graded down.  Wouldn't discuss it with me","I can see why students might not enjoy Professor Wong's teaching style. You have to want to succeed and be willing to work for it. If you're not willing, don't bother taking her classes.  She's an excellent professor if you're going to make an effort, and if you really care about what the subject matter. I would love to take another class with her."

He's super lenient on things and is really interesting to listen to, since even if you don't care about the subject his passion for it will draw you in. Super nice guy and nice teacher, would definitely recommend.","Start off by saying i am extremely passionate about the environment and i took a pseudo environmental course with him. He was a great professor and is understanding and caring if you display you are actually putting the work in. That being said, the ""work"" was really not that much. The class is challenging, but by no means hard.","Course was entitled ""Green Romanticism""; considered the effects of contemporary climate events on British Romanticism and its trends. Homework was a rare occurrence. Papers were well explained. The midterm was fairly graded. Participation is huge. Overall, it was a pretty interesting class and the professor was great.",Great Professor (funny)! Really tries to get you engaged in the material,"While he was very enthusiastic about the subject matter, he is very unclear in teaching. Class consisted of reviewing the hw and having him attempt to get us to see his perspective with little direction. He is unclear on expectations and is easily frustrated when his mysterious expectations aren't met. Not a hard class but he is a poor professor.","Extremely knowledgeable and intelligent guy. His anecdotes on his experiences were amazing. I do however, think this course is too new to excel in. I found myself thinking the material was sometimes pulling at straws... which in turn made it extremely difficult to write papers with an accurate analysis on the subject matter.","Prof Wood is an enthusiastic, bright professor and a great guy, but 210 is not his best class. He assigned us to read Barchester Towers (800 pp) in a SURVEY class. For that book I read Sparknotes and went to the lecture and I did fantastic. Go to lecture and bring your text--it'll help you know what passages will be on exams.","Took the Jane Austen class with Prof Wood. Class was excellent, full of energy and exciting. He keeps the class engaged. Grading was fair. Must keep up with the readings. 2 papers. Take a class with Wood if you can!","gillen wood loves art. he loves talking about art. consequently his words have no value or meaning. if you want to listen to a professor who is interested in your perspective, then you'd better be some kind of art venerating hippie because this guy just wants to be into anything his feelings tell him to be.","Lectures started strong but deteriorated throughout the semester.  Semester fatigue or laziness?  Both the final and midterm were difficult for a required English big lecture course.  Exams did not really fit the lectures.  Good prof, but I think many of the other comments are inflated.","Everyone says Wood is the best professor, but I was disappointed. I wasn't captivated,enthused, or suddenly hit with a realization as to why I am an English major. Nonetheless, his class is alright. Don't dread it, but don't get pumped, either.","Everyone says Wood is the best professor ever, but I was disappointed.

Insightful commentary on the various pieces of literature interspersed with humor and wit. I'd definitely love to take another class with him.","The Best teacher I've ever had!!!! He made realize why I am an English major.  His lectures as well as his teaching style are interesting, amazing, and captivating","A great teacher.  His lectures were so interesting that he keeps your attention 95% of the time... and I took it in the summer.  Definitely a great great teacher, rare in these days.",Brilliant. Lectures are engaging and peppered with witty banter and giggle-inducing observations. Definitely try to get this guy.,"Absolutely Brilliant. His knowledge of Romantic poets will have you reading Wordsworth and Keats outside of class. His lectures are entertaining, eloquent, and engaging. The fun Australian accent is also a plus. Brilliant man - read ""The Shock of the Real"" if you can find it at the library.","Awesome professor. Very nice, animated and funny in lecture, and gives interesting, clear interpretations of the readings. Wish I could have him again!","Prof. Wood is the best professor I've had--he is incredibly adorable, sweet, brilliant, and funny. He's been the only professor so far that has made me comfortable enough to speak in class regularly. Romantic poetry is already so lovely, but when he reads it, it's simply amazing. I am heartbroken he's not teaching next semester!"

I would highly recommend her as a rhet 105 teacher!,"Assignments require time to complete and the quantity is a lot, so brace yourself as Elaine may cut some marks.

It is still very organized, and not that bad.",I've had this professor for multiple classes and he is truly one of my favorite professors on campus. He comes to lectures with a lot of energy so you don't need to worry about them being boring. He is also very accommodating with meeting students outside of class to explain things. Overall if you have this professor you're in good hands,"Lectures are mandatory, but for the most part they are completely useless. He ""teaches"" about CAD or Matlab, however you have to teach most of the information to yourself. His TA writes and grades the assignments, so most of the time what is taught and the homework don't match up. Also if you mess up be prepared for a snarky arrogant response.",The lectures were not useful. His assignments were straight forward. His TA will help you if you show up to office hours. He had an english TA grade our essays. NO! We are engineers in training not english majors. That sucked. She butchered my grade and the grades of others. I'm sure my class of aero students hate her. I do.,A great enthusiastic professor. He was always in the lab after hours looking to help and was very understanding if you couldn't get the cad to work. It's more homework than a 2 credit class normally but if you do the work you'll get the A.,"Very good at teaching. His instructions are clear, his assignments are reasonable and he's willing to improve based on student feedback. He's also very friendly and approachable.","Come to class, do the fairly easy CAD assignments. Quizzes are simple. Hardest part is the project he gives you, no final test just have to make CAD plane."

Tests are tricky,"Prof. Woodbury is so funny, she cracks me up every time i go to lecture! She is so random, and she is funnier if you pretend that she is a big grass smoker. The MPs take FOREVER if you are not computer-brained like me, but you will eventaully figure it out.  The tests are really hard because they try to trick you. i got a B","Woodbury is quite goofy.  However, pretty easy class.  Although normally worthless, the lectures give hints as to what is expected to show up on tests and MPs.  MPs are time consuming but for sure do-able.  I will never use coding again in my life..but found the class pretty simple and somewhat enjoyable.","Utterly useless professor. Didn't know how to code her way out of a paper bag. The MPs were insanely easy and the entire class is a blow-off. If you manage to get below an A, college isn't for you.","Class was great, other than the fact that it ran for 2 hours and was boring. At least the students were social in the small (30 student) setting.","She is a very difficult teacher and bitter. Make sure you attend class. Key to this class is mps. Final was easy, but still the hardest class i've taken.",Woodbury is kind of out there. Would always give us weekly updates on sports scores. Go to lectures when you can. Online homeworks are easy. Make sure you have a good group for MP. You have control over how well you do on exams. Study old exams. Should be able to pull off an B/A.,I love Professor Woodbury! I went to Gambill's lecture but would usually email Professor Woodbury when I had trouble on MPs or difficulty with material. She always writes back (usually extremely fast as well!) in detail explaining what needed to be done or what was done incorrectly. So helpful!,The class was not bad. The lecture are not mandatory but I would suggest going if you want a good grade. STUDY THE PREVIOUS EXAMS! It will really help you.,"an awful class. the lectures are utterly pointless. this is one of the classes that i gained nothing out of. i highly recommend not taking this class.

If you go to lecture and your lab session, you should at least get a B. Mayne exam questions try to trick you so pay attention to what happens when the code is wrong and details such as that. The quizzes online are easy points. I only used/needed the lecture notes out of all the books.","I used to go to Gambill and it was a fun class, but I switched to Woodbury because she covers the material in a way I liked more.  I found I could concentrate better.  With her help and the awesome T.A's, I really enjoy the class!","Boring class, but easy if you know what's in the course guide.","She doesn't really know her material that well, which is too bad because it is somewhat interesting material.

Grading and Piazza are 100% handled by the TAs. Your only actual teacher in this class is StackOverflow, since even the documentation the class provides in insufficient. Professor is a complete non-factor in this class, be ready to learn a lot of code on your own.","There's no actual grade normalization. This means that you get whatever grade your moderator gives you, which means certain moderators will definitely give you a higher grade and you don't get to pick.",He didn't keep up with what was previously mentioned. Way too much subjectivity and no actual normalization.,Keeps lectures short and realizes if he doesn't have anything else to say.

I strongly recommend taking one of her classes.(:","Lectures are vague, uses the book but doesnt utilize in class much, usually on phone during class time, microaggressions towards students, expects students not to form assumptions yet she does, can be very passive aggressive, class allowed students to learn more than surface stuff about each other but failed to connect course content at times",By far my favorite professor I have ever had in the Communication department. Wasn't afraid to discuss hard topics and really cares for her students. Her office is literally always open and the most helpful professor I ever had- even outside of the classroom. There were 2 projects and exams were easy.

Compared to another new professor for ACCY 304 in Spring semester, Wu is better because he is not strict at all. Wu is a really nice person. Although I almost never participate in the class, I got 90+ for attendance. Memory is key.",Professor Wu does not conduct class in the most interesting way but he does make the class very straightforward in terms of what will be on the exams. If you show up you will get full participation points and he grades presentations and other assignments very leniently. Exams are all standardized by the department so every prof has the same exams.,"HE IS THE WORST PROFESSOR EVER! He doesn't genuinely want to help students learn or do better. He is very difficult to communicate with and acts selfishly towards his own interest which is research than spending time with students or teaching. Even if he seems to know the content, his attitude towards teaching and students disqualify the standard.","Wu is not really the best lecturer and he is very vague about what exactly is going to be on the exams. However, his exams were very easy and I received an A while putting in minimal work.",He thinks he is smart. Unfortunately not. He is not good at teaching at all worst professor ever,"The guy knows what he's talking about. Yes, he has an accent, but it's not difficult to understand him.  You don't book a single journal entry, but you do have to apply concepts of internal control systems. This involves thinking of the bigger picture which is probably why accounting majors struggle. Less memorization, more application of concepts.","I cant speak for entier class. But my experience with Prof. Wu was great. I took it at Fall 201. Martin even gave me the textbook!! He is knowledgable and experienced. The class was hard b/c content is so tangible but Martin teaches you to think rather just to study like a monkey. Although I got B, which is disappointed, I would recommend him!!","You are very lucky to see this message. I knew Wu would not be very good, but he still surprised me. The class was more than boring. I've been there every classes but still learned nothing. I cant agree more with one comments above: even TA fell asleep in his class. Grading criteria is a mystery. Two words for all of you: Just Dont!","He was difficult to understand at times and likes to go off on tangents that are irrelevant to the course.  The class lasts nearly 2 hours but, could easily be 1.  He is not willing to help students and is more involved in his research.  The TA slept every class period or texted. He does not take your viewpoint into consideration. Overall, not good","Wu is a knowledgeable prof, but is very hard to understand. Let's students do most of the teaching for him, yet disagrees with most students' viewpoints. Extensive case assignments (14 individual, 2 group). Does not utilize compass for whatever reason. Overall would recommend taking 304 with someone else.","Unless your views match his, he pretty much discounts what your opinion. It's annoying how little structure there is to the class and how smart he thinks he is. The class was interesting at first, until I realized the professor and material was all smoke and mirrors. Participation is a huge chunk of your grade and you have a case due most everyday.","Wu is an awful, awful professor.  He teaches you literally nothing, yet he acts like the class is so important.  It is a total waste of time and is pure busy work.  The previous poster that said dumb kids feel smart is completely correct.  These topics are common sense, and a lot of dumb kids get really into discussing the simpleton topics with him",No Comments,"Eh... so so professor.  He thinks he is a lot smarter than he really is because he has the best answers to questions, but I would hope that the professor would have better answers.  Really forces you to think, which is good, but classes really really lacks any kind of structure.",He is very passionate about teaching. Many of teh negative comments on here are there because the material is very intangible. Class is what you make of it. He teaches you to think rather than to take tests with identical problems as given in class like a monkey. If you have an entreprenuerial mindset you will like class because youll apply it.,"He is passionate about his teaching, but he can easily get on your nerves..I would recommend not taking him..also, he would never directly answer your question.","worst class i've ever taken, worst teacher i've ever had, common sense yet i got an awful grade, can't understand what he says and if you could it'd be worthless anyway, class lasts full two hours, stupid kids feel smart because material is so simple and participate extensively, just drawing out the overall suffering, ahstrategicahhsystemsahhproach"

Not only her course is boring and hard, she also shows her abhor towards those who do not regularly come to class. She's making the quizzes and exams much harder than usual and she rarely gives partial points for a question that you do partially correct. Do remember to avoid her!","She makes this class so much harder than necessary. If you don't go to lecture you will definitely be in trouble, she doesn't have a website or post grades. Maybe my learning style just didn't click with her teaching style, but I found her tests and quizzes really difficult even though I did all the hw, studied a lot, and went to every lecture.","Professor Wu really did try her best to be a great professor, but her delivery made the class more difficult than it had to be.  Her board work was sloppy, and often times she was talking so quietly that it was hard to hear her.","Easy A. Weekly quizzes are a breeze if you do the homework correctly. Exams are very easy. Boring lecturer and it's kind of tough to understand her sometimes, but she knows what she's talking about and she can explain things clearly if you ask. If you're smart, you can get by this class quite easily by reading the book instead of going to lecture.","Have no idea what she is talking about in class some time. Her vocal delivery is terrible, she can't explain herself very well. Her grading was just not making any sense and she can't give a detailed explanation for any of her grading. She just simply say:""I don't understand what you are doing."" Anyway, never take her class!!","she spent like 2 extra weeks on a section because she knew the class didnt understand it. in those 2 weeks, she just continued to repeat the same things over and over again. by the end of the class, she informed us that we were so far behind and we only did the minimum requirement for the course as if it was our fault.  she was just a bad teacher.",terrible teacher. i cant understand her and her quizzes are impossible.,"Very unclear in her teaching. However, there were no tricks on any of her tests. Quizzes were unnecessarily hard. There was a clear gap between those who got it and those who didn't. She let those who didn't get it fall and she was very unsympathetic towards them. Office hours were hardly worth it. Would not recommend.","She is very clear with the materials. Quizes and hw due every friday. Attendence is recommended because it is harder to read the book. Exams are fair. As a math major, this course is easy and I get 100/100 on every stuff with weekly &lt;60min work. Don't hesitate to take her class and you will definitely learn a lot.",Professor Wu is pretty clear when it comes to expectations and she's thorough with the material. I liked that.  I did not like quizzes every Thurday (which she gave you like 2 minutes to do) and tests where solutions end up being horrendous.  I thought I was going to do well...until I took the final.  I'm kind of mixed about this professor.,,"If you don't have a basic of complex number, Pr. Wu is a great choice. She explains problems step-to-step. Although her voice makes you sleepy, the class fits students who study complex number first time. Her exams are not difficult (no proofs, just basic problems in the book, do all problems in the book so you'll be fine)","I really couldn't understand her in class, and office hours were just as bad.  A major communication barrier existed, and the difficult material just made matters worse.  The book used was poor in quality, and her exams were only somewhat like the book problems."

He's not very patient and tends to rush through his responses to students' doubts. But he's knowledgeable and passionate, which is more than you can ask for to pass this course. Just keep up with WebAssign and always attend section!","Good and clear professor. He sometimes gives off an attitude like he doesn't want to be there, but you kind of just get used to it.","It was tough learning all of the disparate material, not to mention taking my first proof-based class, but I would highly recommend Dr. Wyser. He was really accessible, and his notes were clear and concise. I had to do a lot of reading from the text to get it, though. And the homework was pretty challenging at times.","Wonderful lecturer. As a math minor, he really helped me develop my mathematical maturity. His lectures were clear and informative, and helped me fill in the gaps that the book missed. I would highly recommend taking him as your first upper-level math professor.","Prof. Wyser is not very good at proof-based math. Porf. Wyser don't like to use definition, which make me feel he is not a good mathematician. So, his lecture will not help you to build a math foundation. And I can never understand why a math lecturer emphasis so much on attendance.",He is a cute professor. His exams were not very difficult. He answered emails quickly and tried his best to help students.,"His lectures are awesome. Sometimes he looks like he is angry but he is not. He is just tired (maybe not, but he doens't hate you!). He cannot be a mean person because he has three daughters. Also, he is very very smart and the grading is not harsh. He is teaching next fall so I recommend this class. p.s. I think he is nice.","He did good at lecture but not good at being individually asked problems. His lecture is very clear and he did well on notes on the blackboard. However, he would get annoyed quickly when you have some difficult questions.","Overall he is a very intelligent man, and he does do an excellent job giving lectures in class, as they are easy to follow. He writes legibly and stays consistent in notation. The class difficulty and workload is manageable. The big problem, though, is he does send vibes that he doesn't want to teach. In office hours, he gets very annoyed quickly.","Early in the semester, he seemed like he did not want to be there at all, but he seemed more invested in the class as it went on.  He improved a lot and made class worthwhile."

I would give him 5 stars!,"Great professor, but I feel like there were too many review classes where we just went over previous material. Gives handouts, and tells you what to expect on midterms/final. Watch out though, as the final is worth 40% of the grade",He gives handouts every lecture. You will want those handouts if you don't want to read the book. He will give you extra credit problems every quiz or exam.  Quizzes and exams are relatively easy comparing to other sections. And he usually will review topics covered in tests in the previous lecture. So show up!,"Prof. Xiao gives really great, clear-cut lectures. He frequently asks if we understand what he just derived, and he actually looks at the class to see if anyone raises their hand. He assigns only enough homework to cover each type of diff. eq. we learn (4-8 problems a week). Overall a great professor."

He keeps things very clear and is really understanding of his students.,"His explaination is very clear, and his exames are very related(almost the same) to what he covered in class.

Project he has us use for the course is buggy and poorly documented. Slow at getting grades out and final exam format was weird (and included stuff we barely even touched on during lecture).

He was also very helpful when you asked him questions.  I heard he wasn't very good in ME 300, but that didn't carry over into 310.","Apparently yu was no good for 300 but I thought he great for 310. Good lectures, very enthusiastic and helpful with questions. And the tests are very representative of the homework, and graded very fairly. Plus the man is absolutely hilarious, but not on purpose i think...",Not recommended whatsoever.  Tests are nothing like hw. Spends most of class telling you how to study instead of the material. Uses word files for examples instead of a chalkboard/whiteboard.  One of our tests had an even dist. of grades from 10 to 90%.  Had no TAs. Don't make the same mistake as my friends and I; take only if you are a masochist,Attending lectures did not help much with this professor. He talked a lot about how to study and think instead of teaching the actual material. I do not recommend taking this professor.,"Prof. Yu spent too much time in class telling us how to study, not teaching the material. The only useful part of his lectures were the reviews when he explained everything in 3 lectures. His exams were easy though, completely based on the homework and examples from class (all of which he puts online!)","I didnt find him useful in office hours, I thought he needed TAs.  Hard to understand him.  I would not recommend him.",Good professor and did what he supposed to do.  Presented the material well and was helpful in office hours. Exams were tough but grading was excellent.,good lecturer. try hard enough and you'll get an A.,"This was a great professor, highly recommend him. Everything is straightforward and he is willing to help you during office hours. You just have to get past the accent.","Great Professor! He explains things clearly and his lectures are very helpful. Some homeworks can be tough but he can help explain them in his office hours. Exams arent easy, but they are fair. He grades not based on whether your numbers are correct but if you have the right thought process, so he gives a lot of partial credit.",Pretty fair professor. Thing is hes a physics major so a majority of his lectures will be spent deriving long equations. He is really straightforward in the sense that his exams wont attempt to trick you but they will test what you know. Expect to have to work a bit with this guy tho.,"Not only do I find this man very attractive but he is also an awesome teacher.  He knows how to explain and pronounces things funny.  For example fluid = friud, joule = jooor,  hot source = hot sauce.  This guy is amazing though...  if you have a choice get him as a teacher.",Explains theory clearly and is an easy grader on test.  Every test is based on homework problems except slightly more difficult.  Knows a lot about the subject and is easy to approach with questions.,Pretty good teacher.  Lectures were a little heavy on theory side.  Midterms and final were a little rough but graded leniently.  Class is much easier if you can find a homework solutions guide...

She curves the class, and tells us that she hates to even give a student a B-.  Also, she is very good about helping students get jobs and research opportunities.  The class is a alot of work but definately worth it.","This was an interesting class.  The tests weren't easy, but in the end, she really tries to give everyone a high grade.  Class participation is mandatory, but she is understanding on this too and always encourages people to talk."

He's very clear and wants to see his students succeed. Very easy to understand the material and answers any question you have. If you need extra help he gives you his time.,Great professor!  His lectures are very interesting and you'll learn quite a bit of new mathematics. Unfortunately the course is a little light on proofs. Read the textbook to fill in the gaps when it comes to proofs.

I really enjoy his class. he always willing to help you as long as he is not busy. he called me the funny guy I think he probably dont even remember my name.,The course is easy to earn A or A+ if you take all classes. The professor is humorous. And you will have review sections before every midterms as expected.,"give a few but instructing homework. the lecture is amazing and he will mention every detail of the proof and I bet all the students get his idea clearly. The homework is not that hard once you attend on his class. However, the bad thing is that he is just too popular and you have to make earlier plan to get in his class lol.","Nice man!

Great lectures and fair grades, any problems with your grades can be discussed with him.","This professor is an Amazing guy! He is knowledgeable, nice, awesome, full of knowledge and fun.

It's really hard to learn, and even harder to do well. Save yourself. Take 234 at a community college.",Zaki is not helpful at all.  The way he explains things is like a different language.

Be ready for long/difficult exams.  Book is n't necessary.  Take good notes, listen during reviews, practice the HW's and note examples.","I know it's hard to wake up for 8AM lecture, but this one is worth it. Gives very detailed notes, goes over good examples in class, and repeats the most important info. Exams were on the hard end of the spectrum, but that's more from having 1 hour for 4 problems than anything else.

And that his TAs aren't the best.  Overall a pretty easy class, with plenty of time to work on MPs and opportunities to ask for help.","Adorable sense of humor, though how cute can you be about CS? He will explain stuff and help you a lot if you go to office hours, so I recommend that. TAs are okay; of course it depends on the TA. Seems like Kai does all the work himself and the other teacher of the other section doesn't do squat, so he gets brownie points from me for that.","Actually pretty hilarious if you get his jokes. He at least keeps the lectures interesting, if not totally clear. His TAs are pretty awful, though.",Terrible speaker.  He tries to make friends with you and it gets kind of annoying.  The exams and homework ALWAYS have errors which they find later and give you credit for.  Overall if you study you should be okay.,"Not the greatest teacher, but you should get an A if you study enough."

Very helpful. Very direct presentation of material.,It is somewhat difficult to understand what he is explaining on the board but the exams are easy since the exam problems are very similar to the homework problems.,"Each day I had this class, it was probably the best part of my day.

Although homework/exams were somewhat tricky, he grades fairly. Hoping to take another class from him.","This class was really enjoyable--It was probably the best part of each day I had it.

His exams are either really easy or really hard.,"This guy fails at speaking english and at teaching.  He's boring, and is profoundly uninterested in teaching.

I knew 301 was going to be hard, but she only makes it 50 times worse. She drags class out the entire 1h 50 min. for no reason, she just reads off of power point slides and can't explain anything unless its on her notes. So much work, 10 cases and 3 individual cases.

The final is impossible. Applying the material is one thing, but trying to figure out where in the question the material IS is another thing entirely. She tries to act so naive (""I'm not Christian, I didn't know it was Easter"") but she really just doesn't want to take responsibility for being a terrible teacher.","Very annoying. Cannot explain material and answer students' questions, she really just reads off the powerpoint slides and makes unfair tests that are unrelated to lecture or the book. Its kind of hard to apply material when it was never explained well. The guy down there prolly got the answers from previous sections. Overall just stay away...",Don't take her class if you have another choice.,"Well she's cute.  I think thats the only reason I went to class.  However, she seems to not understand American values (I.E -- no one does work over spring break and therefore having a huge paper due the MONDAY after spring break is just silly).

But he is always willing to help.",You will never feel boring in his class.,"great professor, explain things super clear and gives very useful insights","Honestly the most straightforward class I've taken: lectures cover what's on the homework, discussion problem sets summarize the homework, and the exams cover the discussion problem sets. Plus, he had a great grading policy that rewarded continued effort in the class, replacing midterm grades with the corresponding part on the final if you improved","The young professor holds a high sense of responsibility and his lecture is very passionate and useful. The professor is very patient to answer questions and provide help during the office hour. Really nice teacher. And the course digs deep into the details and statistical theories of diverse statistical learning algorithms, which is useful.","Ruoqing is EXTREMELY humble, smart, and nice.

Don't slack!","When I took CS 126 with Prof. Zilles in its second semester, it was clear that the course hadn't yet fully matured. Rubrics came out late and could be confusing. Despite these setbacks, I really enjoyed 126. Zilles connected well with students, was entertaining, and very knowledgeable. Lectures were somewhat slow, but informative nonetheless.",Zilles is notorious for being mean to his students.

I also had him for my discussion and he is helpful at explaining discussion problems.,"He is a fantastic professor who is very good at explaining concepts, and always willing to answer your questions. But be sure to pay attention, because the class goes FAST, and the last 7 or 8 weeks covers a lot of challenging material! But all lectures are posted online, so it's not hard to learn the concepts you miss if you put in the time.",best professor EVER!!!!!!!!,"Craig is a wonderful teacher and amazing lecturer.  He teaches well while also throwing in humor to keep you interested in the material.  The class did seem to suffer from a lack of communication at times.  However, I screwed up on an exam by incorrectly submitting part of it, and Craig allowed me to do a makeup assignment as to not ruin my grade.","IMHO, the first 3/4's of this class is totally manageable. But around when midterm 6 hits, this class just went downhill. Not only that, we didn't really have much time to do SPIMBOT. Also, the last midterm was ridiculously hard (it's 20% of your grade) and studying from just course materials was not sufficient.","I'm very glad I took this course. I learned new things every day. This is the fairest course I've ever taken in terms of grading. That said, the lowest grade I've ever received was this class.","Class is fairly easy except for the fact that you learn nothing in lecture and learn 95% of the material in 5 minutes of discussion and doing labs. Then, he ruins your grade on a last test worth 10% more than the final. Which he follows up by not telling you any information about what's on/the format of the final and you inevitably fail that.",I LOVE CRAIG,Awesome teacher. The best CS professor at UIUC by far.

Second-chance exams, extra credit from quizzes...",He's very nice and gives a helpful lecture. I'd say he's pretty good at explaining the material.,"Sometimes assumes everyone has prior experience with Java, so his explanations are unclear for those of us who have not. The incredibly generous extra credit points makes up for the difficulty of the class, though. I would say his forte is in CS 398 and not 125, though.","He's honestly one of the best professors that the CS department at Illinois has. He's crystal clear, exceptionally helpful, and hilarious.

Pay attention in lectures; sometimes he'll give hints about exams. Do strongly suggested problems in book and practice exams.,"His lectures are decent, but filled with unnecessary tangents.

There is no homework or readings: grades are determined entirely off 5 exams, which are based entirely on his lectures. So go to lecture and study those lecture notes! Exams are challenging but fair. Zimmerman is kind and hilarious. There was an issue with one of my exam scores and he corrected it quickly and respectfully.",This is a tough class but the amount of resources available is astounding. The professor connects it to real life applications keeping you interested and seems to care about the success of his students with holding review sessions at the sacrifice of his own time and willingness to stay a few minutes after class everyday to answer your questions.,Mr. Zimmerman gives great lectures and does everything he can to help his students pass.
