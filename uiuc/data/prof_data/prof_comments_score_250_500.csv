If you don't go to class, you won't be able to study off them because there isn't a lot of writing. I think her tests are obnoxiously specific about the wrong kinds of information. Understanding the general way things work won't get you through it.","I don't understand how a lot of people thought this class was easy. I struggled a lot and a few others I know did as well. Her PowerPoint slides are VERY unclear, so you have to go to class. Her tests are super nitpicky, requiring that you know precise details. They are also unpredictable and challenging, making it feel like a 300/400 level course.",I didn't realize this course was super interesting until I had my third class. Then I started to ask questions and really felt engaged into it. It's so helpful to build up the psychology-wise critical thinking ability. Prof. Beck is so nice that she answered questions after every single class. And you don't need to buy a textbook at all!!!!!,She is a very nice professor. The content is very interesting and helpful. Students are required to give presentation on assigned reading.She will test you extremely detailed knowledge. The lecture is enjoyable and fun though. Pay attention to details.,"Not an easy A, but worth the effort. Such a nice professor, she's never condescending and encourages questions and discussion. Maintains a really good learning environment and explains complex concepts in an easy to understand way. Great teacher, and a really interesting class.","Loved this class! So interesting. Never read assign readings! Print out power points!! Take them to class and take notes on what she says!! She explains everything flawlessly and what she says are questions on the test. I would recommend this class to anyone, just go to class (she explains charts) and it is an easy A+","Never read assigned readings. Lectures are on Compass so you don't have to go to class - although it will probably help you understand better. Overall, easy class.","Beck is a very knowledgeable professor, the topics in class are very interesting- it is very beneficial to attend lectures because her slides are explained in detail &amp; explanations are necessary to do well on exams!! Overall, recommended!","pretty easy class, dont need to attend all of them, there was no textbook, used just research articles. shes hot too",The class is hard!,Great class!  Learned a lot.  Very knowledgeable professor.
1044213,2.5,Paul,Beck,5,0.4322097617923317,Worst professor I have had in the COB. To say he's disorganized is an understatement. He is constantly corrected by students and regularly sends corrections of solutionsslides because he didn't do them correctly the first time. DO NOT TAKE BECK FOR 510.,Completely disorganized. Do not take him for this class. Good luck if you do.,"This class can be challenging if you do not do the readings and lectures. The workload is a fair amount, but there's a reason for that. Professor Beck is very approachable. The reason I rated helpfulness as a 5 is because this class will prepare you for the audit portion of the CPA (which is why you're taking this course). Take 515 with Beck.",No use of textbook at all. Everything comes straight from lectures. Reading is assigned but definitely not required. Go to class because a lot of the grade is participation and he would just give my group good grades because we were there all the time and participated. Make sure someone in your group is solid in finance bc there is lots of math.,"very unorganized and doesn't explain well when teaching at times. but he definitely knows his stuff and is very passionate about accounting. test grading is questionable at times also. learned a lot, but way too much work and i felt tests were graded unfairly (didn't accept alternate opinions as if he were grading a math problem)."

He had the homework due at 9:00 and the lecture started at 9:30, so you had to come a half hour early for no reason.","Lectures were not incredibly clear. Oftentimes it felt as though the material in the textbook was just being repeated, however topics that were unclear were not made much better by the lectures.","He and Makins traded off lectures, so I got to experience both of them. I personally learned better from Beck, but Naomi's lectures were definitely more fun. They both know their stuff and care about the students. It's hard to go wrong in the physics department.",He has a very straightforward teaching style. His lectures are simply PowerPoint presentations. His teaching is formula-based and not very conceptual. The prelectures are basically the same as his lectures,"If you can learn from video 'prelectures' and a professor that doesn't teach you anything, this is the class for you.","Beck is a good teacher and a nice guy.  The entire class is taught off of smartphysics, which makes lectures occasionally pointless.  He has a lot of demos and enjoys teaching.  Maybe not the best teacher ever, but certainly not a bad pick.  The tests are easy to lose points on, though.  Make sure to check your + / - signs (they love those signs)","He's alright.. But what I do wanna say something about the class. This is a HORRIBLY designed course. It's way too ridiculous for a gened and, believe or not, most teaching is done through smartphysics. Let's just be honest, how many people can actually sit down and learn stuff from youtube videos?","E&amp;M is a difficult topic but the system they use to teach it is great. I don't think it matters whether you get Beck or Gladding because its the system that matters. I didn't pay close attention in lecture but Beck didn't seem to explain things very well sometimes, and you could learn it all in the HW anyways.",Pretty good lecturer. Class is hard in general but he helped.,He is an okay prof.. the class is generally hard though.. and he does not really help make difficult concepts easy. the course would have been a lot better if it was curved though..,"He is a smart professor and I found his lectures very helpful.  Do not take this course lightly, it will be difficult, but Beck's lectures help.","Definitely knew his stuff but made this very abstract topic extremely boring and difficult.  Very friendly, very approachable, but is not great at explaining concepts."

The entire class loved the course; she provided a great selection of texts and facilitated lively class discussion. Her Spanish is impeccable, too. I highly recommend this professor and her courses.","This class is great because it's not just literature; she makes sure to incorporate history, circumstance, and other aspects to help you understand where a text or author is coming from. You are required to attend, but it is impossible to figure somethings out if you do not. As long as you make an effort, she will work with you.","Good teacher, definitely intelligent and passionate about what she's teaching. Down to earth but there aren't a lot of grades and attendance/participation is a big part of the grade.","okay class, but not my favorite.  books are boring, and not much time is given to read them. she isn't the greatest on sending out essay prompts on time.",Good teacher.  She really knows what she is talking about and really cares about it.  You have to go to class and contribute once in a while.  Just do that and she will be happy.,"I enjoyed her class. She expects thoughtful contributions to the lecture, and is very reasonable. I didn't think the coursework was too demanding, but it was definitely interesting and stimulating. Professional and nice.","Very good teacher.  She really knew what she was talking about and was very helpful and nice.  Not many grades though, and you have to go to class.  Definitely recommended.","She's a great teacher. Pretty demanding. There is a lot of reading in the class and you have to come because she gives a lot of pop quizzes.

There were some interesting in class activities.  Overall, the material seems like common sense, but then the tests end up being surprisingly hard.  There is a very large amount of reading for the class (a lot of which can be skimmed).  Class participation is a must.","He keeps the class very interesting with discussion and activities. He tries to pick interesting readings that make it easy to get involved. You must come to class and participate, but he makes it a very easy environment to do so. Bednar keeps class interesting and easy to listen to. Overall, a great class!","This class is fairly easy and interesting as long as you go to class and participate. Bednar is engaging and good at leading class discussion, but he does require you to participate in class to get a good grade. He makes this very unintimidating and tries to assign interesting and easy-to-read readings so it will be easy to participate.","Not a bad class. You MUST go to class and talk a lot because 20% of the grade is based on participation. You must saying 1-2 things every class if you have any hope to get an A. 1 midterm and final, he allowed you to use a cheat sheet which is helpful. Project has no guidance, but he grades them pretty easily. 5 1-page reflection essays. Must read."

Humble, expects class to call him out if he gets something wrong. I recommend trying to do research work with him as well (if you can).","It is important to take notes during lectures so you will understand the slides later. definitely use the text book to go over any thing you do not understand, because most of the lecture material can be found in the text book.  It is not an easy A but if you put in the effort an A is definitely possible",The lectures are difficult to follow but he is one of the most helpful professors outside of the classroom that I've ever had.,He thinks he's talking to fellow geneticists.

Genuinely enjoys the material he teaches and was actually able to get me to pay attention in lecture. I also love that he swears...a lot.,"I took this class Spring '12 &amp; he is definitely one of the best teachers in JOUR. Not only does he have experience, he offers advice &amp; allows you to share your opinions &amp; values in class. He is SMOOTH as well lol. Do the work, go to class &amp; get an A. I would def take another class with him.",Hands down one of the best Professors I've had at this university. He genuinely wants students to take something away from the class: he isn't so much concerned about grades. What I learned in Hate Crimes changed my life. Very open-minded and does his best not to interject his own opinions. He wants you to think for yourself. He's also hilarious!,"Really easy . Attend the class, participate &amp; do EXACTLY as he says &amp; you should get an A easy.","One of the smartest, well-versed  professors I've had at U of I. He really knows the class material and wants students to apply it outside of the classroom. He's there to educate  students, not lecture to them, and he encourages the class to think for themselves. He's also very funny. You will definitely look forward to going to class!","Literally the BEST teacher I have ever had.  He really cares about his students and is actually really funny.  He does an incredible job talking about such a heavy topic, all while making it funny and relatable.  If you ever need any sort of upper level credit, this is the class to take.  He's amazing!!!",best teacher ive ever had at u of i! take any class with him that you can!!!!!!!!!!,"FAVORITE PROFESSOR!! Absolute great guy. I have a little girl crush on him. Any professor that can use ""**** slap"" effectively in class is awesome. Hate Crimes was a very interesting class and you'll never be bored. I didn't read the textbooks or readings but still did well. As long as you listen to him, you're good. I want to marry him. No joke.","This guy is awesome!!! He's hilarious in class and knows what he's talking about. Although he does lecture from the books, you don't technically need them. I got an A without ever opening mine. Glad I had a chance to have him as a professor.","Chris Benson was by far my FAVORITE TEACHER AT UofI!!! I had him for his Hate Crimes Class, which you would think would be a very heavy topic. And although it was a many times, Prof. Benson keeps you intrigued (Not to mention, he's pretty hot for an older man lol). He's funny and super intelligent. You can tell he's passionate about the topic.","Completely loved him. He was very charming, sweet, and completely worthy of a hot pepper! (in that older man  kind of way) ;) His class was a joy to go to. He taught me everything I ever wanted to know about freelance magazine writing. You should take one of his classes if you can. It was easy but you still learned a lot. The way a class should be.","This class was AMAZING!  He was such a captivating speaker, and really did a great job of involving everyone in the conversation.  He really did want to hear everyone's opinions about whatever we were talking about that day, and he just did a great job of helping us to understand the material.","Best journalism professor by far!!!! He's hilarious and entertaining, very helpful and really cares about how his students are doing in his class. I would take him again if he taught anything else other than Magazine Writing. DEFINITELY take him if you can!!!! :)","Best journalism professor by far!!!! He's hilarious and entertaining, very helpful and really cares about how his students are doing in his class.

2439008,5.0,Erin,Benson,2,0.5888779431344099,Nice professor and kind. Lots of extra credits to make up your quizzes. Interesting screening.,"This class is a really solid introduction to archaeology or anthropology overall. There are a lot of quizzes and readings, but if you don't read you don't lose points. The class isn't overly difficult, but you still definitely need to study for exams. The lectures are really interesting and the professor is pretty approachable. Overall a good class"
216300,2.0,Joseph,Bentsman,18,0.3682120051913421,Easy grader but ridiculous work load,"Your best way to learn in this class is through the TAs. His lectures are long, boring, and don't provide any clarity on the subject matter. The homework assignments and exams are directly from the book and the material hardly ever changes. He's not helpful, but it's easy to pass due to his low grading scale.","This professor made me hate controls, which is actually a very important subject to understand. If you want to actually learn the material, teach yourself since he won't. You don't have to understand 90% of the material but you can still get a good grade since for tests and HW you just copy the provided example solutions with different numbers.","Never met a man more out of touch with what's going on in his classroom.  From day 1, everyone is lost and never quite figures it out, and in the meantime he keeps rambling on about something while giving out assignments that take 10-20 hours to complete.  Grades fairly easily-if he didn't, there's no hope to pass. Take this class with someone else","He isn't a bad professor, but the class is mainly self taught. Exams are easier than the other sections but expect a lot more homework. More work  Better grade tradeoff.","He's a nice guy, just out of touch and difficult to approach. Homeworks and exams are extremely long and boring, but straightforward-- you basically copy down the book examples using different numbers. Generous curve. Lecture is totally pointless-- he basically repeats the book verbatim.","Impressively worthless teaching strategy.  I have never worked so hard in a course but learned so very little.  Lectures are no more than rambling babbling of unorganized thoughts with no examples. This is essentially a self-taught course. Bentsman is entertaining at times and seems friendly, but incredibly arrogant and disconnected from students","As I am writing this it 1:48 AM.  We've been working on it for days and if we don't finish, he'll make us drop the course. DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR!!","This professor assigns at least 3x the work of the other section.  He adds material as he pleases and asks misleading, open ended, exam questions.  Avoid at all costs.",Best Professor on this campus!!,"I don't agree previous reviews except for that he really is a funny guy. Easy class since he gives examples for every homework which are pretty much the HW solutions, same for exams. He's a very nice guy. People dislike this class because it takes good effort to understand the material. But getting a good grade is easy even if you don't.","Not good, test wasn't too bad but he never introduces what he is about to talk about. The topics covered and material for tests are very hard to study for and he always talks about applications that are so far beyond every person in the class that they are pointless.  If another teacher is available pick them.",Horrific! the worst professor ever at the University of Illinois. Can't unsterstad squat from his lectures. His handouts are random. His exams are very difficult and follow a random distribution. I like when he cracks a joke only he understands. Very disorganized. He needs to focus on research and get away from teaching.,his tests are hard as hell.  but he's a hilarious professor; imagine a potato-shaped guy with a russian accent wearing elton-john rose-colored sunglasses talking about how he made missles back in the day.  if this guy did stand-up i would pay to see  him.,No Comments,Bentsman's class is very frustrating.  I recieved an A-but learned very little.  He is very disconected from his students.,No Comments,No Comments
2466095,1.0,Joseph,Bentsman,1,0.4642317319099447,Professor Bentsman is highly unreasonable in his expectations of students. Students should expect to devote 10-20 hours per week to his assignments and projects. Lectures are very difficult to follow and the book doesn't help much. There are much clearer lecturers on campus.

She is passionate about what she teaches and always has good intentions. She just wants her students to grow as a result of taking the class, because its such an under-represented and misunderstood topic.","So intensive class with tough graders and many things to do. Unless you write scientific, and complete answers, you will miss points in many ways and cannot get A+.",Easiest class ever. Just do the weekly homework to receive an A.,"Easy class. No attendance, although I attended every class because I was interested in the topic and often times there were guest speakers that were really interesting! There's no tests, just weekly online assignments and a couple projects here and there. The final is also a project. This class is awesome.","Probably one of the easiest class on campus, there are no attendance, no exams, and only meets once a week. All you have to do for the class is online weekly assignments, and three paper assignment and one final project. It is very easy, as long as you do the work that is required, and you will definitely receive an A for the class","Easy A, take it with Bentz.","Don't take SPED117 with any other professor. She is a super easy grader. There are ""pop"" quizzes, but she hints at when she'll give them. You don't need to read the book unless she tells you that it'll be covered on a pop quiz. Final project is easy.","i HATED this class. it was super easy, but it was so boring and such a waste of my time!",She really doesnt even teach the class the class is based on guest speakers basically and it makes it pretty iteresting. The only thing is that it is so long and time seems to go by really slow in the class. There is a weekly assignment no exams just 3 papers basically and a final project.,She is awesome.. EASY and nice teacher... Very passionate in what she is doing.. Easy A,"This is one of those classes that you can sign up for and then forget about. You never do anything in class. No tests, quizzes, final...anything! There is one project that you need to do and three out of class assignments but you really never need to go to class. She is also always commenting about the weather. Just a fun fact.","Prof. Bentz is soo nice and really accomodating. It took me almost the entire semester to figure out you don't have to go to class. Only a few grades, and I feel like she just tells the TAs to give everyone an A. Very easy, no exams. Take this class!",Easiest class ever. And we still learned something!
1903925,2.0,Liza,Berdchevsky,1,0.4162744695019632,"Worst professor I have had within UIUC's RST department.  She is hard to understand and the material is very complex at times.

1840012,1.4,Yelyzaveta,Berdychevsky-Kustanovich,4,0.2596854741469644,Very hard to understand basic concepts which she doesn't explain well. Tests and quizzes are very specific details which are impossible to remember for cumulative final.,The worst class I have taken in 3 years while at U of I.  Each class there is a quiz or a group exercise which she grades very tough and the only grades in the class except for a cumulative final.  She is very poor at explaining simple concepts and I would rather watch paint dry than try and listen to one of her lectures. Do not take this.,Horrible did not explain things well at all. If for a gen-ed I would not recommend it. Especially because there is only two exams and it is confusing how she teaches so thumbs down.,Doesn't explain things very well
396566,4.8,May,Berenbaum,19,0.6866055848286992,One of the best professors on this campus. She's so kind and truly wants all her students to succeed. She cares more about if you learned the material rather than weeding you out of the major. She is just a really passionate professor.,"Took it because it was said to be an easy A, and it was. But it was one of the classes you just start to dread because the material is such a waste of time. Bits and pieces of the lectures were entertaining, but mostly boring. Tests were just 100 random, pointless facts (straight from previous years' tests). Undoubtedly brilliant woman though.",Professor Berenbaum is such a caring and fun professor. She made a pretty boring topic interesting with bringing food a lot and fun labs. The class itself is pretty easy as long as you show up to class and look at the past exams that are on commass,"This class is so easy, but make sure you attend lecture because a huge amount of the grade weight is the in-class worksheets. They're not even graded for accuracy, which is nice. The exams are not hard but extremely trivial (100 random insect facts in multiple choice form) so they feel pretty silly. Berenbaum is kind but her lecture is pretty dry.",She's absolutely amazing!!,"Excellent, clear lectures. Informal tone but quite informative.","After seeing Professor Berenbaum give a lecture for LAS 101, she is fondly referred to as the ""Bee Lady"" in my circle of friends.  Knowing I needed to fulfill a LS credit, I wanted to have her as a professor. BEST DECISION. She was hilarious, gave out prizes for attending lecture, and presented insects in an interesting fashion. New appreciation.",Best prof on campus! She is so fun and loves her subject. She is very knowledgable and makes the topics interesting. Exams are very easy but you actually learn. This is the only class where I felt bad if I missed because she was such a great/nice person! Definitely take this class!,"This was a discovery course last semester (spring 2010) and was absolutely amazing! This was by far the most fun class that I have taken. you go on field trips, eat food every class period, and have no exams or homework. Plus, Prof knows what she is talking about and tries to make class interesting! def. recommend!","May is one of those professors that knows what she is talking about. If you have ANY question about insects she would probably be the person that would give you the most detailed and accurate answers. If you search information about insects, you are bound to stumble on articles citing her name!","She is an entomological encyclopedia! Very enthusiastic professor that will offer a lot of extra credit points for students that attend her lectures! :) and also draws for prizes etc. Take the lab, help your grade and they are actually FUN.","Awesome professor. Very successful, but down to earth.  Role model of many students",Dr. Bezembaum is fantastic!  What a great class!,"best.  class.  ever.  may berenbaum = entomological god(dess).  ... plus ib 109 is SO easy, surprisingly interesting, and actually really fun.  oh, and if you have room in your schedule, definitely opt for the lab portion.  it's kind of a joke.. but.... come on, honey tasting day?  edible insect day??  you don't want to miss that.","This class was fantastic!  The professor really wants you to succeed and does everything she can to help you get good grades.  The lectures were fun, and she brought in lots of visual aids.  It's nice to see a professor who cares about her students and understands that her class is not the only one they have!","Class was very fun and interesting, plus Bridget(TA) is funny and sexy.","Awesome class! Definitely one of my favorites this year, easy A for me.","If you can take this class, you should.  Professor Berenbaum is an awesome teacher.  Entomology 105 was one of my favorite classes this semester.","Awesome class (insects and people).  Take the lab, its easy and helps your grade.  I thought it was really interesting."
1286373,2.5,Howard,Berenbaum,3,0.33540873895957857,"A very fair professor - the topic is difficult but he doesn't ""surprise"" you on tests. He is an intense person but knows the topic well and will do whatever he can to help you pass - emphasizes he will meet with you during office hours or outside to help you understand the material.  He seems intimidating but is very kind when you talk to him.","Berenbaum immediately tells you that his tests are hard and he is not kidding. Does not communicate with TA, super ambiguous content and lectures. Take another lab class if possible....",Prof. Berenbaum's lectures are rambling and he rarely sticks to the syllabus. He does not communicate with his TAs and his grading process is not uniform. The examples he gives in class are from his own research 90% of the time and are rarely connected to the material at hand. He's also condescending and incredibly frustrating.

Does not hold up to the quality expected.","He is very knowledgable and passionate about his subjects. Also very funny; a stand-up comedian. That being said, his teaching style is really disorganized. He tends to ramble and often goes out on tangents. I agree with the last reviewer; he is a really harsh grader. Isn't specific about what he wants in his assignments, then rips them apart.","I do not recommend Mr. Berger.  His lectures were disorganized; he rambled on and on.

Highly recommended for anyone into studying media and actually learning things.","This is actually a pretty easy class and for all those business majors it fulfills your advanced comp.

Afterwards, we had to do two projects simultaneously and with a two weeks time period-which were all due on the same day.","Professor Bergonzi is an amazing conductor, very humorous and patient but expects his orchestra to perform at the highest level possible. I loved being in his orchestra. So much energy and positivity in rehearsal!","The class unfortunately did not focus much time on conducting from a gesture standpoint. He has very specific ideas of what he wants students to turn in for their assignments, but he provides detailed descriptions and rubrics for almost everything. Those that complain about not understanding him are those that did not take the time to read them.",Self-centered and self-aggrandizing,He knows a great deal about music and you'll learn tons if you pay attention.,"Orchestra under Dr. Bergonzi was probably one of the best orchestral experiences I have ever had.  He puts himself into the music and works very hard at getting a good string sound.  Plus, he doesn't try to run it like a machine.

Gets more hate than he deserves.,Had him for math 415. It was a giant class so it's hard to say how he is in a more intimate setting. The class was extremely easy and he generally kept to the point.,"Marteen is pretty nice. I feel like I learned a lot more in his class than in P. Hieronomy. Word of advice: do all the practice exams and do them well. If you know the material on practice exams and howto handle the 'short' problems, you'll be golden.","He is a great professor when you actually go to lecture, but the material is not overly difficult and can easily be learned without going to lecture. Exams are conceptual multiple choice questions, and free response questions like those shown in lectures, but with different numbers. Overall, if you can teach yourself the material, you'll do well.","Super easy class. Went to class at most 5 times, got an A+, easy quizzes in discussion. Easy exams. Slides were very helpful and informative.","Linear Algebra really isn't that hard, but his lectures made it seem that way. He would throw around a bunch of terms and use symbols without explaining their meanings. He'd basically just write a bunch of stuff on the board and say ""this is this"" without explaining.","I took math 415 with him, he is not a good professor. It was like studying by myself, quizzes were super easy but the exams were really hard. Avoid his classes.","The class was pretty easy, but ohmygosh the lectures are boring! Also the easy material is dragged way out at the beginning and the really tough stuff is kinda glossed over, which was frustrating.",This is the best professor I've ever had!

He also changes the dates of handouts,"Not my favorite professor at uiuc. He gave pretty clear explanations, but didn't seem like he really cared that much about the class, which made it hard to care myself. Anyway, this course is the perfect course to take with mathematica, so do that one if you can. Otherwise, do it online, or just learn it and proficiency out.",Handwriting is hard to read. Lectures are not helpful. Studying by myself is OK for this course. Always changing the date for handing in the written homework.,"The assignments are super easy, and the lecture materials are not too bad since you can just look it up in the book if you miss the lecture, but the exams tend to be more conceptual and harder than the assignments/lectures.. although i do like the curves he gave us :]","Best professor ever! He said he was not curving our scores, but when our average score was low he always gave us a curve. Eventually he ended up curving two out of three of the mid-term exams. He also gave us many extra credits. He really wanted to help his students to get A's! His TA's were pretty great too!","Though he's not the best professor, he wrote his tests mostly based on worksheets and reviews. Just don't get yourself behind and do your homeworks and worksheets, then you will be fine. Plus, he throws some extra-credit chances, which rarely happens to most math classes.","These comments are pretty harsh. It's true, this was a difficult class and he may not have been very helpful, but he's a pretty cool guy, always seems laid back. Just not the best teacher.",The worst teacher I have ever had. Teaches you the most basic things and expects you to know  advanced topics not discussed in class. He has no interests in the class's success not caring when half of the class failed an exam.

I also loved how he would supplement class discussion with funny stories!","This class was difficult, not for the workload but for the content itself.

He would always start the class with review exercises and wouldnt mind repeating something if it wasnt clear. Great instructor!",It is very clear by his teaching style that Ander loves what he does.

The material was moderately hard, but he makes you really understand it by challenging you on the tests/homework.","Assigned homework was EXTREMELY hard to do; I went to tutoring office hours a LOT.

However, he seems like a nice guy.  His homework problems were a lot more tedious and difficult than anything you will see on an exam.  If you have a good discussion TA that's where you'll do the majority of your learning.","As a math 242 professor, Berndt was sifficult for me to manage. In particular, we did not fully finish the material for exam 2, and Berndt dealt with that by putting problems that we had not done in any of the homeworks. Seems to be a nice guy, but as a teacher for calc II, please be warned if you are an average level math student like me.","Berndt is a great guy... basically if the Coen brothers had wanted an analytic number theorist in ""Fargo"" for some reason, it would have been him: voice, mannerisms, appearance, everything.

Mandatory attendance!",This Introduction to Hinduism class seemed far from an introductory course. She expected us to all have a pretty solid foundation of knowledge in the religion. Many of the students in my class did have a solid foundation and she seemed to enjoy them more. Would not take again. Hard A and tests incredibly lengthy and detailed. GL,"Boring lectures. Reads off slides. Make sure you understand the material by closely reading the books. Do not depend on the lectures and TA sections. Weekly quizzes, and they are not the easiest. Tests are difficult, long, and require a lot of analysis; no practice exams. On a scale of 1-10, the amount of effort you have to put in for an A is 8.","Amazing professor, very knowledgeable about her field. Very helpful with me when I couldn't make deadlines and the topic was very interesting! If you are interested in women in Hinduism this is the professor for you!","This class was supposed to be an easy A before she replaced the previous teacher. She tries too hard to be cultural, and poorly reads off powerpoints. Exams were a lot of writing. Study hard, and an A is doable."

The class was on the second half of French and Comparative Cinema, and the list of films was incredibly curated. I enjoyed almost every film screened in class, and the PPT presentation she gave following the film gave new insight. The assignments were manageable and interesting. Great Prof!","I loved this class. Professor Blake's discussions were provocative and I had an amazing experience with her. She is vague about grading and projects, but I found her enjoyable. Her style of teaching isn't for everyone, but if you have any interest in the subject matter, her classes are great.","Nancy Blake is the worst professor at the University of Illinois. She studied under eminent theorist Jacques Lacan and obviously learned nothing. She quoted wikipedia and Sparknotes gratuitously and spoke in a slow, inoculating tone. She is awful and hope that you never have to take a class with her. Grading is completely based on your TA.","I think the others explain her perfectly! Her class wasn't too bad except she was very vague about the exam content. She flat out said to just study EVERYTHING for the exams with no study guide or anything, although paying attention to recurring themes in lecture hint at the exam contents. I didn't like that she was so vague in that way.","This woman is boring as hell...  The lectures have so much discussion of the history and so little discussion about important aspects of the works we read.  She mentions something in lecture one time and it appears on the final.  Her outfits are ridiculous and her French attempts are annoying.  Lastly, her she seems to read something like wikipedia",Nancy is kind of crazy.  She has interesting clothes though...it's kind of an incentive to come to class to see her new outfits.  She tends to stray off the subject of the readings and talk a lot about unrelated artwork...so make sure you read!,not very smart?,Pop quizzes during lecture make attendance a must.

I also found that in any design class that there are many shades of grey, but in this class only black and white answers, her way and the wrong way.","Someone said that Dr Blake knows databases, and she brings that experience to class adding to the text book information that will help get a job. Like other tech classes answers are often black and white, so grading is hard and we need to start assignments with enough time to find out answers. This is harder than other LIS classes, but rewarding.",Professor Blake is extremely knowledgeable about databases but her teaching is sub par. Lectures are disorganized and often full of errors. The learning process in the class is a guessing game rather than a learning experience. Collaboration with classmates is strongly discouraged. Advice and suggestions from Dr. Blake are annoyingly opaque.,Dr. Blake does not tolerate mistakes by students. But her own work is often rife with errors.

He tries to teach the best he can but I think many miss out on what he is trying to say, perhaps it is his accent. He goes pretty fast in class;  last 3 minutes, he might cover Stokes Thm. and just touch it lightly in the next lecture which usually is a problem. Go for his office hours if you can - he wants to help.","Boca tends to take the more 'big picture' approach to teaching.  Where other prfessors might do example problems, Boca likes to examine where mathematical conclusions come from.  If you do a little more leg work, you can fully appreciate it.

You don't learn anything in lecture. There is a ridiculous amount of material and what you are tested on is really not what you learn. She is a terrible lecturer. I would avoid by all means.,"You don't learn anything in lecture except the fill in the blank answers. The review guides are at least twice as long as the tests and basically cover everything in the notes so they don't narrow down anything. In addition, even if you feel you know the review guide you could still do very poorly on the tests. Overall, easy minus class minus tests"

His grading methods were bizarre and difficult and he would never or very rarely provide a rubric for anything we did, so we had little guidance for what he did require. The was rarely available, admitted to not checking his email, and was late in grading everything I turned in.","This professor was the worst I have ever had. The man appeared late to class every day but expected mandatory attendance, he had NO online portal for the class, rarely answered e-mails, rarely appeared at office hours, spoke in monotone, and would randomly speak French mid sentence. He also gave us a 15-20 pg research paper for a 200 level class.","Tested material he hadn't taught or assigned. Lectures useless. Assigned all students to give presentations two days before semester end; tried to make us attend class on Reading Day to listen to them all. He had major health problems during this semester, so I understand that he wasn't at his best, but I think it's time for him to stop teaching.","Most disorganized class ever. No advance notice on when homework is assigned, and always due the next class. Sometimes it gets graded, sometimes not. Prof usually 5-15min late. Got so far behind in the syllabus, he scheduled extra evening classes where he assigned homework due the next class session! Too bad if you worked... Easy grader though.","Prof Bokamba is the shizz, though it's hard to follow him when he starts to go on his ramblings. He is a sweet old man though and his deadlines for homework are incredibly flexible. He forget to take attendance often, but attending each class isn't necessary, nor is doing the readings entirely--he gives an outline for the midterm and final :D",No Comments,Professor Bokamba is the coolest!  He doesn't care too much about homework or test grades as longs as you show that you know what to do in class.  He is very good at getting everyone involved and really helps those who don't understand.  Nicest professor ever!!!

Thinks she is funny, but she is not.  Long, boring classes with mandatory attendance and must participate and suck up to get a decent grade.

Bol is a good teacher, however like everyone stated her grading doesn't make any sense. The midterm average was a 57%. You can never tell how you are doing until you get your final grade which is clearly too late","Undeniably, she is a nice professor. However, her grading system really killed me a lot. I did not realize that the participation was so vital until I got my final grade. She gave me the lowest grade in my academic history due to lack of participation.","She is one of the nicest professors you'll have, and you'll be entertained by her outfits alone. Just as a warning, the class is harder than it seems, so my gripe with her is that you don't realize you're doing worse than you thought you were until you see your final grades. Overall, though, she explains the material well.","One of my least favorite teachers in college so far.  Teaches a class on structuring organizations, but has no idea how to structure her own class. Relative performance grading crap used where you have no idea where you stand the entire system. Class material isn't that bad, and the teacher is a nice person, but her system is screwed up. Avoid her!","Course details are listed by the person below me. On a more personal side, Bol is a pretty good teacher and makes sure you understand topics well. For accy 304 it doesn't really matter what teacher you have b/c all of the courses have the same structure, but I would recommend Bol over any other professor - very pleasant class.","Grading is relative, so you never quite know what you're getting. 2 memos due per week, but 2/3 are pass/fail. No midterms (like all 304); just 5 short quizzes, a final, and a semester-long application project. Participation is vital."

I heard that this class was going to be hard but she is very clear in lecture.","Lectures were a bit of a snooze and tests/projects were graded a little unfairly, but overall, she's alright. Nice professor who can answer questions to the fullest. Someone else said, she invented this class, but it was a little to vague for my tastes. Much different than the other 300's. Not an easy A because everyone got killed on group projects","Did not go over time in her lectures. This class was very interesting, and she basically invented the course. The group projects are kind of a pain. Overall the course is not hard if you pay attention and be involved in the homeworks. A small part of your grade is 1-min speeches and presentations.

She basically constructed the EGE course by herself and made it interesting! She's very helpful and great to talk to!

I'm a girl and I had no problems with her.",She was not very clear,The class was easy except for that every single student had to stay after the bell for every exam.  Her lectures were so slow that we wouldn't even get through a single example in a lecture when it would only take 5 minutes to complete had she been competent.,"Never gives enough time for the exams, Only curves the bottom half of the class, so if you work your butt off you get no curve, but the failures do, her lectures are useless, I could keep going, but if you don't get the idea by now you never will.","Slow slowwer and slowwest is the best way to describe her lectures.  Her tests would take a normal student 75 minutes but she only allows 50 minutes.  With all that said, the class was a breeze even though she could not lecture.",The class is boring but required for all CEE majors.  Its like taking an elementary stats class but she makes it more complicated than it really needs to be.

He tried hard but didn't get through to the class most of the time. He was really harsh on the participation grades.","He is the TA for the discussion section on Media, Money, and Power.

He's pretty quiet but you have to realize that he does know what he's talking about and his class is fair (its bell curved).,"He is horrible professor, if you get into his class, GET OUT FAST!!!!. You will hate his class and spend massive amount of time working outside of class because you can?t understand one word he says. It?s more pleasant to put splinters under your finger nails then attend his lectures.",No comment,"Based on the hand waving argument, Roman was a phenomenologically unrefined professor.  I was very perturbed by his teaching style.  On a back of the envelope calculation, I would give this class one out of two jazz hands."

She used lecture outlines and basically talked right off of them. I did learn a lot but mostly from discussion. Be prepared to do a lot of work and gain little from it. She can also be hard to get a hold of if you need her.,"It was kind of a lot of work for a 200 level, but it was well worth it.  I learned so much, and I loved everything about the class.  Definitely talk to Professor Bowen outside of class, too; she's quite wonderful.  If it were possible for me to take all of my classes from her, I would.",Merle was an absolutely horrid prof.  Her lectures were boring and she may have been knowledgeable of her subject but never showed it.  I would never take another of her classes.  She took a perfectly interesting class and made it awful.,Wonderful class. Extreemly interesting and engaging. Her lectures were early in the morning but i couldnt fall asleep during them because they were so good! kind of a lot of work but well worth it. Shes a great teacher,"Pan Africanism:  Loved her course!  Bowen is very articulate and you can tell she knows her stuff. Tests are multiple choice and true/false, a little difficult.  Have a lot of outside work.  Have to see 3 movies at the library, and write a report on them. Have to do weekly abstracts of the past week's material.  But all worth while."
1317192,2.0,Jon,Bowermaster,1,0.45324373778826926,The three hour lecture is pretty brutal as he rambles on for two hours and then you have small group discussions for another hour. Study the vocab in the book to do well on the exams. Spend time reviewing for the exam because you'll probably not remain attentive in class. The field project is simple and he grades easily. Not bad for 4 credit hours.

The work itself is difficult and you have to come to class, but if you do that you're pretty much guaranteed a good grade. I never did the outside reading but participated and still got A+. Don't be afraid to ask for help, especially on the final project. He just wants to see that you're trying to learn.","Must discuss! This class is labeled Future Politics, and it is sci fi readings and then application to potential politics in the near (and far) future. One of the best classes I have EVER taken.",Prof Bowers is a really nice guy and sort of facilitates class discussion rather than lecture which is cool. Reading the books was only a jumping off point for discussions that became really interesting. Not the greatest class for shy people. Grade is based off participation and two papers based off your own ideas.Recommend for scifi/polisci lovers,Future Politics. Jake Bowers is the sweetest professor. He runs his class so that you'll get out what you put in. Be prepared to participate in class discussions. He values opinions and independent ideas. HIGHLY recommended for mature students who will do the work and not slack off. The work load isn't that bad. Jake has an awesome laugh.,"JAKE IS THE SWEETEST GUY EVER (YES, HE HAS A PHD AND WE CALL HIM JAKE). DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS IF YOU HAVENT TAKEN STATS. NO TEST. NO QUIZZES. FINAL 2-5 PAGE PAPER. DONT BUY THE BOOK.","Definitely a great teacher, and a very easy A if you just attend classes: in-class work is 50%, and it is very easy to do well on this. There are no tests, and he gives you a lot of leniency on the final paper. I would definitely recommend this class","Fantastic professor. The class was a one-off seminar on future politics, and Bowers was great at explaining everything. Very hands-off professor; acts more as a mediator and facilitator for discussions rather than a lecturer. Very fair grader; he explained exactly why you got the grade you did on the papers. Highly recommended.","Absolutely terrible teacher, its nice that this class doesn't have tests cause the class would be screwed. Gives us work to do that he doesn't even teach us and the TA doesn't know how to do, i would never have taken this class if i knew this guy was the worst teacher ever","Made statistics really interesting but almost totally incomprehensible.

Bowles is a very nice, approachable professor. Here is a little advice to get an A in her class: go to lecture (even though it is optional) because she offers extra credit several times during the semester. Complete the practice exams at least a day before the exam because they are structured like the exams. The exams are very easy! Go to disc","I had Melissa for both Span 204 and Span 471. In both classes, she was extremely approachable, always prepared for class, and overall a really genuinely nice lady. I got solid grades in both of her classes. She takes you step by step through the content, and presents it in an easy-to-learn way. Always wiling to make changes, also.","I think that most people found this class to be easy, but I had a lot of difficulty with it because I think that I just wasn't taught Spanish very well in high school.

I have no clue how I tested into this level Spanish, but I managed to get an A- with extra credit.",The class itself was easy. Her lectures were extremely boring...I sat there and texted the whole time and got an A. I liked how she surveyed us halfway through the semester to see how she could improve.,"I'm surprised about all the nice comments about her.  Yes, the class was a breeze, but I hated her teaching.  The TA's always had to clarify for her.  Class wasn't mandatory but there were extra credit iclicker points that helped in the end. Discussion is mandatory but not hard at all. Grading for orals and writing assignments were fair and lenient",Really easy. I forgot to do almost half of the compass quizzes and still got an A. Basically a review of high school Spanish.,"Structure, teaching, grading and content were all crystal clear. She seems really enthusiastic about teaching, and genuinely concerned about whether her students are understanding the material. The class was enjoyable, no regrets at all about taking it and am taking a class with her again this semester.","This class was super easy, walked away with an A+. Lecture is optional and i seldom went. Everything is in discussion, my t.a. was great! The novel was pretty good and the homework was not bad at all! Exams were easy if you take practice test.","This class is super easy and lecture is optional. I am a Spanish major, literally went to half the lectures, and got an A on each exam. The exams are easy and the Practice Exams are literally the same thing, just different questions. Same format.. I think she did a good job teaching, the lecture was boring, &amp; the novel was never really incorporated","Excellent professor. Sometimes you may feel falling asleep because of her lectures and her voice, but she's great.","lecture is optional.  online quizzes.  two written ""papers"" in spanish (150 words)first and second drafts for grade.  3 tests.  one graded spoken situation.  not too difficult.","Lecture is optional.

The website he uses has simplified problems that aren't representative of the test material.,Dude was nice but a horrible teacher. Read off a paper and didn't make sense. Hard class without any previous linear algebra experience. MAKE SURE HE GRADES YOUR EXAMS CORRECTLY. I'm still concerned he gave me an incorrect grade for the final exam. stain,He's really a good instructor and I don't get why he's rated so poorly on this website. Maybe he's too slow when talking but the main point is that he really elaborates everything explicitly! Love him!,the way he would explain things just never clicked,"Makes mistakes on examples a lot, and is not the most clear while explaining but he is a good guy and tries to help.  When the board has hard to read he bought a special eraser and chalk so it was more visible and he always asks if there are any questions.",He was often a couple minutes late to lecture and frequently made mistakes while doing examples. After a couple lectures more than half of the students stopped going to lecture. I kept going to watch him bomb twice a week in the hopes that we would offer those who tried hints on the exam. He did not. I'm really upset that I chose him for this class,"Your grade depends on the class average so he doesn't really use the usual grading scale.

Much of the math/calculation stuff you need to teach yourself and TA's grade the quizzes a tad hard but Braun makes the material easy to understand. Honestly with minimal student effort.","Professor Braun's class is okay. He does a great job exposing his students to what materials science actually is. He has pretty cool demos and welcomes questions anytime. However, the TAs were a little harsh grading the homework and the quizzes, making the class pretty frustrating sometimes.","Braun was a great professor and definitely knew the material.  Sometimes, he expected students to have a slightly unrealistic amount of previous knowledge, but was very willing to clarify if questions were asked.  TAs did all grading and were pretty harsh.  Students were expected to read continuously, but often didn't.","Professor Braun is just so absolutely intelligent. I mean, that's how I felt. I don't see how i wouldn't if he seemed to have an answer to EVERY question thrown at him. The demo's werent amazing,but the atmosphere (aside from being 90 degrees) was still great. He really understood the meaning of the class.","Best possible professor for an intro level class. Concepts covered in lecture aren't too complicated and, if they are, Braun knows how to explain them in an uber clear way. He's really approachable too, so definitely ask questions if you have any. Only advice is to be careful on the homework, as Braun and his TAs tend to grade it rather harshly.","P Braun is amazing!  He's one of the best lecturers I've met so far!

Again, Mister Tim was super nice, but the TA was unhelpful for MATLAB.",Required to learn MATLAB for a 1 credit hour class. Fun otherwise.,"Bretl's lectures were helpful because they enhanced both algorithmic and intuitive thinking skills.  I feel like students are upset that the average grade in the class is a C, so they blame Bretl for it, and complain about the lack of a curve, when, in fact, a C average is a perfect curve.  Also, MATLAB is extremely beneficial to this course IMO.","good guy, class is really hard, uses a lot of differential equations and MATLAB that not everyone has learned, making class and homework difficult",No Comments

He always tries to inject humor into his lectures, which does keep you engaged with what's happening in the class. If you don't find his lectures  very clear, visit him after class or during office hours with doubts. He may seem a little uninterested, but he does care about his students","I enjoyed Bronski as a person,  but not as a professor. In lecture, he sped through material and covered only the easiest and hardest example problems, but nothing we would see on homework or an exam. I ended up learning most of the material on my own from a guy on YouTube. Also, don't take 231E if you only took Calc 1 in high school.",Great lecturer. Class is tough but nothing I didn't expect going in. Definitely one of the better Calc professors on campus.,Bronski is always there to help you.

The engineering section really isn't needed, take normal if possible. The final was unexpectedly hard compared to the midterms. He is a pretty dry instructor, but he is clear in his lectures.

I also had her for my discussion (most people have TAs) so going to discussion was interesting too. She is very lenient when it comes to turning things in late, but the TAs are a little more strict. This is definitely an easy A class.","Jan is energetic and passionate.  This class is EASY.  Connect assignments are tedious, but you can do them over and over again until you get them right.  Go to mandatory discussions, and go to optional review sessions.  If you do go to lectures, find the exam study guides ahead of time on compass and fill them out in class.  Easiest A ever.",Great professor. She is very nice and extremely knowledgeable and willing to give advice and insight. Easy class; pay attention and you will get an A.,"She reads right off the power points and adds a little bit of relevant insight while doing so.

Dr. Brown is incredibly fair, his lectures are thorough and he has reasonable expectations of his students (i.e. doesn't make you memorize minute details). Not hard to get an A if you study. Time consuming? yes. Hard? no.","First off, if you're going to take this class as an elective (which is what I did), think twice. It's A LOT of work. Getting an 'A' isn't difficult, but it will require you to spend hours answering trivial questions on a study guide and then memorizing tons of material- Usually around 25 written pages. My advice? Find a friend and split the work.","Tests were fairly easy, two essays worth almost half the points and the rest multiple choice.  He grades on his own curve, which he sets the B/C line at the class average (for my class it was 82%).  Final was NOT cumulative.  Put in effort and it will be easy.  The MCB 104 Lab sucks."
1205710,4.6,Kristine,Brown,5,0.3523115556461948,She is very approachable and helpful. Definitely one of the better and more dedicated profs in the Econ dept. Exams are slightly long but doable as long as you know the concepts well enough. Homework problems are helpful too in getting you to review and understand the materials.,"Need to go to class for lecture notes. Lectures notes, problem sets and review sheets are enough to do well in the exams. Exams are just longer versions of the problem sets.","Homeworks weren't too bad. She always taught you what you needed to know to do them.Tests were pretty much longer more complicated homeworks. Overall, good class, good teacher.","This is a difficult class. The tests are way too long. Good lecturer, but pretty boring","The homeworks were reasonable but didn't really teach much. She will prepare you for the midterm exams. All in all, I liked the class, and she was the one of the better lecturers I'd had in the econ dept so far."

I was excited to learn economics when I enrolled in the MBA program, but did not remember much from my undergraduate education. He balanced the essentials with the more focused material masterfully. This is one of the classes I will remember for years to come. PS he is brilliant",He is a really great professor and he has the ability to make the topic really interesting and easy to understand,Jeff obviously knows his stuff and is passionate about his work. He is able to take complex subjects and explain them (in a bipartisan manner)in a way that anyone can understand. He has an impressive background and has had several articles (and books)published. I still find myself referencing some of the concepts I learned in his class.,"I thoroughly enjoyed the knowledge and challenge that Professor Brown brings to the classroom, especially from his thorough experience as a true Economist. I came to B-School to learn from professors like him.","One of the most knowledgeable, humble and down-to-earth professors I have met. Class was taught and graded fairly. Really appreciated professors concern for the academic and professional growth of students.","Professor Brown has a great combination of work experience, academic excellence, and thought leadership. I've found that rare.  He draws his rich professional experience, including policy work &amp; board membership, into his courses. The result is interesting, engaging courses that encourage you to think strategically &amp; act pragmatically. Great prof!","Professor Brown did a fantastic job explaining complex topics. I took ECON courses during my undergrad and wish Brown was my professor back then. Not to mention, he was the Senior Economist for the White House  Council of Economic Advisers. Truly privileged to have taken his class.","The day this class was over I wanted to take it again to learn that much more. The professor was engaging, always approachable, and sincerely committed to each of us learning every week. More importantly, he made the material accessible, learnable, and genuinely interesting. This class will help shape my career. Thank you, Professor Brown!","Such a good professor that I took 2 of his classes. Jeff is great with office hours!  He was super patient with me as I asked the same questions week after week. And I have enough hand drawn graphs to make a ""Jeff Brown Coloring Book"".  It will be in stores before class begins next Fall.","Great instructor.  Explanations regarding retirement policy, history and current situation were excellent.  Learned much about social security and causes of current situation","Jeff's economics course changed my life. That might seem hyperbolic, (especially from an MBA student with an emphasis in marketing), but I assure you, it's true. UofI is known as a research university; Jeffs research and experience is impressive, but his ability to make econ interesting, accessible, and relevant makes him a truly great professor.","Prof. Brown has  an incredible amount of knowledge about economics.  He keeps his class engaged and makes the material easy to comprehend and he uses practical examples.  Everyone should jump at the opportunity to take on of Prof. Brown's classes, you will come away with a much better understanding of economics.",Excellent Professor!!!  Willing to help in office hours and after class.  Very good public speaking  and communication skills.  Teaches very useful information and tests fairly.  One of my favorite professors experienced as a MBA student.,"He thinks he is a great professor, but he really isn't that great.  He uses bad analogies and sometimes makes topics harder to understand."

To the point lectures, explains concepts clearly."
1700413,3.9,Sarah,Brown-Schmidt,9,0.4433413787076719,"Interesting class, although tricky if you don't have any background in cognitive psychology yet. No papers, and attendance isn't taken (although I'd recommend it). Expectation is to go to T.A. for help before meeting with the professor. Four multiple choice exams, and the lowest score gets dropped. Good preparation for more advanced psych classes.","Dr. Brown-Schmidt is an extremely knowledgeable and enthusiastic professor. Attendance isn't mandatory, but you'll want to be there for every lecture. Memorize every detail of every power point slide - there are a lot of tricky questions on exams. Quizzes are gimme points - they are online and allow you unlimited tries. Extra credit available.","I thought this class would be way harder than it was. The material is interesting, and the tests aren't bad as long as you go to review sessions and do the study guides. Would recommend attending because some in-class examples are on the exam and aren't clear in the lecture slides.","This class was great. The content was clear, what was expected of you was clear, and Dr. Brown-Schmidt had a wonderful attitude. As long as you know what's on the slides, you're golden for the exams. Crack open the book every once and awhile for the quizzes or clarification. Lectures were interesting and easy to listen to. Thumbs up!","How to get an A in this course: attend lecture, do study guides before review day, review lectures before exams.  Not necessary to take notes in lecture, but attendance is important as slides can be really confusing if you didn't hear her explain it.  Textbook not necessary, too much extraneous information and no exam questions taken from the text","I feel that many people give her a hard time.  The class material is interesting, and she explains concepts clearly and concisely.  All you need to do for exams is memorize slides.  If you go to class, this should be an easy A because she uses her in class examples on the exam.  With 200 people in the class, there is also a pretty generous curve.","This class is by no means easy. I study really hard for the exams, and I don't get A's on them. She goes very fast during lecture and it's hard to keep up. You definitely need to go to class because there are iclicker points. The class is really boring too, I don't recommend it.",Overall this class is fairly easy as long as you half pay attention/ do the readings before the test. There are iclicker points that make attendance mandatory. As a professor she is very dull and is not very informed about the information she is teaching. But still a fairly easy class.,Her class is just about keeping up with the reading and attending lecture. It requires a significant amount of time so make sure that you focus on the class.
345604,4.5,Gerald,Browne,3,0.5907267483822115,"Gerald M. Browne was a wonderful classics professor who taught in a traditional, old-fashioned read-the-text way that suited his personality perfectly.

The final is a little bit tougher than the exam but it is still easy to get a good grade on all the exams and homework assignments. He is a very good teacher and relates the material to everyday examples. He makes the class intresting even if you are not intrested in Economics,"The material is extremely vague.  No curve.  Tests are a lot like the past exams he gives out, go to discussion it helps.  Lecture notes is all the additional material given, if there was an actual book this class might be better.  I recommend going to Parkland/local community college to take any 100 level Econ course.",Brozovic comes off as a nice guy but this class is a joke.  The class notes are so vague that you dont learn anything w/ them.  I suggest skipping all of Brozovic's lectures because they are boring and a waste of time w/ no educational value. Just go 2 discussions and look at old test and that is all you need to pass this class with an A or B.,"Brozovic is an awesome professor! He's got a hilarious English accent is nice to everyone. He explains material thoroughly and makes ag econ a lot of fun. Every once in a while he will bring food in for you to eat. The TAs are also good for this class. If you need an econ credit go with ACE 100, but only in the spring when Brozovic teaches it.",One word to describe him: Phenomenal. He is so good at what he does and easy too. He know how to explain difficult concepts. The class isn't too bad and it counts as ECON 102. The college of ACES makes you feel cared for and important.  TOTALLY RECOMMEND it

Great class and prof though.","Amazing class, and always interesting. I took this during the summer, and the only downside was the class's tendency to run five to fifteen minutes long, due to a lack of bells, but during fall and spring it shouldn't be a problem.

Make sure you do over the homework before each test and you will get a B forsure if not an A.",Pretty tough class no matter who you have.  Grades are very fair.,"This dude is very disorganized and doesnt know how to teach. The concepts are not very hard, but he just cant explain them in a clear way. He's not that hard of a grader though. He has a poor attitude, If you go to office hours he acts like you are inconveniencing him.","Hard teacher. Only homework is problems in back of book, and you will never get an answer for those. He is disorganized and frenzied.

This was the class that I used most of my time studying and still struggled because I couldn't understand the relationship between visualization and political communication. I would recommend this class if you want to study about rhetoric.","Katie is really nice as a person, and if you put in a decent amount of effort, she's an easy grader too. This course has all essay exams that are easy because she gives you a study guide of exactly what is going to be asked on the exam beforehand so you can prepare. I would definitely recommend the course and Katie.",Katie is a great professor. I had her for CMN 340 and the class is really easily. You will only use the book for certain articles (if she hasn't uploaded any) to write written responses. The quizzes are easy. Just study the definitions and you will be fine. Exams aren't cumulative. Attendance is required after 3 excused absences. Great Course!

The class will be much easier if you take it with Phys 212. Overall, not a hard class if you know your stuff. Oh yea, and the RA project is rough, but just throw something together.",Decent lecturer. Great teacher. Helpful advisor. Not a bad choice.,"Best professor for ECE110, she is the only professor for 110 that teaches it exclusively, so she is more engaged than the other professors. She is very clear and explains all the concepts very well!","ECE 110 is NOT an easy class, you're probably taking it because you have to. You'll be saving yourself a lot of headache and frustration by getting Brunet, she's the best 110 lecturer out of the three. She makes the class exciting by getting students involved. Only problem is that she comes of a rude and negative when you ask her questions.",Awesome lecturer.,"ECE 110 is difficult in the sense that you have a lot of material to cover throughout the semester. Concepts are not that hard just the amount of work. Make sure you do the homework &amp; review it often. Brunet is a good professor and teaches well. Usually nice, sometimes rude. Can get angry/frustrated over small things which is a little intimidating","Hands down the best of the 110 professors. Lectures are full of examples. Good teacher, really nice","She has a french accent, which sounds a bit strange at the beginning of the year. Overall, she is a great lecturer and is very through in making sure everyone understands the material. Many of students that had her say that she is one of the best professors in ECE 110. Also, if you want her to know you, just go to class early and sit in the front.","she's helpful, but reacts weird sometime.  She just kind of looking straight at you not saying anything, kind of freak me out.  But she's nice, and concise about the topic.  ECE 110 is not that hard","This lady seems very nice at first, and she's not the worst at teaching because she kind of babies you.. but beware, the tests and the entire class are very difficult.  Brunet is very very rude and demotivating to students outside of the class",Very good professor. Easy to understand. Extremely helpful!,She's just awesome. :),Professor Brunet is a very engaging lecturer. She is very good at teaching and is even better one on one in office hours.,An accent that you actually want to listen to.,"Great lectures, and slide handouts are very helpful. Tests can be confusing though.","Very hard for a freshman class. Her lecture is pretty useful, but her then she tries to trick you up on her exams. It doesn't help that you have to interpret her version of English while taking the exam. Good lecture overall but way too much work and difficulty for a freshman level class.","She's ok, heard she's better than most of 110 lecturers, but has a tendency to greet only white students in class.",Brunet was pretty decent overall.  French accent took a few minutes to get used to but not a problem.  Lab sucked though; boring and kept me from getting an A.,Lectures were so rudimentary that I was too bored by them to come most of the time.    But that's inevitable in any introductory class.,"Brunet is a good prof overall.  A little difficult to decipher her french accent at first, but by the end of the course you'll find yourself loving it."
531660,3.8,Robert,Brunner,30,0.5299176923245537,"Pro: probably knowledgeable about his data field. ACCY department people said it's so hard to find a person like him. Choose Linden as TA if possible Cons: 1. Poor teaching skills: can't explain things effectively. Too much ""inspiring"" discussion in the lecture and you have to learn on your own at home 2. Bad attitude: mock at students often","Coming into this class I was scared of Dr. Brunner after reading some of these other reviews but he's honestly one of the nicest people I've had as a professor here. If you take the time to put effort into the class and learn, you'll be rewarded. Cool guy.","The most horrible I have ever seen. Tons of homework and harsh grading, plus this professor's bad attitude. NEVER EVER CHOOSE HIM.","My python programming skills improved dramatically thanks to Advanced Data Science (I never took the Foundations course), and I became better at coding in general, so for that reason this class was transformative to me. However, the conceptual treatment of topics was fairly superficial, so I walked away with the sense of not having learned a lot.","Professor Brunner is very knowledgable about data science. If you are relatively new to python, you will learn a lot from this class. The people complaining about the high grade cutoffs have to understand that without them, everyone would get an A in the class.",Don't pick him he is awful. He doesn't do anything and the cutoff is so high. I hate this professor so much.,I am taking INFO 490 (Advanced Data Science) I don't understand the professor logic in grading. The cutoff for an A is 96% and we have 20 minutes to complete the quiz and 15 questions to answer 1.33 min to answer each question. I don't understand why the cutoff is so high. What's the logic behind making it impossible to get an A. I may drop,"Well organized class and a great class for python beginners. HOWEVER! The grading scale needs your extra attention. 96 for an A and 93 for a B: if you miss a single assignment, you will lower your grade by a whole level. Take the class with great caution ( don't miss any homework or quizzes), and it will be a good experience for you.","after several weeks, I checked his grading scale to find out that 94.99 or something close to that was just a B+. Who gives 94.99 a B+? Then I decided to drop the course. Oh, and besides he is really demeaning to students. I have any seen a professor who answers ""If you don't like it drop the course."" But I still think it's very useful course tho.","The class was excellently organized and well structured. My main beef with Brunner is that he comes off as totally dislikable and lacking proper social skills. When some of the students in INFO 490 asked repetitive questions, the responses he gave to these posts were condescending and terrible. Intelligent guy, good teacher, bad social skills.",One of my favorite profs at uiuc. Hands down.,"Professor Brunner has great sense of humor, and ASTR 330 is a fun class that involved multiple disciplines. This course is fun and easy to follow. This is a course that worth taking. But I have to say some of the statements in the slides about the culture, especially Asian culture, have been wrong.","Professor Brunner is probably the best science professor this school has to offer.  Lively, funny, and entertaining with a knack for explaining topics.","Lectures are somewhat helpful, but not mandatory. He gets you to come to lecture by using iClickers. You need to read the book.  It is quite a bit of reading. If you can get into his discussion section DO IT! He is very helpful when it comes to specific questions. He is hot (for a soccer dad). ;)","Professor Brunner may have some difficult topics to teach, but his excellent teaching skills gives students a better understanding of what they need to learn...","As people have said before the homework is kinda hard, but you get used to it and some of the material is just foreign because its about stars, but professor Brunner is just overall a very good guy. he will answer all your questions and really wants to help you and knows his stuff. He also is hilarious i hope i get another professor like him.","Professor Brunner is a great instructor. People knocking how hard the class is obviously have no interest in the subject. That's all it really takes to get a B in the class. Generous curves on the tests, and takes comments into consideration for changing/shortening homework assignments. Plus he's got a sense of humor. Thumbs up.","Do not take this course if you're just looking to learn about stars and the sun. This is a quant II and without prior physics or astronomy background, can seem overwhelming. He is a very passionate teacher and a fun guy, though.",I loved Prof. Brunner! He's a really nice guy and a cool teacher! He knows his stuff! Gives GREAT curves for tests!,DO NOT TAKE ASTR 122 WITH BRUNNER!!!!! It is very complicated. It involves very complicated equations.

Discussion was optional, but I advise that you go.","He is incredibly enthusiastic and energetic. He is a great lecturer, even though the material itself is really boring. Try to go as often as you can because he will often include really interesting historical segments regarding the subject at hand. I did not go to office hour, but he seems like a very kind and approachable guy.","He actually cares about students - there's just so many in this class that it's hard to really connect with him in any meaningful way. He makes economics fun. If you pay attention in class, do the extra credit, and use the study booklet you should have a fairly easy A.","He's a good professor who definitely is very passionate about the subject, but the class was way too basic and easy, especially since you get so many practice exams that are very close to the exams.","ECON 302 is just not a hard course. I found his lecture quite tedious because he digs on to something really easy, but doesn't cover that much important stuff (like he has 50 slides of doing derivatives but just skims through important concepts).",He thoroughly explains simple concepts but does not prepare you for the super difficult exams. He offers LOTS of extra credit and the online homework is super easy.,"Professor Buckley is a fantastic lecturer. If you go to class and the discussion sections a majority of the time and do the workbook problems, you'll get an A. He's also accessible outside of class if you need any help. He genuinely cares about his students.","Bryan isn't the most exciting lecturer, but he is good at explaining the material. Class is optional and he posts all of the lectures online. If you take his class, I recommend doing the extra credit mastery points on the homework site.","Buckley is a decent teacher but wastes so much time in lecture talking about the simplest concepts.  However, the tests are difficult and full of tricky questions. He does not curve tests. He lets you skip tests, but that is a poor strategy, and I have no clue why he offers it. He goes off on tangents about his opinions. Be ready to teach yourself"
1863188,2.9,Cynthia,Buckley,13,0.40188525712591255,"Professor Buckley was a great professor, she was incredibly caring. After the first week of class, she knew my name. She is very interesting and passionate about what she teaches. While she gives a lot of pop quizzes, they are expected, and cover lectures and reading. I would recommend taking a class from her!","Fun at first, but you figure out she's condescending. Unprofessional with the TA in class. Wrote immature comments because students complained about her typos. Didn't give equal resources for students that wrote a final paper versus taking the final exam. Don't want other students to go through this awful experience, too.","Go to class, says Fridays are optional but if you do not show up she judges you. Phony, tells you one thing and does another. Kinda all over the place but she's relatively nice during the lectures and she's funny, too. Very fake though.",Professor Buckley is one of the smartest people I have ever met. She is personable and approachable. Don't let the comments on here scare you off of give you a bad impression of her. You don't even have to love sociology to do well. Just show up and participate and do your work and I promise your grade will be excellent and BOY will you learn. &lt;3,Easy if you do required work. Learned a lot and got an internship,I have never had a teacher who let her emotions affect what grade a person is getting. In all my life I have never had a teacher this awful. Don't take her class.,"I would not recommend, very condescending rather than helpful","Unfair exams, unprofessional teacher-student communication, lack of consistency","At first I was excited to take her class, but quickly realized that the lectures are repetitive and incredibly boring. She would often spend 15 minutes on one slide, retelling the same anecdote about one of her family members. In addition, though she tried to give helpful feedback, she came across as overly critical and harsh.","Dr. Buckley is one of the worst professors I've had at UIUC. I took this class because it's a 100 level sociology course, and it sounded interesting, so I thought ""how hard could it be""? Her expectations are not clearly stated, she rambles in lectures, and she grades students' papers like they are submitting their dissertation. Would not recommend.","At first, you might think she is really nice but she is actually very condescending.  She has pretty high expectations for an undergrad level course in my opinion but it is doable. She just makes you do a lot of little assignments that pointless. Tests are hard and specific. i really liked the subject but not her, she was really fake.","Good teacher all around, but class can be tough.",Rewrites to higher grade a plus

He tries his best to teach the class with experiments and images to make the already insipid topic, less mundane. One quality I really like about him is that he always accepts doubts and questions and answers them there or in a later lecture.",Phys 214 is a challenging one. It takes time for you to digest what is going on during the lectures. Prof. Budakian is willing to answer all kinds of questions and his lecture ppt is also straightforward.,Pro Budakian is an okay professor. What he did was that he just read everything off the PPT and sometime derive it. Class is boring. His midterm is okay and final is hard.,"Budakian taught PHYS 214 really well. His lectures are extremely helpful and he explains things over and over so you can properly understand the concept. He encourages students to ask questions, so don't be afraid to. No doubt, the class is hard, but if you persevere, try to understand and enjoy the material, you will be completely fine.","Budakian is an alright teacher, although he can be a little short at times. He knew the material very well but sometimes had trouble clarifying difficult concepts to students.","Professor does tend to be confusing at times, and makes assumptions that you know the material, but that tends to be common in UIUC physics 211/212 classes as there are prelectures before the lecture. He is an alright lecturer, just make sure you learn the material before the tests, tests are tough.",Sometimes he would confuse himself in teaching the material. Not a good lecturer at all.,He can't explain things clearly. Always takes the hard approach and sometimes get confused himself.,"Raffi is a nice guy and he tries to teach the material as best as he can. I get a little sick of his ""you guys should really know this stuff, you need to do better"" comments. Obviously we don't know what we're just learning, lol. Besides that he's fine.  He's quite good at answering questions.","Professor Budakian was a decent lecturer who generally was able to explain the material somewhat clearly. He is not as good as some of the other 213 professors, like Kwiat, but he's OK. And his exams are quite fair.","I thought he did a pretty good job. The topics in the class are very abstract, so lecture was really hard until i started reading the lesson before coming. It was still difficult, but he tries really hard to help. Sometimes, he explains things the hard way instead of simply, but he has good intentions",The class is difficult since the concepts are very far-fetched. It is hard to follow the professor's thought process and it seems there is a lot of unnecessary work done at times. Things get complicated and doesn't always use the simplest methods. He's a nice guy and tries his best and it's not his fault the class is structured the way it is.,"he is super motivated to teach, and you can tell he enjoys it. going to class is optional--there were iclickers but he ended up giving everyone all of the points because he hates them so much. Tests are easy enough, just memorize past test questions. don't buy the book."

I find this class much easier than Psyc 201 to be honest.,"Dr. Buetti is an excellent professor and Psych 230 is definitely worth taking! The teaching style is filled with examples, in-class activities, as well as the possibility for extra credit points for coming to class. The class is a lecture style but it is also interactive. The content is very interesting focusing on sensation and perception.",Best professor at UIUC,SHE IS SO NICE. Her lectures aren't mandatory but they count towards extra credit. She has an accent but its adorable and it's not hard to understand.  She posts the lectures online and any other info can be found in the book but its not mandatory to have. She gives a lot of extra credit and is always willing to answer questions.,I love Simona's teaching style and pretty much everything else about her. She definitely cares about her students' success and is willing to help anybody out. There are 3 exams and a ton of extra credit. TAKE THIS CLASS!!

He was a terrible, terrible person who was not MATURE enough to realize my genius.","I took this class as a James scholar. ACE 100H WAS SO HARD! Super accelerated-I fell behind FAST. The NIGHTLY hwk was really hard but DSB always gave me pity points. He's a nice guy, very approachable. Luckily he knows how hard the class is and didn't give any of us lower than a C (I prob deserved an F).

The class itself was well-taught.,No Comments,No Comments,"Biggest pompous ass professor that I have ever met. I failed one exam because of his unclear directions and could not bring my grade up. I hate this man. He also would edit his assignments constantly and make us work on each one of his profread assignments, which took more time. And they were all about fish taco stands.",This class was the most annoying class that I have ever taken. His assignments were not only unhelpful but also he would edit them the day before we needed to turn them in. His directions were unclear and his review sessions were terrible.,No Comments,He was a real pain when it came to grades.  Was not fair in assesing students knowledge.  This was my least enjoyable business course.,He is a very poor teacher. He disprespects students and is a bad person.

Don't expect anything to be handed to you, but his expectations are clear and you cannot fault anyone but yourself for failure.  Help is offered if sought out.","He is really strict on giving out partial credits. Even if you demonstrate that you understand the concepts (specifically, showing all equations right), you would receive a 0 for making one computational mistake (e.g. by punching the wrong number in your calculator by accident).","He does an okay job explaining the material but he has no patience in dealing with students. He set very strict roles on exam to avoid arguing with you. For example you can only use specific brand and type of calculator; you only have one chance for regrade, if you miss that day you won't get regraded even if the grading is wrong.","Bullock is a poor teacher and you have to learn from the TA. The TA was inadequate and taught us different material than what was required on the test. This resulted in perfect homework and quiz scores, but low exam grades. The exam questions are vague and no credit is awarded even if it is clear you know the material. Do not take this class.","Very difficult class. Weekly homework assignments take a ton of time, weekly quizzes are pretty difficult depending on your TA, and lectures cover very irrelevant material and move very quickly. Tests are very similar to the practice tests but the few changes made are often very tricky. If you are a business student take econ 203 instead!",He is very condescending with his students. He goes through the material so fast and just expects students to understand it. Quizzes aren't any too easy and the homework talked FOREVER! Super boring class and you have to teach yourself. I don't know what stats class is easy but not this.,"Dr. Bullock does a great job teaching stats. The textbook he uses is very good and he follows it well. However, if you are not serious about learning stats, you will fail. If you are willing to put in the time and effort to learn, he is willing to put in the time and effort to teach you.","Dr. Bullock is one of the best Professors I ever had. His classes are useful and his didactic is excellent. You have to work a lot, that's true, but the amount of work is appropriate for a graduate student. If you are lazy, too busy or both, don't take this class. That's the same for CPS541 and CPS 542.","If you can take another stats course, I would recommend that you do. The amount of time and effort (and stress) you will put in to this course is not worth what you get out of it. Prof. Bullock's course policies are getting stricter and stricter by year. He does not respect his students and gets little respect in return.","The guy is a decent teacher, but his class is not very enjoyable.  The homework takes an exceptionally long time but is doable.  He also leads on like he is very helpful and interested in the student but when talking to him he is very condescending and is pretty rude. If he would drop his arrogance his class would be much better."

There is also a doable amount of homework. Toni constantly invites students to meet with her outside of class.","Toni is a great professor! Her lectures are very engaging and she does an amazing job breaking down the concepts so it's easier for students to understand. The tests are super easy if you study the iClicker questions, notes from class, online quizzes, and online mini assignments. I highly recommend taking this class!","Toni is the best! She is so helpful both in and outside of class, and actually makes lecture interesting and go by fast. The workload for this class is light (about 30 min a week), and test questions come straight from her PowerPoint slides. Would totally recommend this class if you need a life science credit, or just an easy class to take.","This class is a great class to take for a science gen-ed. Toni sets you up to do well in the class and she makes sure everyone has the ability to get an A. If you do well on the assignments each week, go to class and actually listen and study for tests you're sure to do well and actually get something out of the class that will impact your health.",I am so glad I I took this class my freshman year. Toni does everything she can to make sure that all of her students succeed- this includes offering a lot of extra credit. If you are looking for a easy and fun life sciences GedEd then this is the perfect option. Just pay attention in lecture and go over some notes and you will be just fine.,"If you are looking for an easy class to take this summer/upcoming semesters, I would really recommend taking FSHN 120. It is an interesting class that teaches you about human nutrition. Even if you aren't going into healthcare, it is still a class that is applicable to anyone's life. The workload is not 'too much' at all! Everything i",Her lectures were super interesting and she was very nice. I would take the class again if I could.,"I loved Toni. I took FSHN 120 as a blowoff gen-ed, but she made me love nutrition and food sciences. She's an amazing lecturer and the content is actually very interesting. I hope she teaches more in-person classes, so that I can be her student again.","I absolutely loved professor Burkhalter's class. As a humanities major, I found FSHN 120 to be not only incredibly interesting but also very helpful. Professor Burkhalter gives interesting lectures and is beyond fair when it comes to grading. If you are looking to fulfill a gen-ed requirement with a great professor, take FSHN 120."
714570,2.2,Anne,Burkus-Chasson,24,0.376683810277752,"Professor Burkus is an extraordinary professor. She is an expert in Chinese art, and her passion is truly contagious and inspirational. I was often moved by her lectures. She genuinely cares about her students, too.","Professor Burkus is a highly sophisticated Asian Art scholar who genuinely cares about her students if they show respect and passion towards her and the work that she teaches. Be ready to show up and contribute to class discussion, then she will be the most helpful and caring professor ever!","Horrible professor, drop out of her class PRONTO, I wish I had.","Took GCL 129 but was nothing as advertised in the course explorer. The class required 5 books that weren't even widely used. The professor lacked the knowledge to connect the course to what she was trying to explain to the students. 4 main papers, one group project, and a heavy focus on sinology. Her grading is harsh but will negotiate.","GCL129 was not what was advertised on course explorer -- focused on design as in art, not buildings and infrastructure (what I expected). However, had a good time in class. However, she really grades based on how much she likes you, not very subjective. If you participate and engage with her, you should have an easy time.",She only want to do things her own way. Hates African arts for sure. I am not interested in the topic she suggested me to write on and got mad at me. She only cares about Chinese art.,"Professor Burkus is genuine, kind, and extremely knowledgeable. She really cares about her students and her classes are very engaging.","Prof. Burkus is one of the best professors I've ever met. She sincerely cares for her students, and tries her best to make course materials easier to understand for students, for instance, by giving out bullet-point summaries of some of the hard readings. Her course load is far from heavy, and I find her assignments very interesting and inspiring.","Very nice old lady. Knows a lot about China and Japan. She lived in Japan for 2 or 3 years to do research. Willing to help if u have questions. However, the lecture is unclear. You have to take note and follow her in class. Grading was not hard. 1 group project and 2 exams. Quizzes were mostly cancelled.","I don't know why her rates are so low. She was certainly a very helpful professor(emails always sent back with good feedback). She always listens to students' opinions(result: the tough weekly quizzes disappeared) I have to see how her class would go this semester because I'm taking her 400 level course. So far, tho, she was great.",awful professor. Lectures are boring and rambling and tests ask you to read her mind. You can understand all of the material and still get things wrong because you don't give the exact answer she's looking for.,She is not that bad. The review sheets she gave for the test is very helpful.,Totally not what I expected for art history. Never talked clear except getting mad with TA's or students. Can't hear any full sentences if you're not sitting in the first five rows. But there was no quiz/test/exam so that's kind of good.,"Completely unorganized and unfocused ramblings make up her lectures, which are impossible to follow. Everyone leaves each class utterly puzzled, making writing papers very difficult since nothing is learned. She also cannot accept differing opinions and tries to convince you that you're wrong, even though everything she utters is nonsense.","I have to say she knows a lot, but she doesn't know how to teach at all. The class is hard for me cuz she didn't really teach anything and I still have to write the class papers.","The entirety of the class seems to be in agreement that nobody, at any time, has a clue what she is talking about or what we need to do for the class. She tends to ramble on, rather incomprehensibly. She is, however, very knowledgeable on the subject, she just simply does not make for a good professor. I surely wouldn't recommend any class of hers.","Doesn't communicate what is expected of students to the RA's, then gets upset with them for helping us too much...she has also spent much of the lectures trying to pronounce words in Chinese. Would not recommend.","No syllabus until 4th week, pauses films every two minutes to natter on about the camera angles for 20, expects people to come in familiar with things completely outside the class material/prereqs. Far, far, far too disorganized and high-strung to be teaching.","Extremely well-informed, probably an excellent scholar, but not good as a professor. Cannot keep to a schedule at ALL, rambles on in lecture (although it's usually interesting if you're into the subject), cut out a good chunk of our initial syllabus as a result. She can get angry if you don't ""get"" the point.","She is so disorganized and boring.  She means well and her ideas are great!  She can't execute them though and things just get jumbled up and i never know what i am doing or what i should write down in the class.  In my opinion, it is very hard to take descents notes..."
1854818,5.0,Lisa,Burner,1,0.7664087965912405,Very helpful and passionate about her subject. Will go out of her way to help you with whatever you need on your projects. Fairly easy grader as well. I would recommend her!
1908467,3.0,Justin,Burner,1,0.2199727137065947,he''s an ok professor. got a B+. I knew I couldv gotten an A if I tried harder. curved all the exams except the first one. like all calc classes at uiuc you gotta work in groups and complete worksheets. hard to understand material the first few times he explained it. interesting guy. spoke fluent chinese and sewed his own bow ties. yeah... bow ties.
185641,3.8,Scott,Burns,9,0.4471399124286908,amazing!,"Very good at lecturing.  He makes the subject interesting.  I thought structural analysis was boring until I took this class.  He is not a particularly  easy grader, but he wants everyone to do well.","Great professor when teaching in class, but shows no mercy when it comes to exams. Get great grades on your homework cause if not that can kill you in the end.",class is not well organized - lectures are all over the place. tests do not represent the in-class material either.,"This class is awesome and very easy. Burns bases his grade on attendance and projects, which are very easy and most of the time he doesn't even check them. He's pretty cool too.","lectures are dry, despite seeking assistance there regularly did not found office hours to be of much help. notes don't cut it, but does not utilize any text well - or at all, for that matter.",Really cool class. Hands on experience in engineering. Great 1 hour course to pick up for half of the semester.,No Comments,He's really cool... except that he thinks that his studends are pigs..... and his really corney jokes!!
1539219,4.0,Laura,Burns,3,0.21744229029242787,"She's fine i guess, pretty hard grader for what should be a very easy class. Needs to learn she's teaching a 100 level and is extremely picky with the structure of speeches rather than the actually delivery of speeches which is very annoying and discouraging. Speeches take a lot of time to get ready for but otherwise theres not that much work.","ms burns is pretty cool. grades pretty hard but nothing too bad. class helped my speaking skills, but was a pain to write and memorize speeches.","She is sort of a tough grader, but nothing horrible."
1054947,2.5,Jennifer,Burns,20,0.36922055263073644,The lecturer is not inspirational at all conducting dull lectures and useless materials. She is also extremely harsh to students without any caring mind. Do not ever consider her courses. She is the worst professor ever!,"Horrible professor. Probably one of the worst I've had. Disorganized, scatter-brained, and lectures make no sense. Made the whole lecture buy iClickers and used them maybe twice. Would ask questions on the exam that weren't discussed in class. Didn't have a syllabus until maybe the 8th-9th week of class. Highly advise against taking her class.","This woman is so smart and she knows what she's talking about and it's so clear that she is passionate about art history, but she is not organized whatsoever. Her presentations, while thorough, were all over the place and never what she said we'd be learning. Was there really ever a topic for the day? I just don't know. Also don't buy the textbook.","Really good professor, passionate and she knows what she is talking about. Caring. Happy to have taken her class.","really effort on making class clear and cares about , exams , people . Really good theoric classes.","Never sticks to syllabus, scatterbrained, when teaching I've never responded seriously.  Shes cancelled class 4 times this semester for being sick.  Assigns projects anyways.","The test is horrible, not related to any thing she said on class. Nor fair to those who made effort and study hard. Not organized class, always promise with stuff like study guide but never provide it. Not replying email",She is always laughing during the class with no reason and her class is not funny at all...,"Incredibly nice, passionate about art history","disorganized, not funny... why is she teaching?","ARTH 115 is a great class and you won't find it frustrating if you enjoy learning about art. Prof. Burns is a bit organized but great speaker, very clear. You learn a lot of history in an enjoyable way. If you like art and writing, this is an easy and enjoyable class for you.",She wont help you with anything.  She is a horrible lecturer.,THE WORST TEACHER EVER!!!!! She is so clueless and has zero structure. She had to throw out our 2nd test because she didn't prepare us for how to study the material. SO FRUSTRATING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This is the most unstructured class EVER. Jennifer rambles on forever about one topic and NEVER finishes a lecture completely. The material is interesting if you like art but it is so scattered and she ruins it by dragging it on and on. She is not clear about anything and there's always something that goes wrong in class (missing tests on test day),Terrible...,terrible!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,ARTH 115 was really easy,"She's a little scatterbrained, but def. easy to talk to. She's probably the nicest professor I've ever had here...",No Comments,"she teaches something in class, and then the next time we meet, she ALWAYS ends up saying, ""I'm sorry, I taught that wrong,"" or ""I'm sorry, I wish I would've taught you differently..."" her sense of style can also be described as horrendously confused."

281470,1.9,Vernon,Burton,12,0.38386072302408736,The worst professor ever.  He was a complete joke and an embarrassment to the U of I.  One only wonders how he won teaching awards?  A true crime.,SOOOOOO boring. Not very organinized. Jumps around a lot in lecture,"Ok, this class was easy. You basically don't need to buy the text book cause you'll never use it. Also, its best to take the class with a friend cause it makes going to lecture not as bad (you really don't need to go...). The final was 30 something matching questions which he gave you. 3 papers which were graded really easily in my opinion.","I hated this guy, he was a real prick.  Didn't talk about any history, all he talked about was how **** caucasians are.","He knows his stuff. The tests are easy, but his lectures are very hard to follow. He is all over the place. Hope you have a good TA. Easy class to get work done, or a good nap in.","this was the biggest waste of time. You had to teach yourself everything and you never really knew what was on the tests, because they were based in his opinions, which were impossible to discern form lecture. There was no logic to the the class or the assignments, which were terrible.",good lecture to take a nap in...,The man definitely knows what he's talking about. We don't. His lectures are scatterbrained and more like soapbox-rants than actual informative lectures. Pray you have a good TA.,"I agree with the other reviewer. Lecture seems to be pointless, he is all over the place. Everything has to be done on your own. If you read the book, the exams won't be too bad (ID's and essay)","His lectures make me depressed and are totally unfocused.  He talks funny.  Not in a cute way. But the works is all kinda on your own, if you do it you'll do fine.  Hes just pretty boring.",He is passionate about history and is good at relating to students and making them interested in the subject.  Professor Burton treats his students as equals and really helps them learn.,"likes his little town in South Carolina WAY too much.  otherwise, not a bad prof.  his TAs were really good, too"
379366,3.1,Antoinette,Burton,17,0.5315194928353418,Just do yourself a favor and don't take this class.,"I liked her at first and then the first test happened. I could get past that. But in general she is a very snarky and pretentious human being. After midterm course evals, she's been borderline cruel because apparently people were 'mean' to her. Can't take criticism even if it's constructive AND she asked us for it. Also.. 7 books are required ...",I took this class as a gen ed and to tell the truth it was about the easiest class i've ever taken. While the grading will be subjective to the TA's she outlines everything for her tests and her final. The readings she assigns are kind of suggestions to me but they will help when you have to memorize the ID's for the exam. Class is not that bad.,"Honestly, she's not that bad. She may ask a lot, but she explains exactly what she wants in tests and papers. She reviews before tests and gives answers. Everything is really structured. The TAs are great. Reading is extremely heavy but you can get by skimming. Attendance is semi-mandatory sometimes there's in class assignments.","I have to disagree. While she is very intelligent, she knows little of World History.  She teaches her intro level class as if it was a 300/400 level class and amount of required work/exams is rather ridiculous for a 100 level class.  I am currently a history major but if this was my 1st experience in history, I would never consider the major.","She knows what she is talking about but flies through the entire lecture.  She assigns readings completely different from class, and the readings are ridiculously boring!  Definitely not an introductory history course!!","BORING AS SIN!!! I don't even go to this class 1. because it's at 9am and 2. because I just fall asleep in it anyway, so why not just stay in bed?! She assigns readings from the books, yet talks about completely different things in lecture. One good thing is that she knows what she is talking about.",I thought we was a great professor. Very intelligent and selected interesting readings. I enjoyed going to her class everyday. Makes complex ideas very clear.,Cars more about her reputation than her students,"Whoever claims that Professor Burton is an idiot demonstrates their own mental shortcomings. Not only is she a brilliant scholar, but she is a very helpful and compassionate instructor.",I really enjoyed this class. She really helped me out with a lecture project. Teaching at U of I can't be easy but she makes it look like it. She uses best practices at the college level.,She is very intelligent and an amazing teacher. I learned a lot...picks interesting readings to go along with the course.,"I had her for history 341, and I thought she was an amazing teacher, one of the best I've had.","i havent learned anything...big lecture, which was nice at first...but there is not really a good source of help to see you are doing poorly.  tests are IDs, and a take home final of IDs and a short essay...but definitly NOT an intro history course!","the course sucked at first but she noticed it was hard and chilled out a little...3 exams, last one was take home and that was it","She's an idiot.  I have no clue how she got her PhD, much less a teaching position.  This class is the biggest waste of time ever.  If it's required for you,wait for a competent professor","while very intelligent, she doesn't clearly communicate what we need to know."

Quizzes are not that hard if you pay attention to every single lecture. Always show up at her office hour and it is extremely helpful! Her grading is very generous because she understands there are many seniors in our class.  Strongly recommend!,Jane is AWESOME!  She's so clear and helfpul.  Just work hard and show your work and you'll get an A.  She's totally fair.  Warning: slackers should NOT take anything from Jane.  She's hardcore!
