Tests are scantrons, but detailed. Do your readings and you're fine! Powerpoints from lecture are posted on Compass","Her tests are crazy. Her exam reviews are worthless. You have to read.

The class is useless; full of common sense with little insight into anything else. On the bright side, easy A.","This class was very easy, but completely awful.  Prof. Connell's lecture slides were a straight regurgitation of the readings for the class; no extra insight was provided by going to lecture.

Great progression of logic during lectures (even for very abstract concepts), super enthusiastic and receptive to questions of all kinds.  Tests are very reasonable and straightforward, homework ranges in difficulty but is always interesting and relevant.","Ivan is a really fantastic instructor. He can explain those tough materials very well. He often asks students about how to think this question instead of just give you the answer, which help us think a lot during lectures. To be honest, this kind of thinking method really helps you in the exam and in the future learning.","Ivan is a very good instructor, you don't want to miss his lecture. He is pleased and patient to answer your questions after course.

I wanted to like her, and she's definitely intelligent, but she has a terrible attitude and seems to enjoy making students uncomfortable/insecure about their work. She could be a brilliant prof if she wasn't on such a power trip. Don't do it!","Great professor, yes she can be tough she gives a lot of work but it's worth it. She is very passionate about her field. If you read your be fine. If I could i would take another class with her!!",Courtemanche seems like she'd be a better professor in a small discussion class rather than a big lecture class. I felt like a lot of her lecture content was useless -- her lectures didn't help me understand the texts better or added anything substantial to my learning.,"She was nice and I enjoyed the readings she chose. However, she was a bit disorganized at times and easily got off track. Overall a good teacher though, and not too difficult of a grader esp. by the end of the semester","She likes English and she likes to teach it, you can really tell. Her lectures are clear, the text analysis is really good. She maintains an great balance in focusing on the major theme and smaller details of a novel. A fair grader, not too hard though.","Best professor I've ever had. Really well versed on her subject matter.You'll feel so much smarter after a semester. You have to be willing to do the work for the paper though, but if you push yourself you'll be proud of your work in the long run. As far as lectures go, show up and listen. That's all you really need to do. She knows how to teach.","One of the worst teachers I have had. If you like your English classes like High School then take this. If you like to think critically, or think at all, don't take this class.","Her class is always entertaining. It's fun listening to her because she is so intelligent. Her grading is a little difficult, however, and her class can be a little disorderly.","Way too interested in micromanaging students. Very smart, though. Tough grader. Classroom atmosphere more akin to high school than university. Often frustrates students by commandeering discussions.","I love her, but she's hard.  If you write a paper, you have to be prepared- you can't just wing it.  The class takes a lot of work, but it's worth it because she's so funny and so intelligent.","She's a very good teacher, and does love her subject. However, the reading can get to be a lot, and you do need to stay up on it. She also seems like she's not very open to ideas that aren't her own, so it might be hard for more conservative minded students. However, if you can back up a conservative point, she will listen to your argument.","Very enthusiastic, knows her stuff, great readings.","One of my very favorite professors at this university: she's smart, funny, and genuinely excited about the subject matter! She IS a tough grader, and her classes do involve a lot of reading, but I feel that she influenced my college experience for the better, which makes it all worth it. Take her class!","I loved her class and all of the readings she gave us.  She was a hard grader, but if you go to office hours it will really help your grade on papers.  She obviously loves her subject matter and that really comes across when she's teaching.  She began my interest in Victorian Lit (even if Bleak House was 800 pages!)","Enthuastic, hilarious","The professor is very knowledgable on the subject, I'll give her credit for that. She is very harder grader, though. Had a hard time keeping up with the reading. She gives a lot of homework. If you're a slack-off, then this isn't the class for you.",Very knowledgable on the subject matter. Many of the students in my class did not like her because she can be a hard grader on papers. Be sure to go to office hours for papers. She's also a bit condescending. But she really is enlightening and excited about British Literature. And I read about 1/2 of each book and didn't miss a class at got a B+.,"Very amiable, interesting prof.  LOTS OF READING.  As long as you turn in assignments and come to class, you should at least get a B+.  Ask for her help with papers."

Bad explanation for tax problem. Make a lot of mistake in class (she always said I woops I was wrong in the last section...) Cancelled class without any notice in advance.,"Awful teacher. Disorganized, clueless, lazy, rude, a liar, oblivious, and harsh all rolled into one professor. The worst teacher I have had by far at the U of I. Didn't follow syllabus at all.

There are several small papers so your grade isn't dependent on just one or two assignments, and he lets you revise everything for a new grade except the final. He's really helpful &amp; entertaining. The books are all really good too.","David is awesome. Really interesting books and facilitates class discussion really well. He lets you resubmit every paper for more points. He also gives extra credit opportunities at the end of the semester.  Participation is part of the grade so you have to show up for class, but he makes it worth going!","He makes you read books that are suposebly intro to latino literature, but the books we read are irrelevant. He is not specific on what he wants from us. He swears a lot which if funny. He gets too technical with simple things. You can't just write the essays by giving the plot.

However, there are NOT a lot of opportunities for points. Your grade is ultimately determined by 3 tests (which are only out of about 40 points) and some reading responses if you choose to do those. She was not clear about how important the tests were, so it's easy to not do well in the class.",She seriously rocks and is so smart. This News Literacy class was so interesting and I would take it every semester if I could. No tests; just assignments.,"She is a amazing professor, but you have to work for it.

She spends a lot of time on more specific grammar, but it's worth it to sit through.","Make sure you review homework for tests.

Though there is a good amount of writing required, the subject matter is pretty straight forward.  Just watch movies and respond to them. Crane is very nice too!","Lectures could be better classified as sermons. There wasn't much material to be learned in the class as long as you know that people with disabilities are still people.

They do no test your understanding of the material. The rest of the class is easy, however I ended up with an 89.8% final grade in the class. She does not round up and the class is not graded with + or -, so I got a B in the end.","She is probably the most awful teacher I have had in the past four years. The class format is confusing, and she is unwilling to answer any questions directly. She will just tell you to ""look at the syllabus."" If there is a technological problem on Compass (which happens often), she will refuse to allow late submissions by even a minute.","The online class was stressful, but I ended up with an A. She uses a small curve, but does not round after that. The quizzes are tough, but everything else is relatively simple.","This class was pretty easy but very boring. The Powerpoint exams, though, were kind of annoying. Mrs. Cravens was a decent instructor, so I don't understand all the negative reviews here. Compared to science classes on campus, this class is a cake walk. Textbook not necessary.","This is the worst professor I have ever had at UIUC, really disappointing.  Respect is mutual, you give respect and you will get respect. She doesn't give respect.  She doesn't seem to put in the appropriate effort a professor should put into their job and she has a horrible attitude.  Disappointing,pulls down overall UIUC professor ratings.","one of the worst teachers ever. exams are hard as hell, and are multiple choices shown by ridiculous powerpoint slides. no curve. no plus and minus either. it would make an A only when above 90%. Terrible class","This is a terrible teacher. Her class are boring and pointless, you only even need to go to watch movies while she sits on her computer in the front. Plus she has a terrible attitude and is extremely unhelpful and, in my opinion, rather rude. The kind of person I'd rather just avoid.","She doesn't offer conflict exams for ANY REASON, even if you have another exam at the same time. Surely this is against university policy! She talks big about respect, but comes up empty. She is so unaccommodating, you feel as though you are bothering her to just do her job, which ends up being watching TV all lecture period. That's not teaching!!!",Class is not that easy if you are looking for an easy A. The tests were very specific and there was so much random material. Thought this would be an easy A but got a B instead. There is no + and - which makes it even worse.,"Mrs. Cravens is a great teacher and a nice person. I genuinely enjoyed the class. Assignments as really easy (one page, double spaced!), tests are multiple choice.","The most annoying voice ever!  Lectures are a waste of time.  Some of the video clips we watch are pointless, but It's a real easy class.  She's not very up to date with things, her methods for turning in assignments on compass are ridiculous, and so are her powerpoint tests.","Cravens is a very easy teacher. She gives exams on an overhead which is a little annoying, but the exams are super-easy. Class time is mostly spent watching movies and youtube clips. This class should be an easy A if you go to class and turn in the assignments on time.",Jennifer Cravens signs at the level of a three year old.  Loved her.,This is a VERY EASY gen ed.

Thanks to Professor Ramon Soto-Crespo, one can enjoy this class without any relevant background; the secrets to success are to read, to think, and to think more. The coursework is moderate and can fit in a busy schedule. Fame awaits future writers!","Prof. Ramon is a professor unlike any other. You will learn so many things while having a blast and being unable to control your laughter. He engages all his students in the discussions and preaches a classroom atmosphere where everyone can share their thoughts. Couple essays, couple exams, everything manageable and nothing over the top!","I am not usually a fan of American literature, but the variety that Soto Crespo had us read this semester was fantastic. Most of the readings are on the website, except for two novels that we had to buy and read. The essays are short and graded easily. Every student has to present on a reading. Tests aren't hard. Good intro level course for English","Mr. Soto-Crespo is a wonderful professor. While you do read many things, they are often short stories and he gives you the PDFs instead of making you find them yourselves. He really engages the class in discussion and makes you feel like your opinion matters. Overall, one of my favorite classes so far. Just do the reading and you will be fine.","I really loved this class! it's largely just a group discussion class with a few page 2-3 papers and one presentation that I found pretty easy. Besides that and reading, there's no other homework. Ramon is a funny and interesting prof who really enjoys the class and makes it fun"

Does a poor job at getting you excited about learning the material, he's pretty boring.","as other reviewers mention, cronan can be monotonous.  nonetheless, he is one of the most intelligent teachers, explains the WHY behind the concepts (no spoon fed slides), and is a genuinely nice guy.

She definitely tries to give you as much background and useful information as possible when explaining slides. overall good class and good teacher.",Your grade depends on your TA. Show up to lecture and get participation credit for iClicker questions.,Dr. Crowston treats every student with a positive attitude. Since this is a honors class extensive amount of writings and readings are expected. She is very rewarding so every one will earn an A. She is talkative and an amazing lecturer,"She is a good lecture, the class is interesting, but exams and papers are somehow challenge because not only need a lot to memorize, also understanding important themes to do well, 3 exams, 1 paper and the rest are attendance grades, still recommend this class","i took this class last spring. prof crowston is a great lecturer, i think. but her exams are a little hard; lots of ID's and you are held accountable for a lot of primary sources. The class isn't ridiculous, but you should be ready to do some work. this is not a blow-off class.","IF you are not required to take this class, I highly recommend you stay away from this class.  The exams require too much information to be memorized, and you do not get enough time on the exams to express what you have learned. Grade depends solely on the TA.","Annoying difficult for a gen ed. The tests are almost impossible to study for. 60 Id terms and you have to write a huge amount on four? Ridiculous. Overall, the grade is decided by TAs, so hopefully you'll get a good one.",This class was so hard.  The tests were nearly impossible to study for.  There was so much information that you could not know it all for the exams.  I also had a bad TA so that may have had something to do with it.

Study the material well and you will do fine. no homework- just a paper and 3 exams.,Great lecturer and really cares.  Overall class depends on TA but highly suggest crowston for just a solid elective,Lecture is useless since all essays and IDs for tests are given before hand and all you need to do is read the book. You do need to study a decent amount but the material is easy. Just be prepared to do a lot of reading. Discussion attendance is mandatory but you can get EC at the end to make up for it if you dont go.,"Like most beginner level history classes this one really depends on the TA you have. Prof. Crowston is a great lecturer, she is passionate about what she does and it's obvious to students. She and her TA's want their students to succeed but you do need to put in a little effort. She doesn't cover all topics in lecutre but does say to read the book!","Fairly easy course. A lot of writing, whether it is on exams or for essays. Lecture notes are put online. Lectures follow a clear and simply outline. She is passionate about early modern European history and it shows.","She's knowledgeable, but so are most professors.  Her lectures had fun bits with personal anecdotes but generally seemed pretty similar to the book.  They were interesting but helped me little in preparing for the exams.  Book all the way.  Exams were ridiculous - prepare 5 or 6 essays when ONE will be written?  60+ id terms to write 5?  Stupid.","I took her Hist 140 class in Spring 2006. Overall, it was very boring. At least I completed my history gen ed requirement.","Pretty easy class, gives you all the possible id terms and essay questions for each exam.  Class notes online and kinda pointless anyways.  As long as you define the terms she gives using the book you can get a pretty good grade.","Her lectures can get bogged down when she focuses too much on one detail and doesn't get to the main points. It's possible to get a solid B without reading the book, or without going to lecture but probably not both.  Go to section, it helps you understand concepts and attendance is taken.","She's good, class wasn't too bad. It involved a lot of small writing assignments, a bunch of 2-3 pagers, no tests.

By the way, she's at the University of Kentucky now","I thought she was very fair with her grading. She gives very generous curves on her tests. She gives us practice tests that are extremely similar to the actual exams, and it's really not that hard to receive a passing grade in her class. Sure, she depends on her notes and becomes flustered, but overall I don't think she's a bad professor!","What a terrible teacher.  She decides to bribe the class with a bell curve of 85% rather than do her job.  All this to get hired full time, perhaps there is a reason youre a visiting professor.

So do not take the Math 347 from her,if you want to survive.","Her explanations were terribly confusing and her clarifications just confused me more.

What is correct on one paper is wrong on another and when pointed out she refuses to correct her error in grading.,"She's incredibly kind, very intelligent about the subject matter, and gives fair exams. The homework can be tricky and take some time, and she becomes flustered easily during lecture, but she never angers."
1725341,2.2,Steven,Culpepper,30,0.3589087368302973,"Has a very ""I don't care"" attitude while lecturing. Weekly quizzes which seems a bit excessive. Material was difficult and he didn't take the time for everyone to grasp the difficult concepts. TA's were also useless and clueless",Worst professor Ive met. He makes the tests so hard and yet is unable to explain the concepts properly. Its hard to pay attention in class as his voice is kinda soft and theres a lot of ummm in his sentences. There were some mistakes in his notes too. Youre better off just studying the textbook.,"Worst Professor Ever. There's never certainty in any of his lectures; expect a lot of ""umm... maybe... it looks like..."" so you naturally doubt anything that he says. Also, his answers to the students' questions are always vague so you may have been better off googling the answers. In fact, you'll be better off having google as your instructor.",He makes STAT 420 the hardest and most useless statistic class I have ever taken. I am curious why he still cannot explain the content clearly even if he teaches the same class every year.,He's bad at explaining things and the midterms were hard.,Awful. 0/10. Would not recommend. Sounds boring when lecturing. Doesn't know how to explain difficult material to students. Terrible.,"He was a  nice guy but his teaching method was to have his typed notes on the projector and say ""First you do this, then this, then this"" while underlining things.  He was not good at explaining even the most basic concepts.  After lectures I could not tell you what I had learned. I would suggest trying to take another professor if at all possible.","Terrible teaching skill. He says textbook is not required, however, you will suffer if you don't read the textbook because his lecture is tedious and hard to understand.","he is just not a good teacher, terrible classroom atmosphere makes you fall asleep all the time. AVOID his course unless absolutely necessary","The class is super hard and confusing, but Professor Culpepper curves all exams and the final at the end. You can still manage at least a solid ""C"" even with bad exams scores.","Classes are boring.  He is a good professor, though, trying to teach us everything he knows.  This term, I opted out of the final and this is really great! Maybe not next time.","I've never felt compelled to rate a professor before, but he is just not a good teacher. What he covers in class is fine, but it is not especially relevant to the homework. The homework is quite challenging and the material we have not covered. He does not do examples in class. The tests aren't awful, but there is no curve (avg  65%).","Look as far as a human being, he seems like genuinely a nice guy, but in terms of teaching, he is awful. He explains super basics in class to where its almost pointless to go and then gives super tricky homework and test questions and does not say anything helpful in office hours or respond to emails at all. Basically he sees this class as a game.","I heard this class was supposed to be impossible, but to be honest I didn't find it that bad.  He did a good job explaining the concepts and really if you did the HW problems on Compass for practice the exams were super reasonable.  Was patient and didn't move on until all questions were answered.  A professor that actually liked teaching - finally","Cant explain things very well. Could not answer my question during office hour. Nice guy though, and gives relatively easy grade. But never make me to understand, and I feel I am suffering for the semesters.","This man could teach statistics to a class full of preschoolers and they would all catch on. He's the best. Super pleasant, genuinely nice, patient, and can explain difficult material in a way that makes it seem like you're simply learning the alphabet.  Awesome class.",He made the class enjoyable and gave clear lectures. He always explained things in a way that made the content seem fairly simple.  Exams were fair and not that difficult if you did the HW he assigned every week. Love the extra credit policy also. One of the best classes I've taken at U of I and one of the best professors. Definitely take the class,"Not a very good teacher, but he could be much worse. Homework can take a long time and there are usually one or two questions on test that are really hard. He offers a descent amount of extra credit to make up for lost points though.","Steve was by far one of the most reasonable and fair professors I've ever had.  Found the lectures to be useful and he explained example problems really well.  Could work on answering students' questions better, but overall a great professor. Fairly easy tests and very nice/patient/helpful during office hours. Lots of I-clicker Extra Credit ?s also","Steve is a really friendly and helpful guy.  His teaching is pretty solid and it's not too hard to get a good grade.  Attendance in this class was among the lowest i've ever seen on campus.  I would recommend going to lecture and discussion.  HW is not easy, but between Steve and the TAs you will be walked through it."

2035904,5.0,Laura,Cummings,1,0.5037245912820163,The class is online and there are no actual exams. As long as you do the homework by the deadline you are okay. Homework is to be submitted every Tuesday and Thursday online by 11:59. The only heavily weighed assignments are the three essays you do throughout the semester. She is always helpful and meets with you in person every once in a while.
871614,3.8,Denise,Cummins,14,0.5348996611654385,"While subject matter was very interesting, grading procedures were EXTREMELY vague and her syllabus was very misleading. She averages the scores of each unit, instead of taking the average of quizzes, homework, etc across the whole course. Because this was unclear, I got over half a letter grade less than what I thought I would. Also, she was rude.","You should go to class to fully understand. Even though her lectures are online, they're vague sometimes and she goes into great detail in class. IClicker points go towards your grade. Instead of tests, she does 6 ""quizzes"" and gives you the essay part in advance. I didn't do the readings which is probably why I didn't get an A. Okay class overall.","Way better than her husband. Very knowledgable about subject. Posts her notes online, and uses Iclicker for all classes she teaches. Most of her test questions are the iclickers one. She's pretty funny and incorporates outside material to keep you interested. Very good powerpoints, posted online, and lectures are pretty clear. Essay and MC tests","I didn't really like her. Her lectures were somewhat interesting, but I felt like they didn't correlate well with the exams. She can be funny at times, but otherwise she's actually kinda mean. I've heard Dell is better for 248.",She's my favorite psych professor. Her classes are always very interesting &amp; she knows what shes talking about. She shows a lot of videos to exemplify the material. The class material is overall incredibly interesting. I highly highly recommend it. Only 4 tests and you don't have to take the final if you do well enough on the other 3.,Best teacher in the psychology department! She is nice and her exams are pretty easy. So long as you go to class and review the lecture slides you should get a good grade. She also has a sense of humor and likes to show videos. Generally an awesome professor!,"This was a great intro course, lots of fun, only eight weeks, and very informative and easy. I highly recommend it!","Incredibly easy class - notes are posted online and all you need to know for the exams/homework is right there, plus she gives you a study guide. You have to attend class, however, because she uses the iClicker every day. Some of the material is interesting, but if you have half a brain most of it should be common sense.",She is a decent teacher as long as you don't have to talk with her personally about any grading issues.  She had made mistakes on the test scantrons and I missed an A cutoff by .17 and politely asked if I could come in and look over my tests.  She responded with the most rude and condescending email and obviously barely read what I had written.,"I thought D. Cummins was a clearer lecturer than R. Cummins both in class and on her notes but they're both not bad. They alternate sections of the material, and if you have a good grasp of the lectures (not even the book) you'll do fine on the exams which are MC and an essay. The same themes and examples repeat throughout the material.",She's a good lecturer with a sense of humor. She's very into the material and approachable. Tests were not take-home but fairly easy. Lectures were posted on the website. The class was taught by her and Robert Cummins (husband?); it was a good experience.,"Very fun and interesting class. Wished she would post notes online, but she certainly breaks it down in class in an engaging way that was able to keep my attention for most of the classes. Her exams are usually take home and more or less simple if you come to class and read the text. THe only cricism I have is her TA's do not know how to grade!",No Comments,"Prof: Intelligent, knows the material, funny, &amp; good-natured. Very good lecture presentation. Great in discussion w/students. Class: No online notes, so you'd best come to class! More info is to be had in lecture than from the texts (even split between hard text &amp; pdfs). Tests are take-home. Very interesting blend of psych., phil., &amp; ev. bio."
983006,2.0,Robert,Cummins,14,0.2611989607386155,"He seems like a nice guy, but he isn't the best teacher.  He never explained the grading policy, which still has me worried about my grade.  I learned a lot from him, but the class proved to be fairly stressful.  Not what I was hoping for, but still worth taking if you need a Philosophy class.","He doesn't care how his students are doing in class, and he seems to get upset when we ask questions. He's super one-sided, and doesn't really teach. He assumes we're all already on his level with philosophy, but most of us have never taken philosophy before.","Awful, awful, awful. Why is a Philosophy teacher teaching a 300 level psych class? He has no idea what he's talking about, rambles, and is extremely unclear. Can't answer simple questions, let alone teach.He's also a JERK: I joined the class late, and asked to make up the attendance points, he said no, it wasn't his fault I joined late. Avoid!!!","arguably the worst professor on this campus.  very closed minded, hard grader, does not explain information well.  you can try really hard to understand the random material, but he will test you on things he never discusses in class that have no connection to the subject matter.  worst experience i have had at this university.",I took this class with a open mind and coming out of it with Cummins as a professor made me feel like philosophy is the most useless subject on the planet.  He always strayed from the topic that he told you he was going to discuss and it was nearly impossible to make him happy on the essay questions.,He doesnt really teach... he just kind of rambles on for an hour and doesn't really care if you understand or not.,"Boring, pretentious, dry.  I couldn't stand this class. Material you learn is largely useless unless you want to want to become a philosopher (hilarious).  Most of the answers to the essay questions can be found online.  I hated the structure and presentation of his lecture slides; unclear and lacking in detail. Don't take 206 (or any philo class).","Extremely knowledgeable, knows what he's talking about, and makes lectures interesting by adding relating examples and factoids from all areas of life. I swear that man knows everything. Classes are mostly lecture, but he goes thru the reading so well that it becomes easy to understand.","He gave me an F for no reason at all. I tried to talk to him about it, and he was condescending and derived pleasure from distress. Overall, unnecessarily painful class and arrogant pathetic excuse for a professor.",Awful lecturer. The only reason I did well was because my TA in discussion was amazing and explained everything that Cummins attempted to. He was always off topic and I could never understand what he was talking about during lecture. I stopped going to lecture after the first couple weeks and still got a B+,"Awful lecturer, often strays WAY off subject. Makes the assumption that you already know concepts. I realized I didn't gain anything from lecture so stopped going. His lecture notes(powerpoints) are very easy to understand, and his 4 take home essays are actually easy. Overall, bad lecturer, but easy class if you just read his notes for the papers.","He just continues to talk about random subjects and you have no idea what is actually important.  I stopped going to class and for the essay, you could just reword his powerpoints.",He's very one sided. I had no idea what he was talking about most of the time and there was no textbook to go to for reference,"The class is interesting and WILL make you challenge your beliefs. The problem is that Dr. Cummins speaks as if you already knew most of what he's talking about. Also, the vocabulary he uses is beyond me, and I usually don't get the big idea. The redeeming thing is that the only assignments are 3 take home tests, none of which are unreasonable."
1753694,4.6,Desmond,Cummins,6,0.6400291656175587,"He started off being kind of bad at teaching, but he always strives to improve himself and let me say, he is a much better teacher than he was at the beginning of the semester. He's REALLY nice and he cares about his students a lot. Very reasonable person!","Desmond tries really hard to get the concepts across to us, and he even has some pretty good jokes.  Matrix Theory can be pretty counterintuitive, but he tries his best to simplify it and does a good job.  Very laid back and VERY easily approachable. Easy class overall and fair exams (basically like the HW problems he assigns which aren't too bad)","The most laid back professor you'll meet. He's entertaining, willing to help and an overall joy to learn from. Class feels like a break more than a lecture",Desmond is a good teacher. He made Calc 3 very enjoyable as well.,"Desmond is very solid TA, he is really helpful in explaining problems I have and is a pretty nice guy if you ever talk to him. He grades very reasonable and is very straight forward about what will be on his test and gives good study guides.","Best professor/TA I've ever had!! (Mathematica section taught by lead TA and other random ta's). He gave us study guides, held review sessions, and had no problem helping with coding problems in class! He is also super nice and sweet. Made calc 3 enjoyable!"

Just make sure to go to lectures.","There were several bumps in the road for new assignments, but overall, his lectures are some of the clearest out there with many detailed examples.","He is a SWEET AMAZING &amp; beyond AWESOME guy. He's one of those profs WHO CARE ABOUT TEACHING. He will repeat concepts, connect them to something relevant today, &amp; help you whenever you need it. MPs are not hard nor easy (which is great so you get to learn). He reviews topics b4 a semi pop quiz (warn in advance. 2 or 3 unless ppl skip lect). TAKE HIM","He is new to teaching this course. As a person, Ryan is a great guy. It seems like he wanted to do too much to overhaul the course and as a result, made the class significantly harder. He tries to make up for it in different ways. He is getting a feel for how to teach the class, so I believe he is worth giving a chance.","Ryan did make the class a bit harder, but it was manageable and worthwhile since we learned so much more.",The MP was annoying...made the class harder than anticipated,Seems to enjoy giving his students a hard time. Absolutely not recommended.,"The course use to be quite fun before, but he has made it harder, starting from the first MP itself he made it impossible."

Sometimes the homework for the class does not always seem to be relevant or can take a while, but Dr. Cunningham will make you interested in biosensors and happy to be there.",An effective teacher and speaker. Very amicable to students. The lecture materials are well-prepared and organized. Very bright and knowledgeable. The lecture slides are very good. I enjoyed taking his class and learned a lot.,"A little quirky, but a fun professor who really seems to enjoy teaching. His lectures and examples are clear and thorough and give you a good understanding of the material. I hardly ever needed to look in the book as long as paid attention during lecture.

1633191,4.2,Christopher,Cunningham,23,0.5780421673290688,"Prof. Cunningham is like being taught be a hyperactive dog. He is really enthusiastic so that maintains your attention. Still, he can go off on tangents, gets distracted by QUESTION! guy, and makes a lot of references I don't understand. Think Abed from community with ""Dean"" level enthusiasm. Hard to understand, but you can't help but like him.","I've never had a professor who went through such a wide range of emotions within one lecture. He's very energetic and clearly loves teaching and loves math. His examples aren't always clear but he's always willing to help out and he's extremely helpful in a 1 on 1 situation.I think he teaches somewhere else now, not sure how to update ratemyprof.","He uses slightly unorthodox methods of teaching, but is super committed to helping his students learn. Although challenging, I found that going to office hours regularly helped me do extremely well in the course (surprise, surprise!). ""QUESTION!""-guy was annoying, but oh well. I'd take another class with him for sure!","Wow, it's surprising to see so many positive comments here, but perhaps he is a good Calc I teacher, but holy hell is he a terrible Differential Equations teacher. The textbook was terrible, his teaching methods were terrible. He would constantly be interrupted by a kid shouting ""QUESTION!"" in class. His tests are *much* harder than what he teaches","Chris is an eccentric hyperactive man who clearly enjoys both math and teaching. One time in lecture we had a scavenger hunt. Another time he used cake as an example and everyone got cake.I found the workload and tests challenging but definitely doable, especially when I started going to office hours. I'm not a STEM major but I enjoyed this class.",Very Good Instructor Definitely Recommend Him,Funny guy. Great teacher. Explains EXTREMELY thoroughly. Definitely the best teacher I've had so far.,"Very strange person. Tries to be helpful and enthusiastic, but his examples are absolutely awful. His teachings of concepts are terrible. Thank god my TA was able to decipher what he was saying and relay it to me. I would advise getting out of his class.",He is a very good instructor who like teaching. He is very helpful and very open to questions. I recommend him,Outstanding teacher. He is enthusiastic and clear during his lectures. He makes the material easy to understand and the exams are very manageable. Definitely recommend him!,"Great teacher. He is humorous and always try to make the content easier. The examples are not ""strange"", just ""unusual"", and really helpful!",He is an adequate teacher. He uses very strange examples to explain things though. If possible I would get a different teacher who better teaches the basic concept.,"Very enthusiastic about teaching, his tests are hard but fair. Enjoy this class very much.","He's definitely my favorite professor this semester. I hate math but I love his class, and he loves teaching it so it makes it much more enjoyable. He jumps around and is kind of a goof, has some nerding out breaks where he mentions LoL but I love that!","Very energetic and lively, always helpful. Did a great job of making 8am lectures interesting. Allowed note-cards on exams, so this meant there was more to the course than just memorizing a bunch of rules.","A very chipper teacher. It helps a lot when you have to learn calc at 8AM every morning lol. He's very clear with directions and answers literally every question you have during lecture. ""Alright, good morning class!!"" *every one looks half-asleep* lol","good young professor,though his lecture sometimes not clear enough",He was really nice and very helpful but is the kind of guy that is really smart and isn't the best at dumbing it down for the the average student.

At the beginning class(101)seems easy, but when you get your first homework where you should write whole code by yourself , that's madness. However, midterms are not so bad , but the final is tough because there are free-response  questions.","Good teacher, but the homeworks are a little tough, especially if you are not a CS major. Would suggest utilizing TA office hours, and befriending people!",Very condescending. Answers Piazza posts in a very disrespectful way. Gets really mad when people don't attend lecture so he makes the tests really hard which doesn't benefit anyone.

Make sure you do the readings or else he will roast you.,"I used to think his lectures were boring but if you actually put effort into taking notes, you'll realize they're pretty helpful for essays. Oddly enough he seems to grade the take-home essays pretty generously but exam essays more harshly (at least in my and my friend's experience) so BE PREPARED for exams!","Horrid as 100 level prof. Assignment grades are based on participation and attendance, not the quality of the assignment itself. If you plagiarize, you will be allowed to redo the assignment for D; however, if you ""fail to answer the question"" (read your opinion differs from his) you will receive an F with no make up option. Do not take his classes","By far the worst teacher I have had in college. He's extremely inconsiderate, assigns astronomical amounts of reading,  and uses class as a chance to prove that he knows more than his students. Don't even bother answering his questions because even if your answer is flawless, he'll say you're wrong. Made me not want to be a history major anymore.",Middle Eastern History with Cuno was difficult but well worth the effort. Plenty of readings with discussions every week that really get you to think about what you've read. Paper topics are broad and easy to accomplish if you've done the reading. Cuno does a great job explaining complex topics and relating them to current events. Class act prof.,"attendance in this class is mandatory, but he does not tell you that it is. His essays are very vague topics and difficult to understand and when approached to ask about the essays, he does not help at all and then reprimands you and tells you to ""read the bloody prompt"" He changed the midterm two weeks before class ended .",This guy is not a nice person. He changed the syllabus mid semester (more like 2/3 the way thru) from a final paper over the last 1/3 of the class to a cumulative final in-class exam with 2 essays and 10 ID's. He won't hesitate to curse at you if you're not devoting your 100% attention to him. He seems to forget he's teaching a 100 level class.,"The class isn't too bad. The exams are all essays, that are pretty straight forward as long as you show up to class. The assigned textbooks are useless, his lectures do not go with them at all, so don't even bother buying them. The lectures themselves are boring and his power points have next to no info on them, so your forced to pay attention.","He appeared sincere though, at times slightly grumpy, and, all in all, I liked the class and the way it was structured. Someone mentioned however getting an 'A+' when in fact Dr. Cuno never gives more than an A. Brings to doubt the veracity of his/her other comments. As for Dr. Cuno, I would not really hesitate recommending him.",I am sorry but his class was bad..It was not easy to keep pace with so many assignments ... The material was not easy if you did not already know half the stuff while registering for class....And he seemed uninterested in his own class(!?!),"Articulate, intelligent, and professional, Cuno is an easy man to respect.  If you behave like an adult, complete all of the assignments (there are many), and do the important readings, you can get an A fairly easily.  There's a term paper, take-home midterm, and in-class final (essay).  Use his lecture outlines on COMPASS to study for the final.","This man is a legend. One of my favorite professors so far at college. Class is well structured, the material is interesting, and grading is fair. I got an A+, and didn't even buy any of the textbooks. Just go to lecture, and take good notes. And don't act up, this man knows how to put people in their place. He will do it, and it will be legendary.","Ok, first the pros.  Super easy class.  Easy exams, pop quizzes and little completion assignments along the way.  You must attend class cuz he gives pop quizzes. Info that could be interesting.  The cons?  SUPER BORING!!

He tends to be grumpy sometimes, and lecture is boring because he reads off a sheet.","Solid professor.  His lectures could be boring at times, but they were helpful.  He also posted notes of his lectures which helped with the papers and studying.  The homework was very easy and the papers and exams were fair.  If you put forth a reasonable amount of time and effort you should do just fine.","His lectures consist of cramming an hour and a half of information into a fifty minute class, and as a result he sped read most of the information, so it was slightly hard to take quality notes. He was very knowledegble and passionate about the subject, and the assignments were fairy graded. You didn't really need to read. All in all, he was decent","He is an honest grader. He may seem intimidating at times, but by far he is the best professor when it comes to Middle Eastern/Islamic studies.",by far the best teacher i've ever had!,"I would say this class had very little reading, especially for a history class.

Can go off track. Usually unclear of what is expected. Students tend to find her requirements and what she wants confusing.,"If you're sensitive to feedback, might not fit well, but her feedback and knowledge are good. Very unique personality. Can come off as abrupt and did ramble confusingly a few times in lecture. Had to get used to the style. Extremely interesting class, discussions, readings (lots), and topics. One of the most different &amp; interesting classes I've had","Please don't be swindled by the Disney tag. She means well and you will learn a lot of interesting stuff about Disney's darker past, but it basically ends there. Tedious and convoluted lectures every class. Doesn't value her students ideas unless they reflect her own, and will give you bad grades if your writing doesn't regurgitate her own opinions",I expected a fun class analyzing films but had to watch many of them on our own time on top of all the readings which were long film reviews. Quizzes were specific and essays were graded hard. Rubrics were pages long and hard to follow. I had to form a study group to pass. She also held us late because she talks so much had a lot of tech problems.,"Professor Curry is very quirky and initially I found the class to be rather boring. However, after about a month I began to really like her and actually enjoy the class as well. She does give a lot of readings and is hard on grading papers, however there was 2% of extra credit. Definitely a caring professor who is respectful of all minorities.","Prof. Curry is the worst, as a teacher and as a person. The class itself it pretty easy--just go to class and do the stupid assignments and you'll be fine. But she is so unpleasant that it makes the course hard to deal with. She's also a nightmare in terms of clarity--always make sure to ask her to clarify due dates and assignment instructions.","I do not recommend taking this class. She gives unreasonable amount of work for a 3 credit class. She also does not accept anyone's opinions but her own. We have up to 75 pages of reading in textbook a week, quizzes, film screenings and essays. The class is 3 credit hours but requires over 12 hours altogether to get a good grade.","she means well. if you just turn in the assignments on time and implant her suggestions into your work, then you'll be fine. if you're sensitive to criticism then don't take this class. possesses a large knowledge of film as an art that is rather refreshing.","I took ENGL 273 ""American Film Since 1950"" with Prof Curry in the spring of 2010. She was enthusiastic about film and gave engaging and thoughtful lectures. She has a high standard for written work but provides eager help with student's writing. Taking a course with Curry is an opportunity to improve one's writing gain enthusiasm for film","I had Professor Curry for English 300 in the spring of 2008 and absolutely loved her. She made class fun and interesting --even taught us how to write a screen play. She does challenge students, because students at U of I should be challenged. Don't expect her class to be a blow off, but expect to learn something.","Ramona Curry was literally the bane of my existence. She was an utterly horrible professor that was rude, wordy and unclear. If you take her class, you MUST write the papers how Ramona Curry would write them, not how you would write them - otherwise you'll do poorly. She spent hours teaching us grammar - in a 300 level class on Disney. STAY FAR AWA",She would email us the night before class with hundreds of pages of extra reading. In office hours she simply alternated between patronizing and insulting. She was so self interested that she couldn't recognize any of her students' writing or ideas as good-- and we were an honors class.  The class dropped from 30 to 15 within weeks.,She was an unhelpful teacher who just rambled to hear her own voice. It was a waste of time and I dreaded coming to class.,"What can I say about Prof. Curry.  She obviously loves what she teaches, so it's unfortunate that she is a completely horrendous teacher.  She is completely unclear in her assignments, and for a cross-listed ENGLISH class her writing style is confusing and far too wordy.  Also, she does not seem to understand that the syllabus is a CONTRACT.","If you want to experience the heaviness of grad work during Freshman year, take this class.  This Disney class, which I expected to be FUN and INTERESTING, was neither.  It practically ruined my first semester because of the workload.  Don't get sucked in by the Disney tagline.  I was and I regret it.  AVOID AT ALL COSTS.",Professor Curry's Disney class was more work than my other 4 classes combined.  Tons of reading from 4 different text books.  The syllabus is a solid 4 pages of incomprehensible rambling and it is hard to determine the gist of assignments most times. She is very knowledgable and willing to help.  Go to office hours!,"She is hard. She will challenge you to improve in all you do, because she truly cares. Some people must mistake challenging students for being a terrible teacher. She has so much to say, that sometimes you can't understand her rambling. MUST attend class and MUST attend film labs. She always makes herself available for extra help. GO TO OFFICE HOUR","I dont know where to start. She is the WORST teacher i have ever had in my entire life. I dread coming to class because she just talks for 3 hours.  Im in her Disney class-so i was SO excited, but all we do is analyze reviews. she rambles and is very wordy. if you  ask her one simple question, she will talk AT you for 20 min. DONT TAKE HER CLASSES!",I took a Disney class with Professor Curry and was sorely disappointed. Was the class easy? Yes. Was it interesting? Hardly. It's very hard to make a class interesting when the entire semester is spent reviewing the same concepts over and over again. Enough we get it... I think she truly underestimates undergraduates' ability to think and reason.,"Professor Curry seems tough at first, but the course is actually not too bad. We only had one midterm, a final, three small writing assignments, occasional quizzes, and weekly readings. She gives an extra credit oppurtunity too. The exams are essay exams and are a lot of writing, but you have the questions ahead of time."

Lectures are mostly disconnected from exam material. The extra credit opportunities are far and wide, with the same 2 or 3 students taking them repeatedly. He is charismatic, I guess.. Unfortunately, I would not recommend.","Sean is the best instructor I have had for French, and is possibly the best instructor I've had at UIUC. His #1 priority is helping you learn as much French as possible in a fun, low-stress way, and it works. I love learning French now, whereas it used to be just a language requirement.  That said, put in the work; he deserves it!","Take Sean Curtin for French, he is awesome. Gives TONS of extra credit opportunities and also answers questions during testsquizzes, as long as the questions are in French. Overall, very easy teacher and straight to the point. Really makes you understand French linguistically.","I took his French class at Illinois State University. Overall, I thought he was a good teacher. I learned more than I did in LAN 111.12, and I thought he structured the class well. Be prepared for lectures to be taught mostly in French. I thought he was kind of intimidating (initially) and a little rude at times, but he's got a sense of humor.","I had him as a French professor at Illinois State University. He was a fantastic teacher. He allowed questions to be asked during tests and quizzes as long as the questions were in French. He gave homework every night, but it was online and super easy. The tests and quizzes were short and easy also.","Sean is a great teacher whose extreme enthusiasm for his material will surely rub off on his students. This is a teacher who will go beyond to help his students succeed. Thus, if you attend classes and show your determination, he will help you score!"

She is a good lecturer and good at explaining definitions and math problems (tho she sometimes was off the track) But the only issue is that she forced you to do a random presentation during the class and you have to participate in order to get points from that.,"Horrible. Make one mistake on the exams, you get the whole section wrong. The total online quizzes had a class average of 66%. She gives you only 15 minutes to answer 5 tricky questions, and you can't skip or go back. It's ""you know it, or you don't."" Your best bet is to attend the TA discussions and form your own studying group!","Curtis is disorganized. Forgets to show up to the first lecture of the semester because she is ""preparing for class"". Tricky pop quizzes and won't provide answers to homework questions. Quizzes should be given after we learn the material not before. Take somewhere else.","Curtis gets a bad rep because she really doesn't make learning accounting fun. This class will destroy your gpa if you don't teach yourself the material and practice. I review a lot, used at the textbook a few times, but make sure you practice the PRACTICE EXAMS AND CLASS ACTIVITIES. The class isn't bad-- Susan's relentless off-tangent talking is","Knows her stuff but isn't always the best at showing it. Often goes off on tangents for up to twenty minutes, but is able to explain topics thoroughly when focused. Pre-quizzes were the hardest part of the class, so make sure you study beforehand. Class activities help a lot with studying so do them. Gives extra credit towards end of semester.","Susan is definitely not the best professor if you didn't take accounting in high school. The textbooks are expensive and useless, the lecture notebook is probably the best thing to get even though it is optional. Be prepared to work, go to office hours, and study every day if you didn't take accounting in high school.","She only teaches 20% of the time, but she does it really well. I did all the recommended practice problems, went to class, took notes, and did several practice exams before midterms and got an A+ in class. To do well in tests you have to understand accounting. This is where the practice problems and lectures helped me the most.",feel really bad for this course,"Prof Curtis is such a nice and lively person but I just cannot learn from her. The class has minimal structure, there are literally no resources to use on your own except the notes you take in class. Textbook doesn't help at all because it doesn't demonstrate any of the math problems, which is like all she tests on. Tests don't match lecture at all","Susan is a hard person to hate. Her energy and theatrics borderline on obnoxious, but you kind of just admire that part of her. She's really passionate about accounting, and will do everything possible to get you to understand the material (including singing, dancing, and rapping).","Susan Curtis tells a lot of stories during lecture, which isn't  necessarily a bad thing, but it distracts from actually getting students to understand material. Online Mini-Tests are given, and you never know if you're getting questions wrong because you're completely wrong or because of calculator rounding errors. It doesn't show the right answer","Very much a weed-out class. The professor allocates time poorly, often going off on tangents more appropriate for office hours than during a lecture where direct class material should be covered. Discussion sessions are the real chance to learn, and I am noticing the holes in my foundation while taking 202. Concepts are simple, delivery is weak.","If you want help, go find TAs. The professor only go through stuff on PPT, which are already posted on Compass. Things are easy but really need practice. The class is really ""optional"" as long as you attend her ""extra credit"" sections to get the points. Her ""extra credit"" means mandatory attendance.","Dr. Curtis is an amiable personality, who engages with the students. I only wish that the way she graded was no so heavy on the midterms and that her lectures were more in sink with exam content.","Curtis's lectures are funny and entertaining but she spends SO much time talking about unnecessary things. Everything she covers is online. The exams are easy and the final is optional. I made the mistake of buying the textsbooks, the only one your will use is are the lecture note books, never even opened the other two.",Probably the easiest accy class in the department. I only went to class when she announced there are extra credit opportunity and studied all the materials myself at home. It was an easy A if you go through the past exam and make sure you know how to prepare all the financial statements.  And do go to lecture during the Halloween!,She is funny. Amazing lecturer only because her lecture is kind of a relax for me. Only thing I learnt from her is just debits on the left and credits on he right. Be really excite about her costumes during Halloween as well. The course changed a lot after I took it. She added pop quizzes so not sure about the class material right now.,"Curtis does a good job teaching a challenging class. Fail one exam, you fail the class. The generic rubric is 50% for Exam 1 and 50% for Exam 2. Curtis posts slides online that contain what is taught in lecture. I would recommend discussion as the TA's are very helpful. She does provide a 40%, 40%, 20% (optional points) grading option too.","Only two midterms throughout the semester (Spring 2016) worth 200 points each. No other way to gain points. Fail one exam and you fail the entire course. Nice person, but horrible professor and has an even worse system of grading. Take at community college if you don't want to risk plumeting your GPA.","This class definitely is not easy. Considered the ""weed out"" class for students wanting to study Accounting. If you put in the work and go to her office hours though it is very possible to get an A. Work hard from the beginning if you want to do well."

Also, sit at the front of the class to hear him. Polite and smiling person. Makes tests too hard. Might give retests as a chance to improve grades on exams. Gets confused very easily.

He lectures very well, but one thing I noticed him do is make unnecessary complex variables excursions.","Prof. D'Angelo is definitely dedicated at teaching. Those who complain don't put the efforts he expects. He is very knowledgable in different areas of mathematics so if you are a math major or really intersted in math not just grades, you should take his class. Lectures and notes are very inspiring by combining different topics.",He is a very good teacher. Makes tough subjects easy.  He is insprirational. I feel lucky to get a change to listen lecture from him.,"He is an interesting guy, but definitely not a good professor for average students. If you are very enthusiastic about mathematics then he's your guy. But if you are taking classes just to graduate hoping to have a good GPA, then don't take any course with him.","He often makes offensive, off-topic comments during lecture, especially directed at Asian students. He is willing to help you, but make sure you don't mind being talked down to or yelled at when you go in to office hours.","He's ok, but definitely could improve his teaching style. Kind of arrogant, but not too hard to tolerate. For this class he tries to assign hard problems, but doesn't prepare us well for the types of questions that will be on the test. During his tests, he doesn't give enough time to finish. I wouldn't endorse him, but I wouldn't say avoid him.","The course is based on Fourier analysis and Hiltbert space.Good mathematician, interesting lectures, but definitely not easy, since some content of this course is graduate-level. The course of this course is to push you thinking and help you become a good geometry-intuitive thinker. Great course","He is very smart, very dedicated to math, and tries really hard to help his students. However, his lectures were very disorganized, he spoke too fast, and often came off as arrogant. He would ask if the class understood, but he was so unapproachable that no one said anything even if it was unclear. Interesting guy, not that good of a teacher.","He is very hard to understand because he expects you to do lots of outside reading. If he does not hear feedback, he will assume you understand. Definitely not easy, but always willing to help you outside of class.","He's the worst professor I ever met in my life! Coz he is also the author of the book which we use in the class, he talk a lot about about he he found those problem and etc. His lecture is really unorganized and he's sometimes rude and arrogant. I will try my best to avoid his class","He's an interesting guy... I can see why people wouldn't like him but I had no problem with him. If you understand the material, you'll have no problems with him. The tests are fair, though he doesn't give much partial credit. Our first test was ""really difficult"" (according to him)and I got an 84. He lightened up the next test and I got a 100.",Great man.  He really wants you to succeed at a level that corresponds to the ranking U of I has for math.  It is a tough course and you will need to put in the time but he is very very fair!,"worst professor I have ever had. He is not approachable, can be rude and makes the tests impossible by giving minimal partial credit. teaches so quickly that you can't even follow. DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS IF POSSIBLE!!!!",He is too hard on students. He does not give partial credit. Try to avoid having him as a professor.,Really intelligent and interested in what he teaches,He is a terribly selfish person.  Completely self-absorbed.  Thinks the students should be able to understand the material as well as he does although he has been doing it for 30 years.  Don't take him unless you want to have a bad semester.,"Inconsistent lecturer - sometimes he'll make sense, sometimes he'll go much too fast. He expects a lot from students, and comes off as condescending as a result - pretty much says every example is ""elementary"" and ""obvious,"" when most of the class doesn't know what's going on.","Tough teacher, but extremely well organised. Notes follow logical pattern from one topic to the next. Exams very challenging, expect to put in a lot of outside class time. I had the honor section, very demanding. Didn't fail anyone and very understanding of different students strengths and weaknesses, and very approachable for help.",No Comments,I took 243 in spring 05 and 415H in spring 06.

I learned a lot from this class and it was very useful for my internship.,"Dave was funny and sarcastic, but not the best teacher. He moves VERY quickly and its hard to keep up during lectures. Lectures were really long also, and my notes were unorganized. I had no idea what I was doing most of the time, but exams were pretty easy. The class is called Biostatistics, but they were barely related.","The homework is every week basically and easier than in his 400 class. His explanations were clear. He helps you out as much as you want since not many go to his office the day or two after homework is due.  Tests are similar.  He also introduced me to R markdown, different applications in R and usage of different packages -  Golden resource","Good professor! Homurous ! I think almost everyone gets at least an ""A-"" .","Easy A.  Show up to lecture and he'll give you the test problems but with different numbers, for practice.  Funny lecturer, though he makes many snide comments about random things that he seems to be strangely ardent about.  God bless this man",I love this guy. Had him for 400 and 420--definitely take his classes!,"The good news and bad news about this class: the homework  As long as you had put the time in for the homework (which are lengthy), you'll do well on the tests.  The margin of error out of 400 was not much at all, but  even so, you learn even if lecture would end up being a snooze.   Very kind person, funny lecturer.  Textbook not needed.",Professor Dalpiaz is one of the best professors I have ever had at U of I.  If you regularly attend lecture and discussion and diligently do the homework you can easily get an A (though nearly half the class never goes).  His office hours are great for getting homework help or simply just shooting the breeze.  I'd definitely recommend him.,"Helpful, engaging, patient, and enjoyable professor. He even answered my questions via email the day of an exam. Homework is straightforward and helps to nail down understanding of the material. Lectures are always focused but somehow fun and enjoyable. His notes are helpful. He provides a free electronic version of the textbook for all students!",One of the most useful classes I've taken! It helps that the class wasn't terribly difficult and he was very clear with his expectations.,"Probably one of the best professors at U of I.

Guy's stay away from this clas","She is a very cool young teacher. Class is not mandatory but you can fall behind a little if you don't go. No exams just several 2-4 page papers and a 5 and a 10 page paper. All her papers can be revised.

The homework assignments themselves are long and take a lot of time which turns a lot of people off from this class. Its really the nature of the material not the professor. If you work hard in his class you can learn a lot and get an A.","That class was a nightmare. Professor does NOT explain material during lecture, instead he prefers to have students work on worksheets. You will have an in class quiz every two weeks which has around 7-9 multiple choice questions, which means no partial credit. Final was at a higher difficulty level than the quizzes. Avoid at all costs.","Lectures are only discussions. All lectures are mandatory participation. Homeworks are very difficult. Quizzes are extremely easy for the first 3, and extremely difficult for the last 4. Final is hard.","TAM 598 - Computational Nonlinear Dynamics Entire class was math theory and learning his matlab program that I'll never use in my professional career, did not do a single dynamics problem the entire semester.

His exams are not relevant to the course material, no solutions for homework is ever given (homework is extremely difficult). Overall I still have no clue what the class was about after putting forth the majority of my study time for this class.","Prof. expects a level of math competence that is simply unrealistic. While brilliant, he does not share any thought patterns with the engineers in his classroom, which makes lectures completely useless. He provides supplementary content, but attaining the level of mathematical expertise necessary isn't possible while taking other classes.","I've never seen a professor so polished and organized, yet still so awful at teaching. DO NOT TAKE HIM, but if you do: You will put in no less than 8 hrs per week on homework(with TA help) with nothing to show, get asked test questions that will blindside you, and in the end learn absolutely nothing.  You have been warned. Makes 340 awful.",Homework is so long and hard that in order to finish it you must take it to office hours to get some help. Even then the TA's have no clue. There are no solutions posted so you don't know if you ever do anything right. The test averages are artificially inflated. Just an  all around awful teacher for an already hard class.,"For all those who must take me 340, DO NOT take it with this professor. His notes are confusing and useless, he has no practice tests or even homework solutions, just ""hints"". The homework is long, impossible and relates to the exam in absolutely no way shape or form. he gives exams with 150 points you have no hope of answering in 50 minutes..","Dear God, do not take this class if possible. The concepts are buried in mountains of unnecessary math, the homework and quizzes do not help you study for the tests, no homework solutions are given, the homework takes forever, and the lecture notes have no clearly-stated goals: just do what they say for no reason.","Incredibly Smart. Terrible Teacher. I hope nobody else has to go through the way he taught 340. Notes are confusing and inconsistent, Ridiculous amounts of useless homework, no solutions or practice tests. If you talk about how you are struggling in the class we will just make you feel stupid and insinuate you're not smart enough for Engineering","His course is a bit difficult, but interesting. Highly recommended.",He is a genius.,"A horrible advisor.  Does not know anything about the required or technical classes needed for ME.

Professor Dann is a great teacher who really knows his stuff. It is academically challenging but worth it. I had the class in the spring and would totally take one of his courses again.,"Dr. Dann is a really easygoing professor. He tries to teach the class in a broad sense without putting too much emphasis on the little details. His grading criteria for the two papers are relatively simple. If you write a solid paper and show you've done the work, you'll get an A. Very accessible and willing to clarify with students. A solid choice","If you are very interested in the Qur'an and Islam, then I would definitely take this class. It will really make you think deeply about not just Islam, but religion as a whole.

AVOID HIM!!!","This guy is a horrible teacher. Check out his ratings on Eastern Il, it's where he's from. Does not teach a single thing.

He wasn't the best lecturer and sometimes fumbled, but I'm chocking that up to it being his first semester teaching the class (Fall 2016). Tests were memorization heavy, but reading research papers and the group project taught me a lot.",Like MCB 150 will be a lot of info. Unlike MCB 150 will not be organized and will not tell you what to focus on. I say just record his lectures and try to memorize as much as possible. Homework is easy and once you know how to do it will take an hour at most.,"It's not that he's a bad teacher, he's just not very engaging. He's definitely knowledgeable and passionate about bioengineering, but lectures tend to be a lot of him reading off the slides and students dozing off. Tests require massive amounts of memorization and regurgitation.","He is new and has a lot of potential. The class itself covers so much material that it's hard to get into all of it in detail so sometimes he solely reads directly off the power points. However if you need help with some concepts he will explain it in detail to you, you just need to ask."

His exams and homeworks are a little hard, but he gives you plenty of chances to balance that with your lab grade and an extra credit video.

But the homework is very confusing &amp; you have to spend hrs analyzing every inch of the slides to complete them. Exams are in-depth but fair. Study hard.","My favorite professor and class at UIUC. Truly caring. His class was difficult but fun, and I imagine it's what econ grad school feels like. The models can get really complicated, but if you take the time to understand them, you'll be a better economist for it.","He goes through the models in a lot of detail but points out what the innovation of each paper has been which keeps the classes interesting. In the end, we were required to write two referee reports and research proposal to test our own imagination and research capability.","Professor Das' ECON490 - War, Terrorism, and Conflict was a really great class.  Gives a break-neck overview of tons of econ work related to those topics. The lectures can be dry as he goes into the math behind each model, but to not do so is a disservice to the aspiring economist.  Truly cares about the material and his students.  Highly recommend"

I took this class for his strictness, never have I learned so much. Would suggest for anyone not afraid to be challenged!","Dash is a HORRIBLE professor. Don't expect any help with your writing, any comments on any stories, or any compassion towards students in general. He asks his students to do an insane amount of work and gives  nothing in return. On top of that, he is rude, arrogant, and seems to enjoy embarrassing his students. Get another lab teacher if you can.","He spoke in my Journ 200 class and was very interesting, but did seem a little rude.

The in class final exam is hard with average of 55% but don't worry since your grade is based on the whole class performance-big curve.,He tries very hard to make his questions very hard to the point that they fall on being ridiculous and incomprehensible at times. If it wasn't because of the TA's explanations a lot of us would be lost.,"Material was very difficult. He does a decent job explaining, but you need to take very good notes to do the homework. The hardest part was trying to figure out what questions would be on the tests and homework.","The material for this class is very challenging. However, if you don't miss a class, pay attention and take good notes you will be fine (that was my approach to the class I got an A+). He always changes the way he distributes the grade, so he may have a final next year who knows.","This is not an easy class as far as the course material goes... but it definitely is an easy class if all you want is a good grade. There's no final, only 3 exams, one of which is take-home. Just make sure you go to the TAs and get all hw questions right. Do projects and use iclicker during class and u'll be fine","Very entertaining class, lectures are always exciting &amp; guest lecturers come almost every week.",Great class and teacher.

His tests are hard and the material on them was based off of something he discussed in 20 minutes of one lecture. He assigns ""blogs"" without clear instructions. Worst of all he uses big words and expects us to already know about things he talks about. Lectures are messy and confusing. My worst class so far!"

The class itself was not too hard, just do the study guides she gives for tests and you should be fine.","I was really excited going into this class but unfortunately Dr. Davis made this class almost unbearable. She was extremely spacey and never answered your questions completely. Class discussions were very repetitive. However, she did offer you some insight to cultural anthropology.

I also find it funny that someone said that it is hard to have a debate with her because students in the class conduct debates and she addresses both sides equally in my opinion.,"Quite possibly the worst teacher at UIUC. She is biased, uneducated and stubborn. The chances of having an intellectual debate with this woman are slim to none and she makes copious amounts of claims that aren't backed by data.

She really enjoys teaching about Native American cultures and I felt like I learned a lot that I didn't know! It was completely worth it even though I hate morning classes.,"I took this class for gen-ed, but it turned out to be my favorite class I've taken so far. She really knows her stuff and seems to really care about how students do in the class. Do the readings or the exams will be a LOT of work. This class should be required for all students at UIUC.","Even though attendance is mandatory and we read A LOT of books, I love Jenny! She is an awesome professor. She is understanding and really cares about her students. No exams, just 6 reading responses on the books we read and a final research paper on a topic you choose that has to do with the course. I have yet to actually read a book though.","The course has a lot of readings, however the tests are not as difficult as anyone may imagine as long as you get what the authors try to say in their reading.

Prof. Davis does go a bit fast in the lectures but the resources that come with this class are more than enough to grasp introductory knowledge of programming,","Homework is nearly impossible. Having him for your first coding class ever is not advisable. He lectures to several hundreds of students and doesn't spend enough time on the basics. The tests, homeworks, and labs are all nearly impossible next to what is covered in lecture","Professor is nice and the class is easy, the instructions are very clear and help is accessible. It is a great class to begin with if you have no prior experience with CS. That being said, if you have programmed a little bit before, there is very little to be learned in this class and your time would be better spend taking CS105 or CS125 instead.","Professor Davis makes CS101 fun and the class is hilariously easy. This isn't a bad thing - if you try, you do well. The TAs and CAs in lab will help you through everything and the homeworks are largely solvable with ease if you work in a small group. Prof. Davis also drops a lot of stuff, so your worst grades won't matter. Lots of extra credit.","Prof. Davis would sometimes give homeworks and tests that were way too hard for a 100-level class, (for example, one hw had an average of 61%, and one test average of 26%). However, he drops a couple homeworks/labs/tests so it isn't too hard to get a decent grade.",Great professor. Would come to lecture just to see his outfit. Very clear. Very approachable.,"Super nice teacher, but messed up the first tests of the semester while using a new testing method. The first two tests were too hard for an introductory class. On the flip side, he was very proactive in solving this problem and curving it to an acceptable level. Other than that, he's super knowledgeable, gives extra credit, and is very available.","Knows his stuff. He listens to students, wants feedback on how the class is going. He gives good feedback. Lecture provided lots of info so attend, but slides are uploaded later. Labs and homework were kinda difficult towards the second half of the semester, make a friend in lab who's smarter than you and you should be fine.","The class is hard for me who never code before. Just do the practice midterm and final, you'll be fine.","Has a deep understanding of programming. His class was very well structured. Each lecture was seemingly well-prepared with helpful examples, and slides were available for review. He's an approachable guy, but lectures were usually all business.

By far one of the best profs in Human Kinetics and he was new this year.

I enjoyed the class material sometimes but some lectures taught by TAs are much more interesting than the professor's lecture. 4 small assignments and two papers, and the exam is easy. No need to do the reading or go to lecture. If you are not really into music, don't take this class.",I am a non-music major. Easy class. Very interesting. Young professor who is very funny with lots of energy. You don't really need to go to lecture b/c he posts the slides on compass. Easy assignments which are worth most of your grade. One midterm and one final! I recommend this class! I learned a lot.

She hates people who talks in her class and treats them terribly. you have to write an essay every week and there is a final paper about 7 pages. you have to be exactly on time to class or else you miss your  attendance points. some people like her, some people hated her","Amy has strict rules and high standards. With that being said, this was my favorite class of the semester. The course required as much work as a 300 level class should. The content is interesting and Amy is more than willing to help if you put in the effort. Start early on the workshop and go to class. I did and got a 97..","Overall the class interesting, she tends to use videoclips and iclicker surveys to keep it interesting. However she is pretty strict and not flexible with deadlines. Also this class requires online discussions every week which can be redundant and very annoying. There is no book but a lot of online reading. Tests are easy, GO TO THE REVIEW SESSIONS","This class was semi-difficult. Amy was very strict and did not seem to care what any students thought about the class. Then again, this was a lecture with 300 people so I don?t blame her. If you put the time into the class, the material and lectures are interesting. Be prepared for many, many readings.","Yeah, Amy is tough, but that also means she is fair. She has strict policies, but there is probably a reason for them. The posts we do are interesting and even though they take up time, we only meet in lecture twice a week, so it isn't too bad. Even if she isn't the easiest person to get along with, she does try to give students a lot of help.",Amy requires a ton of work. No textbook but many readings which become iclicker Qs. Exams are difficult and a bit tricky. I like the material but Amy can be very hard to get along with. 500w discussion post to compass each week with 5 responses: mandatory.,"She is a challenging professor, but you learn a lot, and she makes the material interesting (like watching clips). She keeps to her rules about deadlines, etc., which I appreciate so some jerk doesn't get an extension when I turned my work in on time. She has helped me more than onece with my work. She is a great teacher - I totally recommend her!"

So do it.","Must attend every lecture and do every reading (usually about 100 pages per week) in order to get good pop quiz grade (attendance grade).  Very unfair grading, no matter how much you study for the midterm and final an A is pretty much impossible.  Hard to get in touch with..impossible.  Don't recommend this class.","Now that Jose is the professor, it is difficult to receive an A. There was too much information to cover. Lecture notes must be memorized, and one must be able to retrace all the stories ( it is not know what's on the exam) in a fair amount of detail. This course will have you read 600-700 pages of the textbook and additional readings in total.","Jose is a great professor and man. His lectures are interesting and he seems to really care about what he is talking about. English is not his native language, but it is not hard to understand him. He openly said that he wants to give you an A in the class. If you deserve one you'll get one. It's not a blowoff, but it's worth two gen eds.","now that hes an actual professor hes HORRIBLE. there is an insane amount of lecture notes, randomly graded pop quizzes during a lecture of 300, and only two tests-midterm and final. the amount of information you have to know is ridiculous. one of the worst teachers ive ever had.","""If you deserve A, you get A.

Not only did she switch our class mid semester from Native American Studies to just Guam Islander because she's from Guam, but we only had one test and it was almost impossible. Everyone in my class got lower than a C. The readings are pretty interesting, but she seems unprepared most of the time.","Very interesting lectures and videos in class are good.

He is knowledgeable in his field and he always makes class interactive. However, without going for lecture, his slides will be very difficult to understand. The exams are hard but they are curved heavily (19/31A)",Posts the slides online but you have to go to class in order to understand the concepts fully. 3 exams that are application-based so you have to really know the material. Made lectures fun and interesting and sometimes would get off topic but would keep the class engaged with his humor. Unique grading scale!,"Gary gives some tough tests, but the curves are insane. For the first test, 19 out of 31 questions right is an A grade. Great professor though, everything presented is with examples and is crystal clear. No homework, 3 exams, don't have to spend that much time for the course.","I took an Intro to Cognitive Science class with Dr. Dell a long time ago. His lectures were well-prepared, engaging, and had great slides. Tests were easy if you pay attention. He inspired me to go into the field. I was a TA as an undergraduate - a great experience.  His letter of recommendation got me into a Stanford PhD program.","One of the best professors that I had in university. Also, one of the easiest class! I don't understand other people down here. At a college level course, very clear, and very understandable! If you go lectures, and pay attention, A is waiting for you.","Gary is awesome! He's really funny (in a bizarre way) and tries to make the material as interesting and understandable as possible. I'm not sure why the past reviewers said that his tests were hard. Sure, you may get a 20/31 but that still is an A. Seriously this is one of the easiest classes I ever took! You don't always need to go to class either","very funny and nice guy. the material is really challenging and he tries to explain it well, but its not enough. you have to read the book but the book is impossible to understand. exams are very hard but they're curved. he was one of my favorite professors","Professor Dell tries to teach effectively, but he spends far too much time on case studies and far too little time on explanations, book material, etc. Every lecture feels like nothing more than us being shown the methods and results of psychological studies conducted. The dated text book is also of dubious relevance.","Before this class I thought I wanted to major in psych, however between the boring lectures, strange grading scale, and ridiculous tests I have changed my mind. The book is not necessary, but going to class is if you want to understand his random lecture slides which even as he explains them many times make no sense. Nice guy, terrible class.","Yes his slides are random and you will benefit from going to lecture - but you can also miss class randomly and be fine. I never opened the book, still got a good grade. He's adorable when he tries to make jokes. Tests are hard but he curves them.",The lectures are boring. His lecture slides are ambiguous. And the class overall is not worth the time or the money in my opinion.  The book (dated 1991) is mostly irrelevant to the lectures.,"He was so great!! One of the best Psyc professors in my opinion. He is so knowledgeable and makes the lectures interesting. He makes the exams hard but puts HUGE curves on them where 19/31 is an A. The book is hard to understand,Ii didnt even buy it and i ended up with an A in the class. I recommend him! He's really nice!","Professor Dell is fair. The exams are not easy, but there is a very large curve. Though attendance is NOT mandatory, you really need to go because the powerpoints are difficult to follow without his explanation of them. I never read the text book once and still got an A, just going to every lecture.","Very funny prof. Explains material well. Easy A if you actually try. Class slides do not make sense unless you go to class and pay attention and add notes to them. Study and memorize the notes for the exams. Do the extra credit (easy experiments like in early psych classes) to be safe! The final is optional, which is nice!",Overall Gary Dell was a really nice professor.  Laid back with a lot of good stories.  We even got to VOTE the first day on whether or not we wanted to use the plus/minus scale for grades.  Seemed really easy to talk to too.,EASY EASY class- but almost all the psych classes are.  NO need to read the book- i went to class almost everyday but slept through half of it- i would study the powerpoints from lecture the night before the test and i ended up with an A.  Not much effort needed- just go to class and listen. Then review stuff before the test.  A for sure.,"Hard exams, but huge curve. Yet you still need to study. Make sure to go to class because his powerpoint slides are crazy ambiguous and majority of exams are based off of his notes. START OFF STRONG - he has an optional 4th exam in case you are on the border, but you dont need to take it if you already have a good grade.",prof. dell is a nice guy but his teaching is kind of flawed. the pwpts are definitely ambiguous and his examples arent always easy to apply to the topic. his tests are hard but he curves a lot. study the experiments and learn how to apply the concepts. don't memorize names or dates.,"Are you all CRAZY?! Gary Dell was the absolute WORST professor that I've ever had. He went off on tangents that were completely ridiculous, his PowerPoint lectures were impossible to follow with diagrams of who knows what, and he was in no way funny. It is impossible to study for the exams because he teaches different from the text book!","Learning and Memory was a fun class :) The material was always interesting. The tests were really hard, but he curved them a lot. If you memorize everything and all the experiments, you'll do well.

You have to stay on top of it all semester. 3 hour exams weren't bad, but the cumulative final was brutal &amp; was worth 25% of your grade. Demarco was really good at explaining the material &amp; enjoyed answering q's.  Much more interesting than 101, but prepare to spend lots of time studying.","Do not expect this to be an easy class. The material is difficult and you go through a lot very quickly. But he is a good professor who takes his time to explain things. Go to every lecture, book is not necessary, and buy the slideshow packet; everything is in there and otherwise it's impossible to take notes. Really stay on top of this class.",Theres a reason why the former professor of this class gave extra credit like crazy. Its a very tough class for something thats supposed to be rudimentary physics for non-majors. Demarco just made the class even more ridiculously tough. Don't take this course choose another class.

I had never taken physics before this and went in with next to no interest, but I was actually sad when the semester was over!  Prof Demarco does a great job of keeping lectures interesting and really relating concepts to every day life.  If there was another course like this I would take it as an elective!!!","You dont need the textbook. If you've taken physics, this is an interesting class. Disc. Room is easy!!!! Use previous tests to study. Tests can be tricky w/ new and unseen q's. Go to class, b/c you learn alot about everyday things. He's easy to understand. Book not needed!!! Save the money... answers to HW in lectures basically!!!!","Not my favorite class ever. Note taking wasn't possible and a lot of the demos were unreasonable and didn't pertain to or help with the subject. Kind of arrogant.

Take it, but don't expect to love it.","He is a really awesome teacher, his lectures are really entertaining.  He is always doing cool demos.  The tests can be kind of difficult, however if you read the book you will do fine.  I really recommend this class, i enjoyed and i hate science","I never took physics before so the class was a challenge.  But, since most people have just go to lecture and enjoy his demos.

Tests can be tough but if you prepare well you will be fine! Find friends to check over the homework with (you're bound to know at least 5 other people taking the class.)","This class is a dream for nonscience majors. Although its not a blowoff class, it is low-maitenance.

I had her for my first semester of Italian and she expects you to know to much for your first semester ever. Do not reccomend her. She will call on you and if you do not know the answer, wil wait for you to figure it out, which can be a HUGE problem for Italian",This class was ridiculous. She assigned 2 papers for the entire course- both of which were about 10 pages long. The major problem? The questions asked for the paper were INSANELY unclear. This WOMAN was unclear about EVERYTHING. I HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend anyone NOT to take this class EVER.,"She has a heavy accent, which makes it hard to understand sometimes.

The lectures sometimes become too much because she talks very fast but she is also very clear, precise and will answer all your questions to maximum details. She knows what she is teaching and is passionate about it. Tests are a little difficult but its not an issue if show up to class and listen once in a while.","A solid class where you can learn a lot without being overwhelmed. Still being modified each term so it may be different next semester, but 50% of the grade is a term paper you work on throughout the semester (not as scary as it sounds, there's lots of flexibility on topic). And she's WICKED funny, oh my goodness.","Very clear lecturer, and very fair and clearly written tests. I personally didn't find her sense of humor all that great, but she was a generally a very knowledgeable professor and good lecturer.","If you skip, you will surely miss things that are on the exam. This class isn't an easy A, but if you study, an A is definitely possible.  Her tests consist of application questions, so make sure you know the information on the study guide. I thought lectures were boring, but she provides all of the information for the exams.",A really great lecturer.  The class was interesting and prepared you well for the tests.  It was easy to do well if you paid attention in class.,"Great lecturer, nice/funny person, makes the material interesting. Posts slides online, but GO TO LECTURE because there's material she discusses not in the slides that will be on the exam.  Exams are tricky, so use the study guides she gives. I got As and Bs with a decent amount of studying, so it's not too tough. Just not an easy A. Fun class!","This class was great. She was very knowledgable of the topic and she made it interesting. There was a lot of reading and a long paper but she broke it up well. Overall, I loved this class.","Jaime is knowledgeable and funny. This was the pilot of this class and it was well - structured with a midterm, final paper, discussion question submission and attendance points. There's a lot of reading primary lit for behavior genetics but it's worth it.","Extremely helpful, always clear with her points and humorous. Makes an hour and 20 minute class go by pretty fast, always left feeling I had learned something that day.","She is awesome! She's hilarious without really trying. She knows exactly what she is talking about and is SO educated in her field. Easy to listen to because she is very personable. The class is a bit on the tougher side but super interesting, definitely take this class!"

Too unfortunate that a bright mind like hers, product of Berkeley and MIT cannot teach students. No incentive to sit through her class as she reads out slides and expects everyone to be on the same page. When contacted outside class, she is not particularly helpful. Unfortunately, it is a compulsory course","Honestly, I dislike the professor's teaching style which makes my mind wandering most of the time in class. Good news is that you could self-study because lecture notes are very clear and understandable.","Professor Tatyana, although extremely knowledgeable, is unfortunately not the best at teaching. Her lectures are dry, and PPT heavy. Her assignments are long and are weekly. Exams are extremely difficult and is a tough grader. We even have assignment submissions and exams on the same days.

You have to do some good reading in her class and if you show effort you will be fine.  I'm shocked to hear so much negative about Manisha.  I took 2 classes with her in Switzerland and she was not only a great professor but also went about and beyond to make sure that we were all enjoyed our time.,"I hated this class. Worst class and professor I've ever had. She was pathetic. I got a C+ in the class. I'm now a senior with a 3.92 GPA. This class is the one blemish on my record. Funny I have a 3.92, but couldn't muster more than a C+ in this class! horrible horrible experience.",Please don't take a class with her. Avoid her if you can.

She asks that students learn her opinion, instead of those that the assigned readings convey.",This teacher just makes things more confusing...and often contradicts herself.,"Want to debate? That's great, as long as your opinion matches hers. A fan of fractured english? That's even better! You'll see plenty of it on her poorly written quizzes.",The class has absolutely no focus and is a waste of my time.,"This class is completely ridiculous. There is no order to the class, the notes she offers rarely correlate with her lectures and the readings are entirely too long and don't always relate. She teaches the class as if it had 15 students in it as opposed to the 200+ that there really are, looking for discussions and debates. I've learned nothing.","This was by far the worst class I have taken here in my three years.  I have never found a class to be so unstructured and so confusing.  We did a group project and in a class of 300 or so, she decides to read off the groups for about a good half hour.  She may be perfectly nice (which I am unsure of) but she does not know how to run a big class.","Didn't help me at all, and was NOT easy to understand.","The ratings sound harsh, but this class really is not very good. AT ALL. I always left class wondering what we were supposed to know. The many pop quizzes asked very detailed questions. Even if you do the reading, you might not do well on these. Also, the midterm and final were kind of based on opinion, making it hard to study for.","Miserable class.  Teacher makes unabashed biased remarks and has no tolerance for competing ideas.  Conservatives especially beware.  Simply put, do not take this class.","DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS I REPEAT DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS",Absolute idiot.  If you respond to one of her questions in a way that she disagrees with she dismisses it.  makes general and not always factual statements.  Can't speak english.  Blabs on and on about nothing.  hypocrite.  Don't take her class.,"All we do is read enourmously large articles about nothing.  Maybe one point in the entire article relates to the class. very stupid.  She didn't attend class for two weeks and failed to get a sub, so she left it up to the TA's and all they could do was show movies.  Then we took a midterm over, nothing. it sucked. not a fan at all.",It would be nice if she came to class or made sure the movies work (the ones she gave the TAs because she wasnt going to show up)... Midterm is coming up and i feel like i havent learned anything that i could possibly be tested on...and everyday we read redundant packets that are longer than most books i read,"Stay away from this class. The only good thing was that it fulfilled a gened, otherwise it was a complete waste of time. she showed up when she wanted, sometimes had the TAs show videos when she didn't come to class, made us do ridiculous 'group work' in a lecture of 200 people, yelled at people for getting up to go to the bathroom, i hated her."

PhD with no teaching ability,"Impatient and not helpful. He makes a lot of mistakes whiling teaching, not by accident. Instead, he misunderstands many of the concepts, but he thinks he is always right. He would act as being strongly offended if his students point out his mistakes, or even just ask him to clarify something, so it is impossible to argue or discuss with him.","Prof Dey is one of the hardest working teachers on campus. He loves finance and wants to see is students do well. Although he may not be that clear, he is more than willing to take extra time in private to explain it to you.",Very Poor English.

Industry leader interviews are extremely interesting and enlightening. Well worth taking.,Prof. Dig teaches really well.

Attendance was not mandatory for lectures but, you will not understand the material in discussions or during exams if you don't go. The optional workbook is an absolute lifesaver and definitely worth the money. The workbook has three practice exams for each test and are very similar to the ones he'll give you.","DiIanni is awesome. He makes the material very easy to understand and provides tons of examples. As long as you attend lectures and do the practice problems, you'll be fine. I have heard for this class, though, Vazquez is much much easier but DiIanni is a better teacher. I would definitely take this class with him again.",Easy class! Exams are simple if you retake the practice quizzes and buy the optional workbook (almost all the test questions come from these two sources). DiIanni is very knowledgeable and truly cares about whether his students understand the material or not. Lectures are interesting and his real-world examples help so much.,Best Economics professor I've ever had. He explains concepts in such a crystal-clear way and is fun to talk to outside of class is well! The exams are tough but the quizzes are super easy (answers are online). 10/10 would take again.,"A wonderful person and even better professor. This class was so enjoyable not only because of the material, but the way in which it was delivered. You really can't go wrong with DiIanni.","Best dressed professor on campus. Very relevant material, even though he's often outspoken. Very calm and well-prepared. Knows how to deal with a lot of nonsense.",You don't have to work too hard for an A in the class.

Highly recommended if you want to learn.,"Econ-302 with him is neither the hardest nor the easiest class that I have taken. Professor Dianni is an excellent teacher and he is very knowledgeable about economic issues. He is also very approachable to students, but he has very strong opinions on economic issues, opinions with which some students might disagree.",Very approachable. Gives a different insight into economic thinking than most professors offer. Challenges and expands your own thinking.,"Diianni is a great professor and clearly a great guy. He knows so much about the world of Economics and is great at giving real life examples to explain the material taught in class. The class, however, is quite difficult. The exams are similar to the previous exams, but a few questions tripped me up. The final exam my semester was extremely hard.","ECON 102 was fairly easy, if you buy the workbook and do the old exams then the actual ones are very similar. You can tell that DiIanni is very passionate about the subject, however lectures could get a little boring. Basically as long as you do the work book then you should get an A, don't bother getting the actual textbook","There's 3 midterms and a final. DiIanni is super chill, so you can skip any (or all) of the midterms, and the weight of that exam will be put on your final. He also gives past exams and how to do math problems in his workbook, so you don't really need to go to class (but graphs aren't provided). He offers a good amount of extra credit too!","He was an OK lecturer, I guess success is based on the TA. Lecture material kind of matched the exam,  but I was blindsided a lot.","I thought his lectures drug on and on. While he certainly is brilliant, he has a tendency to over-explain simple topics to the point of confusing. The flip-side is that he loves to help students during office hours. A little pompous, but overall a good guy. Avoid him at the sub-400 level; take him for 400-level courses. He's much better there.","Professor DiIanni is a gifted lecturer and knowledgeable on many economic topics. He explains concepts and answers questions clearly and effectively. ECON 102 is a breeze so long as you review the previous years' exam solutions, which are readily available in your course packet. His impeccable wardrobe is also a plus.","Great professor lots of freedom of attendance, exams, quizzes, and discussions. Not boring at all so focusing won't be a problem. Should pass the class with an A or B anything less is just piss poor effort.","He's cool. Class was easy. Background on me, I got an A-/B+ and 5 on AP Macro.   I didn't have to study at all. Went to lecture, took notes, went to discussion and did readings. Fair grading policies with missed midterms.   Studied with the practice exams in the workbook and nothing else. That workbook is worth it. Online textbook, didn't use.","Spends a bit of time debunking liberal myths ('There are more poor people in US than in Europe', 'labor unions are good' etc.). One point extra credit for taking a survey or something. Honestly most of it is just simple math, some intuition and definitions. You can skip midterms and get the weight shifted (beware).

Lectures are long and boring; homework is not related to quizzes or the final exam. there are no midterms but instead several quizzes, each worth 10% of your final grade. Usually there are only 1-3 questions in a quiz, and the concepts tested are completely random.","I really really wish he would read these comments. Lecture 1 starts with the laws of thermodynamics and a bunch of differential equations without a proper introduction to the subject. It goes downhill from there: poor teaching, random quiz problems, and a flabbergasted when faced with a question - Dillon is the epitome of  a prof. to avoid.","Gives boring lectures, force you to sleep. Homework is not related to exams at all!! Grading policy is strict, making course very very hard.      Textbook is not useful at all.","This class is terrible. Instead of exams, you have seven quizzes and get to drop one and those six quizzes make up 70% of your grade. He is never clear on what material each quiz will cover. The grades on the quizzes range from 40%-100%.","This is a thermodynamics class and people expect to show up to class and take notes and get by with an A!  Thermo takes time to understand &amp; Dillon does a great job to dissect the book for us and give us the most important info. Plenty of videos and online note, just put in the work.  IMO the BOOK is awful and stunts peoples learning in this class.","It is surprising that a highly ranked MSE program provides such a course on  thermodynamics,which is taught by this professor. The content taught in the class is too shallow and the instruction is not clear.","I'm a straight A student and have a C or D in this class.

Professor tended to get flustered if he is asked questions in Class, especially pertaining to some math related content such as complex numbers and PDE in  class.","Gets flustered if you ask questions, and often does not fully address it in his answer.  Obviously knows the material, but has difficulty conveying it to students.  But, grades pretty leniently and curves the class at the end.","Get's kinda flustered/lost during class, but if you ignore that and stay focused I think he actually makes concepts easy to understand.

Sometimes she's too serious about stupid things like technology use. And if you sit at the front and talk a lot she'll love you she def has favorites.,"Not exactly what I was expecting.

He's open minded and I really loved his sort of Hipster style. He incorporated a lot of current events to the class which made it more intimate. Overall a great prof.","Since starting to teach at SUNY Oneonta, he is very monotoned,&amp; at times is very interesting to listen too. H He gives very basic instructions for assignments, which he does not put in hard copy,so you always keep askng him to repeat himself. He didn't use a textbook,the readings he did post were online and were long (ie 70+ pgs)",I disliked him so much.  He seemed unsure about everything he said and his class lectures were so boring.  The tests werent bad if you did the 70 pages of reading a week which was a ridiculous amount for one class.  He seems educated in the subject but isn't clear on any of the material.,Great prof... hope I get to take more classes with him...,No Comments,He's a really nice guy and really interested in the material. Most of it is pretty interesting. TONS of reading...almost impossible to get it all done. The exam questions were kind of tricky. But he gives a lot of extra credit opportunities so an ok grade is possible.,No Comments
1595555,4.3,Florin,Dolcos,5,0.5866867833089243,Confusing class.  The teacher never wrote what questions were right/wrong on the first exam taken.  The last two exams haven't been graded the entire semester so there is no telling what grade you might have as that is what the class is graded on.  He never uploaded grades on compass either.  I have no idea if I'm even passing this class as of now.,"Really nice and helpful professor. The class he teaches is so useful to anyone trying to learn about how the brain works, and it is interesting how he produces scientific data to back up what he says. Somehow he manages to make it really funny too. I would recommend the class to any student, grad or undergrad.","Interesting class, funny teacher, and not too hard if you pay attention in lecture. You learn a lot of interesting things that you can use in everyday life that will impress others, but it's not too difficult to learn. I would recommend it to any grad or undergrad student. I took it as an undergrad and really benefited from it. Check it out!","The class is very interesting, helpful, and I would recommend it to any student,especially a psychology major. Professor Dolcos somehow finds a way to make the class interesting and he is really funny. The class is easy if you pay attention to what is said in lecture, but you will still be able to impress others with how much you learn. Great class","I thought this class was easy and informative. Only journal articles to read, 3 tests, and a 12pg paper.  For this being a joint grad/undergrad class, it was surprisingly easy if you followed the slides and have an interest in neuroscience.  Dr. Dolcos is important to his field so don't be surprised that he authored many of the readings assigned."

Her classes have taught me more than any other class and have allowed me to apply cognitive neuroscience to everyday life.,She is kind of nice,"She may come off as a boring prof, but when I took her class FA '15 she really tried to engage the class by encouraging questions and participation. Material was pretty bland so it's hard to pay attention. At the end of the semester I pulled a solid A by doing the extra credit. Study for the tests. They aren't too bad, but don't blow them off.","Lectures are not super clear or easy to follow, but not too bad either. I don't feel that she answers questions very well. Lots of video clips. You get points for daily attendance, but it is not a large part of the grade. 204 is probably the easiest of the classes that fulfills the bio/cog psych degree requirement."

I hated science. Ed reached out to me and helped me through his course, made me love and appreciate biology. Today, I am a science teacher thanks to Ed. Thank you!!!",He cares about his students,"Though there were assignments regularly and time is needed for understanding the knowledge, Ed is really nice, patient and kind. I enjoyed having his class though I spent much time doing its homeworks.",IB 100 second 8 weeks online with Ed Dole is miserable.  Ed Dole is the most mysterious man in the world. He thinks that everyone loves Biology as much as he does but they don't! This class is not for anyone who doesn't have a girlfriend that is a Bio major.,"Horrible class, worst professor. Tons of HW and assignments, hard exams for online section. Avoid this gene class, it will hurt your gpa. Love Life, leave ed dole!","This class is horrible, the professor is insanely bad, the worst professor ever in my study. Avoid this class, it will spend you tons of time for a gene class. And the assignments and exams are hard for online sections, don't hurt you GPA! the worst class","He is the worst professor I have ever seen in this school. Believe me, don't take his online class to fulfill your gene requirement. He gives tons of hw and very hard assignments and exams. This is only a 100 level class, he thinks you are already pro in biology. This is awful for an intro class. I swear I ll not take any IB class after his class.",This class was horrible. i had SO much busy work. during lecture they randomly take attendance and all he does is show you links which is COMPLETELY pointless; you don't learn anything. Dole treats you like a 5th graders and this class is like you are back in middle school science again. AVOID!!,"Way too much work for a gen ed class. LOTS of assignments that do not help on the exam. I wouldnt be bothered by this, except for the fact that the website he uses is extremely difficult to navigate. Additionally, he also posts assignments at random times that will sometimes be due in only a few days. There's an easier gen ed out there, kids","This class is ridiculous. WAY too much work for an INTRO TO BIO class. He doesn't seem to understand that. His design of the class is terrible. Website is useless, homework assignments are useless, lab material is useless and the book is useless. DO NOT take this if you're not a bio major, you will regret it, guaranteed.","He seems like a nice guy. Tests are not bad, he gives good review online. The main problem with the course that almost EVERYONE experiences is the ridiculous amount of homework assigned. It's at least 2-3 assignments per week, usually taking up to an hour to complete. His online moodle site is confusing. He really needs to limit the homework.","Awesome guy, the class was a great and pretty easy overview of biology, encouraged me to look into bio further and I wound up with a minor in ESES.",I took ib 100 for a gen ed and i soon realized i could have found a better option. the only good thing about the class is that there is a ton of extra credit (7%) but besides that the class is unorganized and his lectures are impossible to follow. i only got an A because my friend is a bio major and helped me. try to pick something else...,"If you are looking at this class to meet a gen ed, pass on it. His lectures are boring and impossible to follow. The website he uses for the class is very complicated. He makes the class difficult for an 100 level course.",Great guy he is so nice and helpful.  He really cares about his students.,He breaks down Biology thoroughly when you don't undestand a topic. He's also very friendly,"Super easy class. Sometimes unclear at times but if you can read the text book and study exactly what he tells you (he pretty much gives you the test!) you will do fine. No curve, but lots of e.c. opportunities.",This class is fairly easy but there's a LOT of busy work.  A lot of your grades depend on the TA.  Mine was pretty ridiculous in that I needed to state the obvious when explaining something on an assignment or I'd get marked off for it.  Random in-class assignments (often just signing your name) for points. Way too much work for a gen ed class.,Class was easy if you do the work. Ton and tons of busy work with assignments and such. I myself earned 6 percent of extra credit and earned my A. Study hard for exams and it will pay off. Overall really nice guy though.,"Ed Dole is so nice. His lectures are mind numbingly dull, but attendance is pretty much a necessity. Random lecture activities to take attendance. Take-home Assignments every other week. Exams aren't too shabby. Overall, not a bad class, but those take-home assignments might drive you a tiny bit crazy. Oh and don't even bother buying the text book."

If you dont follow the directions on the papers and tests your grade will suffer. Good luck youll need it,"Having never taken Anthropology before, I knew I would most likely have to work a little harder than others. That being said, I worked incredibly hard to read the books, participate and still couldn't catch a break. The lectures are rambles and the papers are graded way too hard for a 200. Though content was interesting, the class was awful!","She spends the first 15 mins of class talking, then has lecture slides that have paragraphs on them, causing her to always go over time. Also she has often needed help from the tech dept with using the projector. She has been notably rude and disrespectful to the tech employees that come and fix her problem.",Repetitive lectures,"VD is... interesting. As a human being, she's perfectly fun and natural and talking to her is always enjoyable! However, as others have noted below, she is a little over-eager for a 200 level course, and the workload is a little inappropriate.  The reading is fascinating, and she certainly makes you think, but there are better courses for that.","Literally the worst professor I have ever had. If you disagree with anything she says in the response papers, she will getting offended and grade subjectively. The lectures make you feel awkward and uncomfortable. She doesn't address the slides and talks about nothing for the first 15 minutes and then goes over time to finish the last slide.","This isn't a blow off class. She expects the best of your work. She's very supportive and is always willing to sit down and meet. If you put in the work and actually think critically, like an anthropologist, you'll do fine.",Worst teacher and class of my life.  Spent the entire time talking about her self.  Does not teacher and her assignments are unclear and pointless with awful grading practices.,"Despite what people on here have said, don't be afraid. While she expects a lot from her students, she is very kind. Her classes arent the kind you want to slack in, though; only take them if you truly want to learn and if you're interested in Anthropology. She assigned a lot of reading, but I enjoyed them nonetheless","What the people have written below is somewhat true but also reductive. You aren't tested on every sentence from the readings, and you don't have to copy the slides verbatim to do well. VD offers her time and answers all your questions. Sure, her lectures can be diffuse, but they're always insightful, sophisticated, and thought-provoking.","VD gave so much reading that most people stopped doing it out of frustration (7 books for a 200 level class.) The papers had suffocating guidelines. VD doesn't post her powerpoints, which is especially upsetting considering the walls of text that can't be typed, much less hand-written, as fast as she changes slides. Bad prof. Wouldn't recommend.","She is horrible. She talks about herself the entire time plus you don't learn anything,, slides are a joke,, Plus the TA was ridiculous and constantly contradicted herself,was really rude and wasn't helpful to students. I recommend taking another teacher for this class.","Completely self absorbed. Constantly talking about herself. Excruciating to listen to her lecture, but you can't do well in the class if you don't attend every single lecture. Doesn't put her powerpoints online either, which is annoying because there is SO MUCH text on them, causing you to have to scramble to write down all of her nonsense.","I am not an anthro major and I think she is completely reasonable. I'm usually a harsh critic when it comes to professors, but she isn't bad at all. If you go to lectures and discussions and skim the readings and you'll be fine.","if you see this woman... RUN. if she is teaching a class...DON'T TAKE IT. Full of herself, unhelpful, rude, circular logic, unclear directions, unreasonably high expectations, the physical manifestation of evil.","For a Gen Ed, this class was ridiculous. It was very heavy on the reading, and having completed the assignments and gone to lecture, there is still no guarantee that you will do well in the class. Dominguez has perfected the art of using 50 minutes to say absolutely nothing; never arriving at a point, and aggravating most of the student body.",This was the worst class i have taken at this university. The grading and expectations were ridiculous for a 100 level class.,DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS WITH DOMINGUEZ! ADV majors-take PSYC and SOC. This class is a waste of time. u have to read 6 books on top of other readings-NOT WORTH IT! she doesn't realize that no one has interest in anthropology. this class took up way too much time to be a 100 level class. lectures are like torture.,No Comments,"pointless and very repetitive discussions.  If you have this professor, RUN! She unnecessarily repeats herself and does not understand how to run a class efficiently.

He's great at explaining complex tax laws/rules in a way that is easily understandable. Makes class fun/interesting,"Hands down, my most fave professor of all time.","Despite looking like Graem Bauer, the villain from season 6 of 24, Donohoe was a really good teacher.

Honestly, i recommend this class, its pretty cool and not hard!","Alright, so this is basically a blow off class for most people who aren't pursuing a meteorology major.

Highly recommend him.",Dowdall is boss. He is very courteous and is always willing to help whenever needed. His exams are fair as long as you've been keeping up with the material. He made a very difficult class seem like a breeze. I definitely recommend him!,"Very easy going, just go to class and pay attention and you'll do great. Exams are fair and homework honestly is the hardest part of the class. He's pretty funny too",Love him!,He's just so cute!! Both his class and himself :),"I highly recommend Dowdall for Non-Euclidean Geometry. He was very organized, explained content clearly, was always willing to help with questions/confusion, spoke clearly, and was knowledgeable in his content. His exams, quizzes and homework were fair, and he allowed for corrections on exams as well as one dropped homework grade.","Professor Dowdall was one of the best math teachers I have had. He made class somewhat interesting and was very clear what his expectations were. His tests were very fair, and he allowed you to get points back through test corrections. I would def recommend taking a class with him"
892361,4.9,Julie,Dowling,9,0.7091994754695553,"I would die for her. She's an absolute genius and an amazing instructor. The class includes 2 articles to read a week, +3 short books, 1 book report, 1 book presentation, and a final essay. It sounds daunting but is actually very doable. Class is discussion-based and very very engaging, plus you watch a lot of interesting documentaries.",Professor Dowling is awesome! Just a midterm and a final research paper (8-10 pages) on the topic of your choice (super easy). Skim the readings (due daily) and participate in class and you'll get an A!,"Professor Dowling is amazing! I really had no prior interest in the subject matter, however the class covers such an array of intriguing material. Very fair grader, reading intensive and discussion based, but as long as you skim the readings before class you'll be fine. I highly recommend this class! (Easy Adv Comp!)","I loved this class, take it!","Awesome, awesome class! Totally interesting subject and great professor.  Made us think about things in a different way and go outside our comfort zone.  I would recommend to take any class she is teaching!","She's enthusiastic, knows her stuff, and cares about her students...my favortite class and professor so far!!! The person below obviously didn't go to class very often..lol.","Best Professor I've ever had. Talks fast, is hilarious, attentive, caring....so many words. Tough on students who don't show up to class since inclass participation makes up most of her class. She allows people to freely express themselves and creates a great enviroment for learning.","SHES A VERY STRAIGHT FORWARD PROFFESSOR, SHE USES POWERPOINT SLIDES THAT ARE VERY USEFUL FOR QUIZES AND SHE WILL TELL YOU WHAT THE QUIZES ARE ON.  EVEN THOUGH SHE TALKS ABOUT TEXAS EVERY LECTURE, SHES A VERY GOOD PROFESSOR THAT  KNOWS WHAT SHES TALKING ABOUT!! I RECOMMEND TO TAKE ONE OF HER CLASSES.","Course packs are expensive, but other than that, courses are interesting, exams are very straightforward, and she makes it a point to tackle difficult subjects. Coursework is not particularly challenging however, and her liberal beliefs do show some in class, though not to the degree that a conservative would hate the class."
734930,4.7,Heather,Downes,17,0.5759036016442285,This class is very easy! Prof. Downes is really funny and keeps class lively.

EASY ONE PAGE RESPONSE/WEEKLY. AND MY SECTION TECHER WAS BEAUTIFUL LOL.  BY THE TIME OF THE FINAL YOU WILL SEE PEOPLE YOUVE NEVER SEEN IN THAT CLASS BEFORE , THATS HOW EASY IT IS ( THEY DONT COME)","The easiest 4 hr course. Don't buy the book. Go to class to take notes, or copy them from the book, in which case, buy the book. Either way, go when there are movies as movie Q's are on the exams. The exams are very easy, just go over your notes. Go to discussion for points (attendance, participation, and near-weekly 1 page assignments are &gt;50%).","THIS CLASS IS TOO EASY! Don't buy the book, there is absolutely no need. Go to class and take down all notes unless you have a friend in class who can give you all the notes, including info on the movies shown in class than you don't have to go to class at all. EASY A","There's two ways to take this class, either go and don't buy the book, or buy the book and don't go. You need to go to every discussion, but I never went to lecture and got an A-. But honestly lectures are fun, and she's hot.",She is really awesome!  The lectures are so interesting and she is explains the material in a fun way.  I would DEFINATELY suggest taking this class.  I loved how we didn't have a textbook and were able to print the readings out on e-reserve.,"Downes is awesome!! She was great in SOC100 and was twins with Tina Fey. She's young and tries to make the class fun with movies every friday. Don't buy the book b/c she gives you study guides every week, just go to lecture where she goes through literally every answer. Discussions are mandatory but it's an amazingly easy A","I highly recommend taking this class to fulfill gen ed requirements.  Don't buy the book-you'll never use it.  Lecture was often shortened, and we watched movies in class once a week.  Two tests (midterm and final) and both were 50 multiple choice questions.  I skipped class often and still got an A.  Professor can be funny at times.","She is super easy. Her test are composed of definitions and all the examples she gives in lecture. Discussion is very easy too, but boring as well. She gives an extra credit opportunity. However she is so BORING and her jokes are stupid.",She's absolutely adorable and incredibly sweet.  Her lectures are really really interesting and she's tons of fun.,she is cool and cute,So funny and a genuinely cool person.,"Well, she's really easy, but I didn't see that as a good thing.  She doesn't really hold you accountable for much information at all, but I guess she was an ok teacher.  A bit annoyingly phony, but nice.",She is an amazing teacher and really clear.  There are two tests (non cumulative) and you have to write about two movies.  I recommend seeing her before you turn in your paper because she will tell you what you need to fix!  Great class and the tests are easy if you go!,"Super nice and very clear, gives great study guides for the test. Gives a great effort and expects the same. Attendance is part of your grade so go to class but this is one class that you will learn something from!",No Comments
459555,4.8,Stephen R.,Downie,38,0.6250443995200128,Professor Downie was right when he warned us about his class. I enjoyed his class; he uses the class manual to look over the most important characteristic of the plants families. There are a lot of quizzes and extra credit and some of these question came in the final. Overall it was a good class and his goal is teach about botanic.,"I took this class two years ago and I thought I never would ever use the material I learned, well I jost got a job where I have to identify plants and I am so happy thank you dr Downie!",One of the best professors I have experienced. Knew the material he was teaching inside and out. Always returned my emails within the hour and cared about teaching and the students well being. Lecture exams are difficult but the extra credit options are helpful for grades and as a great learning tool. Would take a class from him again,"A surprisingly great class.  Took it with some trepidation because I had to, but I found it informative and ... dare I say it ... interesting.  A bonus is I think I can now identify plants using identification keys -- something I couldn't do previously!",He really knows the material and was able to convey it to the students.  He would go out of his way to make sure the students succeeded in his class; he really cared about how they performed.  He provided ample opportunities to improve the students' grade. He was an enthusiastic teacher who was passionate about the subject,"This is the best course I've taken at U of I.  Downie makes something that sounds pretty boring actually interesting.  He knows the material extremely well, and is very helpful with any problems you're having with the material.",Very nice and helpful. Simple college biology.,"IB 335 was probably the best class I've taken at UIUC. Downie is a great teacher, and  is enthusiastic about what he teaches. He wants you to get something out of the class and do well. As long as you attend lecture and keep up with the various assignments,  it's a fairly easy class.",A good gene class.  He gives lots of extra credit so its good.  Lots of information and sometimes tough to have to learn so much but the tas are good and they help me.  I learn lot about giology.,"IB 100 is an excellent, introductory biology class.  The pace is quick, so be prepared!  The course resources are excellent.  Come to lecture, pay attention, do the assignments and extra credit, and you'll do well.","Absolutely excellent professor. Any plant biologist interested in, systematics, anatomy &amp; morphology, or field work should certainly work with the Professor. Also, any ecology majors expecting to do field work would benefit tremendously from Downie.",Down and dirty class in how to put together your own digital library. Very collaborative atmosphere pushes all students. Don't be afraid to step up when asked to participate.,Downie is nice and all but do not take this class if you're taking other upper level IB courses. This class requires a lot of studying/dedication. But he tries to make it interesting,This class was very interesting! Despite everyone's uneasiness about biology Prof. Downie tried his best to make it interesting and relatable. He provides effective powerpoints that helps you on the tests/exams. He encourages Off hours and overall it was a good course because of him even though sometimes I did fall asleep!,"IB 100 is an excellent course, taught by an excellent instructor.  Prof. Downie makes the material interesting and relevant.  I didn't think I would enjoy biology, but after taking this course I would recommend it to everyone!","Arguably, one of the best classes I have taken at the U of I. Prof Downie really knows his stuff, and his Canadian accent is kinda cute.",IB 335 was one of my favorite and also one of the most useful classes I have taken at the U of I.  I would definitely recommend it becoming a required course for NRES majors in the future.,"Downie is a nice professor, but over all it's a lot of work to memorize plant families when you have other upper level IB classes.","A terrific class with lots of useful information which reminds me of a song I heard and it helped me understand the material and the song goes like this. If your ACA turns to ACT There's a world of problems For you and me. For the bases won't hold, And the protein won't fold, From your genome after all. Ha!  A great class.","Biology is the only science in which multiplication is the same thing as division.  This is confusing, but what I learned in this class, I think."

788574,4.2,Stephen,Downing,13,0.4715680602021136,ME 431 is a pretty good class. He is a very straightforward lecturer and uploads his notes online. He does not respond to emails though so you have to talk to him in person. Class has 5 group projects and 1 individual project. They are not too time consuming.,"Great professor. Very into the students and enjoys teaching the material. English, very clear lectures. Exams and projects are fair and interesting.",Great professor!,Good Professor. Tends to be very structured with lectures and understandable. The labs are what makes the class difficult. The material isn't too bad. Would suggest him if available.,"Good professor, sometimes the lectures can be dry, but he sometimes can make funny comments out of left field that grab your attention.  The labs for this class were tedious, but the class material and exams were straightforward, given that you study.  His lecture slides were very comprehensive and helpful.  Definitely recommended.",Boring professor but he does he gets the job done. The homework is graded strictly. But if you do the work/go to class/stay awake you'll be fine.,"(3.8/5.0) Statics is a dry subject and I had it at 8am. I think he did a good job considering the circumstances of the class. Just be very careful, it's easy to make stupid mistakes in this class. I did my homework during my TA's office hours which helped a lot.",Excellent lecturer and is very clear. The notes he gave from his powerpoint were very good too. Tests were tough but fairly graded and curved.  He and the TAs were also helpful with homework during office hours.,"You could tell that he spent a lot of time making the slides and enjoys teaching. He kind of put a lot of people to sleep though, but maybe that's just because that's what TAM does. Apparently, he's not very helpful in office hours, so i recommend you go to the TA office hours because they're really helpful","Excellent lecturer! Be sure to GO TO LECTURE! 20% of the first exam dealt with material he emphasized only in class (and not on his lecture notes). Very thorough in what he expects you to learn. He's probably one of the best professors I've had.  If you try hard, you'll be fine; definitely recommend.","His final exam was far more difficult and unfair than his hourly exams, people went into the final with great grades, and many left with c's or worse!","Very good professor. Could get boring at times, but that kind of goes with the subject of engineering materials. There is only so much that you can talk about with respect to heat treating and still be interesting. Helpful, nice, fair tests and fair grading.","Very monotone lecturer, put me to sleep every time. Still, he knows the material very well, and his lecture slides are very thorough. Problem is, he has a tendency to put info in his slides that's too advanced and won't be covered on exams, anyway. You really only need the book to succeed in this course."
2369585,3.0,Patrick,Drackley,1,0.29184964069357594,"The class is relatively easy and he explains things fine, although he is an annoying guy and doesn't allow laptops or phones to be out during lecture. Also there are iclicker points for every lecture."
1223065,2.9,Lindsey,Drager,11,0.37405481500247606,best I've ever had.,"She suffers few fools. The students in the class drooled too often for my taste. Gross. This is college yo. Thinks wicked fast. I think she made a lot of references, most of which I only got a year or more later. Plays the long game. Asks a lot of questions. Hard not to pay attention when she talks.","Not sure about the Rhet rants, perhaps bad students. Lindsey was a lot of fun and was helpful, even lending out own copies of books to look at for writing ideas. Always pleasant and nice. Her own writing on the internet is quite funny/good. I reccommend.","She was great. No idea what all the negative comments prior to mine were about. If she was like that before, I would never be able to tell. Big recommendation for her in a required gen-ed class.","I came into this class thinking, ?I?m an English major, writing is my thing.  Here comes an easy A,? but then I met Lindsey Drager.  She in no way shape or form should be teaching this class, or any for that matter.  Her comments while many, were completely unorthodox and the topics she assigned were ridiculous!  Thanks to her I barely passed this",She's pretty good.,She went against every major point she made in the syllabus. Attendance: She failed to show up to five classes without telling us. LateWork: NEVER returned any of our papers. ClassroomEtiquette: Always texted and took phone calls in class. Plagiarism: All she did was read right out of the book.,"Lindsey Drager is the best professor you could have for Rhet 105?NOT!! The class was miserable. She would come in 10 minutes late and make the students stay an extra 10 minutes. For essays, she makes up random topics and you have to write 10 pages for all 4 of the essays. THE CLASS BLOWS, DON?T TAKE THE CLASS!!!","The first day I walked into this class I almost walked out in 10 minutes. She told us we would have more work than any other Rhet class, we would have 2 research papers, 10 essays, 15 responses, daily journals, and read two textbooks. The readings take at least four hours! There is no reason you should ever take this class, TAKE SOMETHING ELSE!!!!!","DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS! Lots of writing and too many papers. She gives you a 5 page paper assignment 2 days before it?s due! Also WAY too much reading! And she will have pop quizzes over the readings, which are impossible. Also the researcher paper is WAY too much work for a 100 level course! Save your time and DON?T take!!!",No Comments
1842639,3.8,Peter,Dragic,6,0.42421201045540663,"He has a good knowledge of the material and teaches well, such that one can understand the stuff well if they listen to the lecture. What was weird for me was that he taught using scanned handwritten notes and hadn't bothered to make slides. The course didn't have any exams. The grade was solely determined by HW and final project. rather easy.",Really cool guy.,"Pete was the coolest professor I've had yet. Yeah he used the slides a lot, and yeah he got excited and sometimes missed small parts, but he was among the most willing people here at the university level to help me when I had questions. His best quality is that he isn't stuck up like some of the other staff, he's laid back and chill.","Dragic may use slides consistently, but it's next to impossible to take notes in his class. He constantly goes off on tangents, clicks rapidly back and forth between slides, and asks ""does that make sense?"" after everything, which is almost always followed by blank stares from the class.","I really enjoy the way he teaches. Too many professors get caught up in the math of things, but he really focuses on developing an intuition for the physics of behind all of this. Also he's a really nice guy, very approachable, and has a good sense of humor.","Of the three professors during FA13, he was the only one using slides consistently which made it MUCH easier to follow along."
1516853,2.7,Tiberiu,Dragu,3,0.3942086804303196,"Very arrogant, rude, and condescending to students and to the university. He bragged in class about how he was going to leave for a better university. Does he not realize how rude that is to students to say things like that? Otherwise not a challenging or interesting course at all.",Probably one of the best political science professors at the university. Classes are interesting and rely on critical thinking instead of memorization.,Pompous. Exams were horrible. Expect to write 10+ pages for your midterm and final. How he grades is extremely inconsistent and indicative of an arrogant close-minded professor. Are all Stanford Ph.Ds like this? Look his performance up from Pittsburgh- apparently he was really horrible there too.

982499,5.0,Susan,Dramin-Weiss,16,0.7286974994034288,Susan is the most amazing instructor in the world! She makes you feel passionate about learning ASL. She is understanding and a very fair grader. She makes me laugh in class and is nice. She usually ends class a little early and is lenient on grading. I could have gotten an A in her class if I would have practiced.,So so so so so good,"Great professor! One of my favorites ever. I'm not the best at sign language but she never made me feel discouraged or stupid and she helped me genuinely learn. You definitely need to go to every class because if you miss one you will miss a lot of info. The Multiple choice tests are pretty easy, but signing one on one is a bit harder. Lots of EC!","I had Susan for both 121 and 221. She's one of the best professors I've ever had the pleasure of having. She truly cares about all her students and wants you to succeed. She is ALWAYS willing to help out if you need it. I wouldn't say it's an easy A, because you definitely have to work. I recommend going to the EC events - really helps you out.","Susan is amazing. I wish I had her again. She is so adorable and fun, loves what she does, and is super passionate about her students. She makes time to get to know your name and face and is always positive and patient. If you skip class or come late, she will not like you.",Susan is one of the nicest people I have ever met. She will work with you if you don't understand something and provides plenty of extra credit opportunities. I had her for ASL 1 &amp; 2 and she is easy to understand without prior ASL knowledge,Susan is awesome! You should definitely take any ASL class with her over any other teacher.,She's great! We get out an hour early. She's straight and to the point. She grades fairly and the multiple choice quizzes are easy.,Susan is by far my favorite ASL prof thus far. She has a very relaxed teaching style and is very willing to work with students when it comes to class conflict/assignment issues. Gives extra time for some things. Very fun in class experience!,Susan is amazing!  She is so much fun and she teaches at a pace that feels comfortable for everyone.  Definitely recommend this class and her!,"Susan is awesome guys, you really want this class! She is very understanding and lenient on turning in things.We always got out early and she a very fair grader.","Susan is a great teacher.

1430440,4.2,Fritz,Drasgow,2,0.6275747196399053,Best professor I've ever had. Couldn't find someone else who is more knowledgeable and experienced in I/O Psychology. He keeps the class extremely interesting and uses very impressive examples for literally everything. Gonna try to find more courses with him.,"I enjoyed the class. Fritz seems to know a lot about personnel psych and answers students' questions clearly. He doesn't put slides on Compass so you have to go to class and take notes diligently. But if you study the notes well and follow his rubrics for the papers, you should do well in the class because it's curved."
1533519,2.2,Mark,Dressman,11,0.48465388767411444,"The professor does not like to have his ideas challenged. He can come up with every reason as to why he is right and you're wrong. He makes over generalizing statements about students abilities to read and they're often in a negative tone. This shouldn't be a mandatory class especially for educators in STEM, as this class does not cater to us.","The most useless class as a student in education. They put multiple content areas into one course, that the professor does not have any experience with and cannot instruct. The expectations in this class is inconsistent. After putting in hours of effort, assignments are not graded timely, and have no feedback. ""change your life""--okay.",The things you learn in this class will be useless. Doesn't grade the assignments so you won't ever know how you're doing and even if you have an assignment graded you won't receive any feedback. Thinks that we as future teachers should be technological geniuses that have all the time in the world to create online presentations for your students.,"While the course was beneficial to experience in the field, the professor was unable to make compromises and was not open to suggestions. He was difficult to work with, and did not listen well to others opinions. He often made inappropriate and unkind remarks to the students. His information was out of date.","Yes, this Professor seems to care about education. However, he is unorganized and difficult to work with. He teaches outdated research and technology. He does not listen to any opinions different from his own.

He's rough around the edges, and he's a little out of the times, but he definitely cares a lot.","Unclear  requirements . Makes some fairly offensive remarks on sensitive issues in class, which is surprising as it is an education class. Says that he will provide help and feedback but then doesn't end up doing it. Creates deadlines and then doesn't stick with them, but the class still turns in everything on the original due date. Meh.",He seems approachable but very disrespectful with other ideas. It is pretty annoying. It is 1-credit course and super easy to pass. A lot of group work and discussion. You learn as much as 1-credit course should be.,Awesome Teacher,Was not interested in the students as people. Did not provide useful techniques to utilize in the field. More concerned with past experiences and life instead of the present. Boring.,"Keeps you pretty interested, he is passionate about what he is teaching. Good class."
