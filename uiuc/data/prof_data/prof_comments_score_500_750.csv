Marco spent his time (back turned) reading the 50-70 powerpoint slides for the day. Slides were full of C-code and material copy/pasted from the man pages that were quickly clicked through because of its simplicity. I think he was competent but just couldn't express himself. Would not recommend.,"Well intentioned, but has no idea how to teach. Putting C code on a slide or referencing the man pages every 2 minutes is not teaching.","Marco definitely knows his stuff , but that translates to about 50 slides/lecture of material.

Go to office hours and you will earn excellent marks in her classes.,"Material is easy but test questions can be tricky. Pay attention in lecture, read the book (reading assignments are really short), and review the slides. The slides have all the answers you'll need.","Definitely the better teacher of IB150.Dr Marcot also teaches.She knows what she is talking about, and is very good at explaining things.

Gives extra- credit every two weeks for showing up to class. Remember that she ALWAYS gives extra credit the next class after an exam. And she gives extra credit right before breaks...times when most people don't show up. But lecture extra-credits are only worth 1 point, not 2 like the tests. An easy A if you try.",Interesting class and one of the easiest!!! She gives out Extra Credit for going to lectures. There is minimal work as only 3 out of the 4 test count for your grade.

I was full-A  junior student until i met her.","Professor Cacho was my best professor at U of I. Notice that the low ratings on here are from 100 and 200 level courses.

Excellent overall.","She is tough, but in a really good way.  She will push your writing and she is an excellent writer herself.  She could connect the dots more and have a bit more structure to her classes, like actually lecturing, but the readings and writing make it good either way.","The class was good at first, but then it turned into tremendous amounts of reading (over 100 pages per week) and there are quizzes every week and journals every time you go to lecture (attendance is mandatory). The TAs grade insanely hard. Dont recommend taking this if you just want an easy gened. She's a good professor but its way too much work.","I think she was having an off semester because I hear she is super strict and wasn't really with us.

Have learned many interesting facts, but the amount of readings is RIDICULOUS. Frank, her TA, is absolutely awesome!!!","The class is hard. We have two writing assignments and two to four reading assignments due a week, two five page papers, one debate, and a reflection paper on the class. I did not enjoy the material nor did I enjoy the class. She is extremely intelligent but difficult to understand. She is nice, but I was really confused about the material often.","Arguably the most insightfull instructor I have encountered here. Articulate and cutting edge thinking, that helps clarify complex issues around compartive race, gender, sexuality as these categories are embedded in economic, social and cultural contexts","She changed my life!

Passion is what puts him above the rest.  Always mentions the progression and innovation of the field and how excited he is.  Didn't personally like his style of teaching because he always used arbitrary formulas and I preferred solid examples.  If you like that way he is the professor for you.,"This is one of the most talented teachers I've met so far, which means much more than just ""very good at electromagnetism"". His explanations of complex topics are crystal clear. He is very friendly to the students and very knowledgeable.

He never used lecture notes, but completely understands his field of study.  Despite difficult topics, his class lectures were at least interesting.","One of the better ECE professors, in my opinion. He was also my advisor, and gave good advice. *Much* better than Ravaioli for 350. He always seemed to be enjoying himself while lecturing, which kept the class interesting.

He teaches concepts well, but challenges you to make jumps yourself, and you get no feedback as to whether your jumps are right.  If that doesn't bother you, he is a great teacher.","Best professor I ever had. He challenges his students to really understand (which makes it harder for those interested in only a grade,  but well worth it for students who need to use the material).  I highly recommend him.","I took this class together with Calc III, and this class turned out to be way easier and I learned more, because of Bruce. That is also saying that I had Carty for Calc III which is another story... but Bruce is awesome and I'm having him again for math 461.","Bruce is fantastic at teaching!  He always has several explanations on hand for each concept, so if you don't understand one explanation, he'll explain it to you an other way.  He cares very much about students and is happy to make appointments to meet outside of class.  Highly recommend!","His lecture is boring and he always pretended to be wise and have good understanding of math, actually many times, I don't think he understand what students were asking. He assigned hwk everyday even if his class almost never keep pace with the schedule, so you have to learn by yourself. Overall, his exam is fairly easy",He is one of the most stupid and boring teacher I have ever had in U of I. Likes giving speech about the beauty of math which is totally useless and boring.

Really helpful and patient in discussion sections. Exams are fairly easy.,"Great! Probably the best professor I have ever had... or would have had, if I ever attended class. Tried to make you understand things conceptually overall, and I know that description is thrown around a lot, but he really did. Explanations flowed well, too.","Too Damn Hard!!!! He was not helpful and did not work with my schedule when I wanted to meet with him, he suggested that I go to a TA instead. Very smart though. He knows his stuff but doesn't care for the students.","This course is one of the best course I have taken in UI.

Another good thing of this professor is he is very patient with students' questions, no matter how stupid or how hard the question is.",Taking his Mathematica section for 415 was a lot different than any other math class I've taken here.  The homework and his tests focus more on explanation  rather than computation.  This class was not easy though.  The later tests involve a lot of thinking and it can be tricky because Bruce loves playing around with agree/disagree logic questions.,"He's very helpful in office hours but lectures were just useless to go to..Just use his office hours instead. His exams are tough, especially his final exam.","You go to his class expecting to learn at least one chapter of the text, and you don't even get that, in 3 lectures.

The idea of learning how to explain math instead of just trying to solve it is an interesting one but that objective is not fully achieved by the instructor. This is my first Mathematica class and I am not sure if I will take another one again.,He is a fun teacher who makes linear algebra interesting. You learn to explain math and how to solve problem at the same time. I think he could do a better job in tying all the different ideas in linear algebra as the course progresses so that the math will make more sense.,The professor is one of the most professional teachers I've had at the university.  He is easily available if you have questions.  The tests are fair and basically come straight from our homework.  The mathematica linear algebra  course is the best course I've taken at the university.,"If you can take his Mathematica version of this class, DO IT. The homework isn't bad, and he'll prepare you well for exams if you show up for the class date once a week and his review sessions. Funny guy, knows the material very well and can teach it clearly.

You must read the book if you want to understand anything since she will definitely not teach it to you.,Worst professor I've ever had to deal with. Refuses to answer emails no matter how urgent or frequent they are. Clearly does not care for her undergraduate students at all. I had to drop my advanced research project because she'd never respond to my multiple emails. Avoid at all costs. Total waste of time and energy.,"Most of these comments are true: she was a terrible lecturer, explainer, was unavailable at all times unless it was for a quick chat after class, and her TA was clueless and was not fluent in English. I would never recommend this class and highly recommend you find someone to suffer through with you. This class requires an obscene amount of work.","Extremely boring. Almost no incentive to go to class because she has not really learned how to lecture. Also- the class is extremely psych heavy, so it is really hard for leadership minor students.","Refuses any contact with her undergraduate students, and does not reply to emails.  Sifts all communication through her TA, who is mostly poorly informed.  Assigns tedious amounts of work on assignments, though there are only 2.  Tests are easy, attendance not required.  Reads slides and drones on about details, not focusing on complex topics. Skip"

The class is pretty easy, the only problem I have with it is how hard he grades the Vlog worksheets that he gives out. The quizzes and the final were easy. Should be a fairly easy A if you are interested in the course material.",Edwin is an amazing teacher for this class. My advice to you is to MAKE SURE YOU TURN IN EVERY VLOG ASSIGNMENT AND GET TUTORING IF YOU ARE UNSURE ABOUT ANY QUESTION. If you do well on these small assignments your grade in the CLASS will be much higher than if you didn't. Quizzes are very easy as well as the exams; just study what he tells you.

Weekly reading quizzes(super easy). Exams relatively easy. Just take quality notes which she provides on her slides alongside with lecture videos.","I took ANTH 220 FA2016, it was a very interesting course and she was passionate about what she did. Occasionally, labs and interactive works were hard to follow, but overall I enjoyed the class.","I didn't like her class when I took Anth101, but I was impressed by Anth220 class. She made the class really interesting and I learned a lot about archaeology. I got to know her more and she's really nice to her students.","She is an awesome professor. Ask her anything and she knows it. As long as you read the chapters, you will be fine. Study for the exams as well.","I didn't think that an introduction to archaeology class could be very interesting, so I was surprised by this professor's class. She was really prepared, and understanding on those days when some of us couldn't quite get it organized. I will take another class with this teacher.",Definitely not a very hard GenEd and I didn't think it was that boring as well. The tests are essentially just memorizing definitions and the online quizzes are pretty easy. It helps that the participation points are essentially free and she is a pretty good lecturer.,"Show up and participate you will do well. Gives interesting lectures, very knowledgeable. Always willing to help a student and very understanding.","She's a pretty good lecturer and does not give hard exams. Don't buy the textbook; I never read them and I got along fine in class. She already covers everything t in the exam in her lectures, and prepare to take a lot of notes. She provides lecture videos just in case you missed them, although she uses iclicker to record mandatory attendance.","Pretty good professor and lecturer. Though I am a morning person and 8ams are fine for me, that may not be the case for you. Anyways, just make sure to keep up with the reading and pay attention in lecture and it should be an easy A.","Getting up at 8AM for this class was tougher than I thought it would be, I wasn't the most engaged student and I actually stopped reading the textbook in depth after a couple weeks. I'm sure I'd appreciate her more if I were aiming to be in the anthropology field and if it were a higher level class. How was this a gen ed?",This is not an easy gen ed course! You have to read A LOT!,Not a good 8 am class. The lectures are very long and dry especially at that time of the day. The tests are way too hard for a 100 level class. You really have to like the subject or you won't be motivated to read the book as in depth as you have to. This was honestly harder than my engineering classes.,Great person in general.,Don't ever take this course!,"I expected this class to be a blow of ten ed, but boy was I wrong. This class is way too hard for a gen ed. The tests are super tough. And the reading quizzes every week are way too detailed and are hard to find in the book. I can't wait for this class to be over. This class is killing my gpa, but it counts for like 3 gen eds, which is great.",Was told this was an easy class however not with this professor. As said before attendance is mandatory which sucks because it's an 8am. Weekly quizzes that are quite tough and requires you to read the text. Overall it's an interesting class but you have to work for your grade and isn't a blow off class.,"This new professor is way harder than the professors have been in previous semester.. what used to be a blow-off class is now one where the tests are actually difficult. Plus now attendance is mandatory for every lecture, counting for15% of the grade and only 2(!!!) being dropped out of all of them."

Loved to listen to her life stories. She made me feel extremely welcomed into her class. Plus, I learned so many things from her, and her SOCW 300 class.","She is well respected person who loves to hear the individual's voice. She is like a role model to make the class a safe and welcome place to express our feelings. No exams but a final. She tells you what's going to be on the final. Few big papers, few short assignments, and short open-notes online quizzes. Overall, I love the class and staff.","Most passionate professor out there.

Best of all, he genuinely helps you out and makes sure you understand without making you feel stupid. One of the best teachers I've had.","Teaches at Bradley now. His lectures link/flow together well, making reviewing for finals much easier. Tests can be challenging. He is extremely helpful in office hours; make use of them. He writes pretty much everything important on the board; make sure you jot it all down for good reference! He's also pretty funny. One of my favorite professors.","Awful professor, often put random material on tests, often will pick favorites in class, cannot teach material well and does not follow the book well",Not a good professor to take at all. Does a very poor job in explaining his topics and often makes no sense. Avoid taking any of his courses at all costs,"Mr. Carty is one of those teacher's you call a good guy, but a bad teacher. Teaches concepts as if we should already be experts, and has an odd and poor way of explanation.","Confusing when it comes to explaining material, isn't always available and very vague when explaining problems prior to homework or exams. Good Luck to anyone who has him in the future. My suggestion transfer out asap if you can.","You guys at UofI are lucky. Now he's at Bradley University as of 2013. I took calc1 in high school, understood it, and am currently retaking it because I didn't take the AP test. Tom makes round 2 so much more complex.

Calc III is hard, but not compared to the upper level classes.  Still remember him staying I would never make it in a math major.  Great office hours.  Expects you to read the book.","I had Carty for 241 and 285.  He is one of the best lecturers I've had at U of I.  However, his exams are usually unnecessarily difficult and I did find myself learning a lot on my own/from the book.  Carty is a really fun, if not harsh, professor, but be prepared to work your ass off.","Great teacher, great guy, doesn't stand for complaining or excuses.  A bit vulgar but funny. Very tough class, but worth it.","Carty is a tough cookie. His lectures are tough to follow and a good chunk is deriviing formulas (you only need the formulas and when to use them). He is also pretty mean and his exams are not easy but he curved them all. He's not unreasonable, though but you may need other forms of help in class","Tough class. People complain a lot, but Calc III is not an easy subject. The TA's are not too helpful, but you can go to his office hours and see if that helps. Go to lecture, take the notes, spend a lot of time going over past exams. A good grade is not unattainable, but it will take considerable effort.",One of the worst instructors I have ever had. He flies through the material in class and blames students if he cannot finish his lesson. His intimidation makes it difficult to ask for help.,"It can be an intimidating course but if you put the work in, you can get an A","Alright, all you hear is that Carty is terrible and the class is impossible. False. Go to class, take good notes, go to discussion, ask your TA questions, do the homework, study the practice problems and the practice tests.  Use other resources to study (Pauls Calc Notes/Cramster/Friends).  Carty's teaching style is different, not bad. Work hard!","Carty is a terrible professor. His lectures are geared towards the top 5% of the students in the class, while the other 95% have no idea whats going on. Coupled with a useless TA, it was the worst math class I've ever taken. The past exams, his only study tool, weren't even on the same material that he was testing us on.

Avoid at all costs, even if it means sacrificing a semester of math requirements.","Last comment was by Carty. You're not fooling anybody. Moving on, I thought the class was hard, but I did learn a fair amount. The only issue is that I had to work ridiculously hard for it. If you aren't afraid of the work, it's a good class.

You arent hard to approach either! Recommend all to sign up with him!,"Lectures are hard to follow, does alot of explaining on how to derive formulas rather than working explaining example problems.

He might try to be funny at times but it doesnt make up for the actual learning material of the course. AVOID","He tries to be funny, but he is a pretty big jerk. He likes to pick favorites out of the class. His exams are extremely hard. Try to avoid if possible.","Okay, So this guy is nice. But his exam is TOO DAMN HARD!!! He doesn't go over the textbook. He just teach you in his own way, and give you some hw in the book. Even if you got 5 on AP CAL BC, dont take his class.","This class is difficult. Taking notes is extremely important, especially since he doesn't usually go by the textbook and sometimes just tells you the textbook is wrong. don't write down derivations of equations, just the final equation/theorem and when to use it. Lectures are useful and some tests are works of the devil.","DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS! Find another professor. You may think it is not a big deal when you sign up, but after you fail the first and second test, you will regret every second. This class is impossible for anyone who plans on eating, sleeping and doing any other homework.","Incredibly tough. The lectures are incredibly helpful and he is really clear when lecturing. That said, his tests required a serious amount of studying, but at the end of it all, I learned more in that class than any other class. I would also like to point out that Carty is actually a pretty cool guy, but he intimidates like everyone.","Ridiculously tough exams, but I learned more in his math class than any other that I've ever taken.","This is one of the most difficult classes I've ever taken. That said, it is one of the classes I've learned the most in. I would suggest going to discussion and using worksheets to study for exams. If you know the worksheets in and out, you will be able to do well on the exams.",This is an extrememly difficult class.  If youre in the class the only way to do well is to go to discussion and hope someone there can teach it to you,"The hardest class I have ever taken, hands-down. Ignores most of what the book teaches yet assigns homework from it. Spends all lecture working on broad proofs rather than actual examples. Favors engineers and mathematicians over all else. Exams will make you want to put your head down and cry in your seat.","The first couple of weeks will be awkward and rough as you get used to his style (Hint: many people have called him ""The Ogre"" before, and they weren't exactly wrong) After a while, it gets easier, but you really have to take good notes and use them to understand ANYTHING on the homework/exams.","Carty is a great professor. Some people may not like his attitude, but if you see past that, you'll realize that he cares about his students and the class. It's a tough course, there's a lot of work involved, but if you stay on track and keep up with the lecture (ie read notes before lecture, go to office hours, etc) you'll be fine.","It's good that Calc 3 isn't all that difficult, because if it was, Carty wouldn't help you much. He knows his stuff, but the way he teaches is just not very clear to some. He has a lot of filler material within the main material, which just bores the hell out of you. His test difficulty depends on which section you're in.",real tough,His homework has nothing to do with the exams... be prepared...,"If you're one of those people who don't read the book, he's your perfect professor for you.  Everything you need to know are in his lecture notes. His method of teaching may confuse you but it all makes sense at the end of the semester.  But watch out, he's a good test writer, so study all the material well.",My favorite teacher in college so far. I loved his dynamic teaching style and down-to-earthness.

If you want to truly learn, take this class.  Thanks Erin!!",Erin's definitely one of the best teachers I've had in my education. She did demand a lot from us but her demands helped us learn so much more and maintain that knowledge. She took the time to get to know us and that is what made her a fantastic teacher.

The course material isn't so hard. You do have to attend lectures though. He's chill and makes the class interesting.,"Definitely too intensive for a 100-level class.

I definitly would drink a cup of coffee before coming to class. The TA's are very helpful in this class. The tests are kind of random and specific for such a low numbered class.,"Great class, great professor!  He tells funny stories during lecture and makes all the topics interesting.  There was no textbook required which was nice too.  He responds quickly to emails.  Overall, a very nice guy!  I would definitely take a class with him again!","There is no textbook, but there are required readings. On that note, if you read the readings and pay attention/ take notes at every lecture you should get an A. Very nice guy!","Loved the class. Easy as long as you take notes. The TAs are very helpful.

You can tell he's really excited about what he's teaching, and he makes it rub off on you.  Always eager to answer questions, sometimes will keep you longer after class to explain more than you asked about, just cause he loves math so much.","Gives very clear explanations and is very passionate about math.  Also tells a fair share of funny jokes.  I consider myself a good math student and had only gotten A's before this class.  Even if you are fully prepared, there is usually 1-2 tricky question on each exam.  By far the best professor for this course (average scores higher than others)","Cellarosi is amazing.  There are many concepts that were pretty difficult for me to grasp, but he made it entertaining and possible!  The tests were very hard, but the curve worked out for everyone in the end.

Great fashion sense. I also like his accent.,Nice teacher. He is so good and funny during lecture.,"While the grade on top lists the class average as a C-, it should be noted he curves his tests (which made up 85% of the grade) to a B- average. Was pretty interesting to listen to in class, even though it's pretty rough. The content isn't terrible, he tested what he needed to. Also I learned about Italy. 1010.","I had Cellarosi at UIUC for Calc 3. He was absolutely amazing. His lectures always maintained higher averages than the other professors, and he was clear and concise during class. He always added a touch of comedy (but not trying too hard) during lecture to keep students' attention. Besides, he's always wearing something artistically extravagant.",He's a really nice and clear professor.

Two different online homework assignments due every Tuesday, projects due every Thursday, and both are still due even if there is a test. She messes up a bunch of the problems done in class, which makes it difficult to follow along.",She isn't a very good teacher in general.

Well for starters, we didn't get a syllabus until a little over a month in but he pushes back due dates sometimes.

The class can be somewhat disorganized but if you pay attention it's not a problem.,"Very Unorganized...but that class, at times can be very interesting",Class is a joke. Tests are online (open note). Everybody gets an A. He lets you re-do written assignments. He scares you into thinking the tests are in-class and then changes his mind at the last minute.

His classes are relaxed and the discussion flows very well. He is very knowledgable about American lit as well as European philosophy. Only requires a few papers and a take-home final exam. Amazing educator.,"This is a class for people who know how to analyze a text.  It's very relaxed in most procedures.  The demand in the class isn't for busy work, but for a single great piece of analytical writing.  He's an extremely fair grader and intelligent on the subject.","This guy is really smart and insightful if you can pay attention. 3 papers: 3-5pg, 8-10pg, and the final exam is up to you for length (it's take home). It's hard to keep up with all the reading. I got off track really quick, but you're allowed to write your papers on ANY text during that period, not JUST the ones we read in class. I did all Poe :)","Prof. Chai provides background information that some might find unnecessary, but I enjoyed the historical and biographical context. This class is easy (2 papers and 2 take home exams, more stuff depending on your TA). My only complaint was that Prof. Chai was removed from the students- not once in lecture did he ask for our opinions or input.","So this class is pretty easy, but also pretty boring. Lecture isn't mandatory so hardly anyone goes, but you can tell that he is very intelligent and enthusiastic about his work. No tests and a few easy papers. Basically all depends on what TA you get.",Best teacher ever. Teaches about life and independent thought-- not just a school person. Brings literature to life and his students too. Changed me and others who paid attention.,"His pedagogical value is in his priorities, which go above and beyond petty academic formalities. He is a wise/experienced educator, fostering good thought and giving generous help. This is only the tip of the Chai iceberg, so more helpful facts and information on this instructor can be found here: http://www.geocities.com/western_theory/index.htm","Self-motivation is the idea in studying with him. Anecdotes often find their way into his speech &amp; are sadly often misread as drivel instead of elucidation. His mental powers are awesome; his friendliness and effective guidance are priceless gifts to pupils. Imagination is not one of his strong points, but he is the pure OPPOSITE of a Philistine.","He's a really intelligent guy, and his lectures flow like stories.

Very impatient (would make you feel stupid if you didn't know something), very arrogant (would talk forever about what a genius he is) and very intolerant.","Words cannot express the pain and terror I went through taking this course. Lectures were pointless, no structure at all. For the hw everyone was forced to copy the solution manual because he taught us nothing. Exams were impossible, ended up dropping a midterm because the average was a 35%. I had nightmares of him for weeks. Avoid at all costs!!!","This professor is like the plague, except not curable.  Avoid him for your sanity.  My take home final took hours, did not cover what he tried to teach in class, was very subjective, and unclear in what it was asking.  I would recommend never taking his classes, associating with him. They say, if you say his name he will strangle you in your sleep.","Unreasonable!! changes the grading scheme on last day of school to ""curve"" class whos average is 50%, but instead hurts the people already doing well in class (grade expected dropped from A to B because of his curve)","Dude is just unreasonable.  Talks about himself, and expects us to magically know the material before he teached it to you.  Then, if you don't know something, he acts like you're the worst person in the world and how stupid you must be for not knowing it.  Stay away from this guy.","The worst prof/teacher I have ever had in my life.  He tells people they should ask questions if they don't understand the material, but if you ask a question he will probably dismiss it and call you stupid.  Also the tests are impossible and are not at all reflective of the coursework.  Prepare to read the book, but even that might not save you.","VERY inconsistant.  He changed the syllabus three times at least and would choose to randomnly not accept the EC assignments, depending on who you were.  Oh yeah and if you went into his office hours, provided he made the ones he scheduled, he told you that you were pretty much stupid for making mistakes.  In short try to avoid him as a prof.","Professor Chaieb was a complete turd.  His tests are off the wall. He doesnt return any emails.  Likes to hide in his office behind a curtain and pretend that no one is there when we are knocking on his door.  Said he would hold office hours the night before the final, but he didnt show up. By far the most incompetent and worthless teacher ever.",Solid mechanics with Chaieb was the single worst academic experience I've had here at U of I. The exams were over our heads and in no way reflected the fundamental concepts we did in the homework. Expectations were never clear. Lecture was totally worthless. Almost the entire lecture revolted and went to the deans.,I took his class two semesters ago and I still hate him to this very day.  Whenever I think of him I see HELL.  i have random nightmares of being attacked by him on the engineering quad.  his beard is sharp and deadly.,This man is the single most discouraging thing I've encountered since coming here two years ago.  DO NOT register for his section by ANY means.  Maybe he's useful in a lab or something but he should NOT be teaching.  Took his time getting through chapters 1-3 then went through 2 chapters a week to finish the book.,He is the worst teacher I have ever had. DOnt be surprised if you get yelled at if you try to participate in class. Don't ever have him for a teacher. You will hate your life if you do.,RIDICULOUS,"It's just too bad you can't give zeros...take this professor at your own risk, but i highly recommend against it.

Only because of the professors attitude, he just always seemed to be into himself and not his students.",Avoid taking this class at all costs unless you want to be tortured for the semester! Chambers believes he is God's gift to advertising. Extremly pompous and does not care about his students only his researh and reputation. If you do not believe me then all you need to do is go the first class and you will know exactly what I am talking about.,"I don't know what you people are talking about. This class ruled. Dr chambers can only be described in one word: ballin. I mean the guy wears an expensive suit to class everyday and he is easy to understand. He's a tough grader on exams and quizes and it's a lot of work but it's also a fun class. If you can't handle it, you're in the wrong major","Avoid this class all together and spend your personal time creating a faux planbook for a time in yesteryear. He grades you on minute details and does not have any concern for any of his students. If you want to take it, get ready for the time, effort and potential gray hairs. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS CLASS AT ALL.","He is a horrible professor at such a fine institution, and grades you on the minute details that do not even matter. Also, he does not recognize the hard work and effort you put into your project. If you do have an interest in taking this course, take it by all means. The only thing useful is the plan book.","Very hard class.  Attendance is mandatory.  You are graded on a group project that really sucks.  He is very picky when grading the quizzes and exams that are mostly short answer/essay questions.  He is interesting and knows his stuff, but I don't think the content is worth the GPA drop.",VERY HARD CLASS.  Professor Chambers is very enthusiastic about his material and wrote one of the books for the class.  READING THE BOOKS IS PRETTY MUCH NECESSARY.  The tests were very hard.  Notecards help.  Information needed to learn must be details.  Don't take if you don't have to!  Lots of memorization and similar names to differentiate.

I loved going to his lectures because he is not only a great teacher but he can connect with his students very well.,He was amazing and knew how to explain things very well. His assignments and exams are to the point and very fair. Random short stories here and there keep the class awake and happy. Great guy!

In any case, I really liked Joan as a person, though she didn't always get papers graded on time.  She's also pretty harsh with comments, though I appreciate that.  I also appreciate that she's so committed to woman's studies and gender politics in general...  Real cutie.",TA is really down to earth and knowledgable. Joanne made material really digestible and made class really informative.  I'm planning to minor in women's studies because of Chris Mayo and Joanne.

Less reading than in other classes. .,"She talks fast, mumbles often and relies way too much on PPT.  This trio of choices drove many to their laptops to weather the bore-storm that was her 2+ hr ramblings.

But she's a stickler  for everything. Much of the work in class isn't interesting. She needs to rethink her curriculum. In essence: Type-A, uncaring professor who gives too many assignments and petty-projects and lectures for 2.5 hours equals 8 weeks of awfulness.","She's nice, knowledgable, and seems passionate about her subject. But, she talks fast, mumbles, reads every single word off the powerpoint, covers insignificant details most of the time, and can be pretty confusing. Everyone sat on their laptops most of the class. And it's a 3 credit course in 8 weeks, so you're there 2.5 hours 2x a week. Not fun.",SHE IS HORRIBLE!!!! She only read out the PPT and never really teach much! There are 60+pgs of PPT to read...yea i know...and talks about the jokes that only herself could understand...Overall the worst course I've taken so far. DON'T TAKE HER!!!!,"Issues:  when she lectures she is very quiet, she doesn't really care about students' opinion, she's a tough grader and doesn't like to give away her A's.  Overall her class was boring, uninteresting (I took the class b/c i thought it looked interesting) and I as well as everyone in her class ended up surfing the internet the whole time...","this is a horrible class. the lectures are about nothing relevant to stated objectives, she just reads off a piece of paper, and does so many little things which just bug me. awful class, awful professor"

He's looking to make you a better student he wants to see effort and improvement as well as knowledge.,"Jeff is a great professor! He explains everything really clearly, and you do not need the textbook at all! That being said, his tests are very difficult. I feel like he made this class unnecessarily hard for a first semester organic chemistry class, but I can't deny that he's very good at teaching.",Great professor. Clear lectures. Midterms very difficult.,Dr. Chan is extremely nice. I didn't do well after my first midterm and he took the time to personally e-mail me to send me words of encouragement.

She can come off a bit harsh, but sometimes brutal honesty is what we need as students.",Incredibly difficult to understand because she talks over herself so much. Ill also echo the previous comments that say shes super rude. She is. And she seems to have a problem with black and Hispanic students. Worst teacher I have ever had at UIUC.,Michelle was a very hard grader and honestly very rude. I do not recommend taking any discussions with her. She is very unclear with what she wants and your grade suffers because of it. Avoid she was my least favorite teacher I have had ever at the University.,"Extremely picky on what she wants, yet continues to change her expectations. It makes 0 sense. She spends more time talking about politics in class and it isn't a discussion, it's more of her just telling people what to think. She assigns lots of reading and a good amount of writing."

On the last day of class he was not able to explain in less than ten minutes where his office is so that we can turn in the final.  Keep in mind that he was using chalk and a blackboard as well.  I would not allow him to teach anything.  Also, he failed third grade for a reason.",I quite liked him. He did seem to cut off people and often got frustrated at people not understanding. He is obviously extremely intelligent. Just know that he takes philosophy seriously and his class will not be  blow off class.,"Hugh Chandler is a brilliant philosopher, great teacher, and amazing person overall. Anyone taking any of his classes should feel greatly honored.","Not a ""teaching"" style for everyone, but I would say he is an archetype for one kind of philosophy professor.  Regardless, he is clearly a kind, brilliant old (and odd) man, and a mind with any versatility would be well-served by taking one of his upper level courses (101 kids should have a playpen for lambasting those who spurn their illiteracy).","had him for metaphysics, and spoke with him often about other classes as well.  he's a great thinker and his style is very helpful (whether you know it or not).  it wouldn't be much of a phil class if he gave you exactly what he wanted to hear in a paper, would it?  the 101 kids plainly don't participate, and are uninterested in philosophy","Professor Chandler is one of the keenest minds at the University of Illinois.  Anyone serious about philosophy will learn vast amounts from him.  He is an incredibly giving person, as well.  The intro students who pan him don't know what is good for them.","Please, for your own benifit, do not have this professor!  He is ancient, I can barely understand him, .    He argues in circles and when you try to speak he interupts you, and it feels he does not listen to your ideas.","He is really scattered, but he gets the material across.

Don't ask him questions and don't go to his office hours.,"Compared to a lot of other professors in the IE department, his lecture slides are very thorough and informative. If you go through the lecture slides before the exam you should be okay. The exams can be long and time constricted but if you know the material well there should be no problem. He was very generous with a curve on the first exam.","I don't know why the previous raters didn't like Karthik so much. He was strict but was funny sometimes. He was a very fair professor. We had weekly homeworks that matched what we did in lecture well. The lectures he gave were good. Exams were very fair, you had to put in the time. I'm an average student imo, I ended up with an A in his class.",Excellent!,This professor does not show any respect to students. He does not encourage your answers during lectures. He has a VERY VERY strict policy about electronics so students cannot even take notes using tablets. VERY VERY BORING lectures and VERY VERY LONG AND TOUGH exams. But fortunately they will get curved.,"No cell phone no laptop during his lecture. Force his student to come to lecture else you would get very low grade on Class Participation, which drag you down from at least one letter grade. Confusing sometimes.

He did not care whether you actually learn the core algorithms. He is not willing to answer any homework questions and always give blur answer to the questions raised in class. No curve as well. Your grade depends on unreadable exams and a few homework,"This professor is one of the worst professors I've ever had. His complete disregard for students learning and insanely strict policies left me with no desire to learn the material.

Instead, he tested you on materials that he didn't taught. Definitely worst professor ever","Tough class, but perhaps the best one I have in college/grad school. Professor taught critical thinking and emphasized concepts. Questions discussed in class were intriguing and inspiring. Much reading. Heavy project. I would recommend!","Helpful and interesting lectures. Homework was heavy, but TA turptorials helped a lot. Generous grading with lots extra credits.",He is funny but he does not teach well. I will recommend that instead of going through quickly from slides better explain the concept and show how can you apply the concept to a small problem.  You are at your own to figure out stuff,"The materials were hard and he went through it way too fast. Homeworks took a lot of time, but you could get some help by attending the tutorial and the TA office hours. Exams were very tough, you would have to understand each concept to do well.

He's one of those teachers who wants you to work hard just to get a C, which then screws up your GPA. Avoid.","Class is absolutely terrible. Relies too much on TA's to teach and gives them little to go off of. Over 80 pages per week on average to read, shouldn't be a 100 level course. Avoid it if you can, take other classes that fill the requirement.","The attendance policy for this class is well too strict because even if you attend, you still may not get full points.

She seems like a nice woman, she just isn't a great teacher.","Although her lack of facility with English sometimes gets in the way, she really wants to help her students and appreciates if you visit her office hours. This is often better than asking a question during lecture, as she often does not understand questions from students right away.","Really struggles with answering students' questions.  Material itself is not that difficult, but I felt like I was completely teaching it to myself, even though I went to class every week.","Definitely NOT an engineering prof, nor does she make any claim to be.

Really difficult to understand, and she accused me of not going to lecture when I went to her office hours (when I had been to all of her lectures). I recommend signing up for her section and going to Zhang's lectures, so you benefit from his teaching and her class's curve. The distributions can be nearly a litter grade different.",OMG!!! you don't wanna take her class.,"She is a miserable excuse for someone that is supposed to teach. Her ""jeroes""(zeros) are a constant annoyance.  She consistently doesn't understand questions asked about lecture slides and one day a student spent 10 min. trying to getting his point across to her but he decided to leave because she still couldn't understand. Avoid her at all costs.","The material is clear if you follow along and understand the concepts. Don't expect her to clarify if you have questions. Her accent, pronunciations, and odd wording give you something to smile about, and she's not hard to understand after you get used to her.",Not very effective teacher. She used slides on the overhead for everything and it wasnt clear what we had to know or not. Some lectures we learned material we didnt even have to know.

He makes sure that everybody understands his lecture and all the doubts are cleared in class itself. I would advise everyone to take his class.,"I don't understand the previous review... Choi is a nice and interesting guy. He explains things quite clear, uses a lot of calculations and writes everything on board, like typical asian-style teaching. The tests were not too easy but you should do well as long as you attend class and do the homework. I enjoyed the class and learned a lot.","He transferred from Penn State, and has no clue what U of I FIN students know. I learned nothing about picking stocks from this class, so it was a total waste of time. The tests were hilariously easy, and the biweekly HW was just for credit.

Teaching not so effective. Never wanted to go to this class. However, attendance is mandatory for participation grade. Favorite part was the grading contract. You can pick how your grades will be weighted."

John is a really good guy and knows his stuff. He was always accessible and gave great feedback. Super understanding. 10 out of 10 would recommend","He is a great guy and I respect him as a professor. He is a sarcastic person who makes the lectures easy to get through and semi fun for someone who doesn't care for English classes.  Just do the work that he assigns, ask questions in class, and you will get an A.","He is a humorous professor.  His quizzes and tests are easy as long as you go over the PPTs and the handouts.  Feel free to go to his office hours and email him your draft, his advice is valuable and inspirational.","Very helpful, nice guy. He's also a 'merciful' (bordering on easy) grader, but seems to assign a lot of what I feel are 'petty' writing assignments in between major papers. He's funny and his class is entertaining.","Very manageable workload, read some excellent novels, would take the class again for sure. Discussions were always really interesting. He's the kind of instructor that gets students to talk - not the type that rambles about the novel for the whole hour. Great class","He is a very chill, funny guy. Really easy to talk to. He is also an awesome teacher and his poetry class is a lot of fun. If you pay attention it's easy.","Claborn is a good film teacher, and his material is usually pretty easy if you just go to lecture and listen.  Beware however he doesn't accept late work at all, nor is there such a thing as an excused absence even if your mom died or something.","His class seems like it might be hard at first, but it was easy and pretty fun.  He's a cool professor.  Just make sure you take decent notes and look them over before quizes and tests.  Go to most of the movie sessions.  B forsure, A is very possible."

Never saw or heard from the Professor. As long as you came to class/ turned things in mostly you did well. Didn't really learn much until the last two weeks. Undergrad assistant was really nice, &amp; there was EC, but never heard from Prof. Sort of felt like a half done curriculum.","A bit pompous and very self-referential. She barely taught any of the class. When you'd see her for extra credit office hours, she'd often complain about her students for not paying attention rather than making the class more engaging. Would often not help students either, instead spending time talking about how we're a burden.","ANTH 143 was super easy. However, it seemed like the TAs and UMs were more involved in the course than Dr. Clancy was. Regardless, the quizzes are easy &amp; untimed, the video response papers are easy if you answer the questions, and there's only three short papers throughout the entire course. You can earn 8% of your grade back through extra credit.","Her emails and her videos (which are a few because another professor does most of the online lectures) show how she is pretty much full of herself and does not care about her students.  Her PBL's and quizzes could be made simple, but the way she writes them are confusing and you feel unprepared even when you read the material thoroughly.",She was extremely specific about everything and don't even bother asking questions because she'll refer you to the syllabus every time. The PBL's took me HOURS upon HOURS. But! Extra credit is a thing in this class and take advantage of it.,"Every comment mentioning how condescending and rude she is? It's true.  I've never even met her in real life, but her few e-mails seep of how self-absorbed. She doesn't even give actual lectures, yet she still complains about how many students take this course. Half the online lectures are done by another professor!  Still an easy A, though.","What a poor excuse for a professor. Extra Credit sessions were basically ""office hours"" where she complains about how no one pays attention to her during lectures in the past. She cares nothing about the student and only enjoys talking about herself. No sympathy when emergencies occur. Please fire her and avoid her at all costs.",Easy A Gen Ed Course. Very little homework or exams. Highly Recommended.,Going to the class was not helpful at all. All the work is online and powerpoints and quizzes are more confusing than they need to be. I think this class could have been much more interesting.,The thing is that you never actually see in her in person. This class is taught by a UM and is very easy if you stay on top of all the homework and don't miss assignments. class is once a week and you can miss 2 so it's not a problem at all,"This class was stupid.Attendance was mandatory, but we rarely talked about anything useful. Everything else was online. Don't get me wrong this class was EASY. I got an A. But it required A LOT of reading &amp; taking notes on 3-5 lessons/readings PER WEEK. &amp; just when you decide to stop taking notes, she quizzes you on them. So take good notes.",It's an easy class if you do all of your assignments and go to the one hour discussion section once a week.,"To be honest, the class was really easy. As many earlier comments have mentioned, do all the assignments carefully and an A is guaranteed. The content is interesting and the course is very well outlined. However, the course seems very under-staffed. Assignments were graded weeks after the deadline, as there were 4 TA's (graders) and 750 students.","The class is very easy, its online so not much work. Do the assignmenst and you are sure to recieve an A! I liked the way the class was handled except the material was boring. Take it for an easy A. Oh and no exams so thats a definite plus, only projects which are not hard at all.",DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. Although it's blended and you barely see the professor she still manages to be extremely rude to her students.  She literally should be fired from this university for her unwillingness to discuss things with her students. She acts like it's a burden for her to teach you and you should bow down tot her greatness.,"Where do I begin? Honestly if you are taking the blended version of online and discussion, dont even think about it. I wanted to take this course thinking of minoring in anthro... this teacher completely swayed me the other way... The online stuff is so much reading and then the discussion has nothing to do with the material.. Dont take this class",This is the worst class I've taken. It's too bad because it is such an interesting subject. Discussion and the online portion don't really relate to each other. The professor talks down to you and sends a lot of negative emails/feedback. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS,"yeah...""You don't get it for just showing up. If you are belligerent or have no question, no points...But if you find this class a breeze and are getting an A+ or something, and you think you are just too darn good for office hours... it's ok if you don't clog the line and don't come. You likely don't need the points.""","LOVED this course. Going in, I barely knew what anthropology was. The blended course was fantastic. GO TO LECTURE. It's only once a week after all, but because of this: GO TO OFFICE HOURS. The UM's and TA's are fantastic. Prof. Clancy is very approachable and knowledgeable."

Fun discussions if you participate.","DEFINITELY not the class for you if you don't like writing... a response paper is due every Friday and there's a quiz on every reading, which means pretty much every day. Otherwise, it's an okay class but I hate writing... the exams are pretty fair as long as you read everything.","This class is rather hard because of the amount of writing involved, but she makes it more interesting and works with you to get everything right.

Notes provided only in class.","Overall, Professor Clark is an amazing teacher. He knows the material front and back and presents it in an easy manner. He is very organized. Quizzes and papers aren't graded that strictly. Only negative, the first 20 min/80min class spent recapping the last class. Very redundant.","Excellent, intelligent professor. Has the ability to deftly navigate the issues he teaches (can satisfactorily answer almost any question thrown at him) as well as the ability to handle periphery issues. Very organized. Straight-forward. No surprises. Also, it doesn't hurt that he's a handsome guy.","He gives a lot of hand outs.

So either pay attention and ask questions in discussion, or take Kwiat's lecture.",Best Professor I've ever had. Provides great insight into fundamental physics. I've never had a more exciting class!,"If you have the choice, take Kwiat instead. Get all of your learning done in the discussion sections because it wont happen in lecture with Clegg.

When I am in lecture I genuinely stay focused and try to understand the material, not just memorize it. He is one of the very few teachers who cares about their students and more importantly believes that they can succeed. He is a fantastic professor!!!!!!","Dr. Clegg is a very nice man, but an incredibly ineffective professor. His lectures are often incoherent, ambiguous and convoluted. He very frequently takes simple concepts and makes them very difficult to understand. The TAs in this class know almost nothing about the topic, and are incredibly difficult to work with.","Dr. Clegg is an outstanding professor and a great person. His class is well run, and he prepares you well for his exams through his learning targets/ objectives. You can tell he is a genuine person, that cares about his students, and has a passion for education. He has really accessible office hours as well.","Genuinely good professor and person overall. I only struggle in his class because my high school did a poor job of teaching me the material we were supposed to know prior to this class. However, he does provide you with plenty of resources if this is the case.","Very knowledgable professor. Show up to lecture and do all assignments and you'll be fine. Seemed a little department driven, as if he were simply going off a script. He's very clear about what will be on exams, no curveballs","Dr. Clegg is one of the best professors I have had. He is very passionate about teaching and biology, which made me excited to come to lectures. The way he structures his class allows you to actually understand the material, instead of just memorizing facts. Overall, Dr. Clegg genuinely cares about his students both academically and personally.",Professor Clegg is one of those professors who really cares for your success. His lectures are mandatory but they help a lot. He talks fast sometimes but it's just because he is super passionate about biology. His course demands that you put work outside of class if you want to receive a good grade. He's also hard to catch during office hours.,"He's great one on one but he kind of sucks if you only go to lectures. If you meet him for office hours or take it JS like I did, you'll love him. He's very caring and wants to see you succeed, he's not just there for his own research.","Dr. Clegg is an amazing professor who is really passionate about the course that he teaches. The course was very well structured. Although the course mainly covers basic biology topics taught in high school, lectures are still really interesting and the questions he asks in lectures makes you think about these topics from a different perspective.",Clegg will be a professor I will remember forever because he genuinely cares about his students. IB 150 is a decently tough class but he makes it more bearable. He gives a lot of extra credit and gets excited when students do well on tests. Highly recommend taking any classes with Clegg,"Professor Clegg is a really great teacher, and it's obvious that he cares about all his students. He's super enthusiastic about biology, and can give good explanations to any questions you may have. The class isn't easy, but there is a lot of extra credit given, and you get a lot of points just for showing up to class. Overall, a solid professor.","Professor Clegg is amazing, he takes time for every student that needs it. He is one of the rare few that actually cares about every single student's success. If you get a chance to take the James Scholar section, do it, because the Professor teaches your discussion section. I can't emphasize enough how good of a teacher he is.","Great teacher and really shows that he cares about his students. Willing to meet with you outside of office hours if you need extra help. Gives tons of extra credit to help boost grades. Exams are hard but he makes it clear what he expects to be known. Be ready to put in work, though!","Did not really learn anything new in this class. If you have an AP Bio background, you are basically set to breeze through the course. I did not particularly like the way lectures and discussions were set up, but they were not the death of me, either. Just be sure to do the practice exams and go over the learning objectives/goals before each exam.","IB150 is in fact the easiest one comparing to all the other MCB courses I have taken. If you have taken AP biology or other bio courses in high school this course should not be a problem. Plus, even if you already know most of the knowledge you could still gain something new as he uses interesting examples. His learning strategies are great!","Ben Clegg is not a good professor at all. His lectures are very boring and make no sense. This unit, I did not attend a single lecture and still did well on the exam. The one time I went to lecture, I did not get anything out of it and left like it was a waste of my time. He does a terrible job at explaining concepts.","IB 150 is supposed to be the easiest bio ever, but it did not feel that way. I put in so much work, did all the EC/HW/readings, and studied like crazy to end up with an A-. He was good, but his TA's aren't the best. The set-up of the course is also irritating. He himself is a good and knowledgable guy nonetheless.","Professor Clegg is the most caring professor I have even had. He gives so many opportunities for success in his class. To get a good grade show up to lectures to receive clicker points, do all of the homework because it is a huge chunk of the grade, and go to TA office hours.","Prof. Clegg is an excellent lecturer who tries to make learning the material as interesting as possible, but his lecture activities can sometimes be hard to follow. The exams are pretty difficult, but there is a lot of padding and extra credit and a nice resurrection policy. I got Cs on my first 2 exams and managed to get an A in the course.","I'm really glad to have had him this semester, he's a pretty good professor. Despite the huge lecture size, he does a good job of making it seem smaller. Additionally, the exams for this class are application-based and can be somewhat difficult; however, there's lots of extra credit and resources to get help. Overall, I'd definitely recommend him."

He is a very famous researcher in the psychology world but still is passionate about teaching.  The class is always interesting and the grading is fair and generous.  Take this class.,He is very charming and very smart! He is good looking and humorous as well.  He is also a gentleman and I recommend you to meet him.,"Great professor.  Brilliant guy, lectures were always fun to attend.  Great integration of Hollywood films with real cases.  Would definitely recommend!",This class is very interesting.  A look into amnesia using hollywood films.  The professor is very intelligent and explains concepts well.  Would recommend taking this class.,No Comments,outstanding professor.  had him over 10 years ago and still apply information gained from him.,He's incredibly intelligent and still managed to make the topic interesting and understandable.  A great class.,Huge tool box in class.  Pretty easy test tho.,The class taught me a lot and got me even more interested in the subject.  The prof had a wealth of cool information and his grading was very fair.
731443,3.0,Dov,Cohen,19,0.4001876804710561,"Professor Cohen conducts the worst lecture I have ever experienced. He does not use any lecture notes/slides, just talks AT you for 2 hours straight. His lectures make no sense and follow no guidelines. The exam questions are about specific examples he vaguely mentions in class. Thank god for the TA's during lab who try to teach us everything.",He is so weird. His lecture make no sense and are incredibly unorganized. His tests come directly from his crazy lectures and he asks questions that have nothing to do with psychology at all. Even his TA's were confused about some of the test questions. Do not take him if you don't have to.,"This professor is respected by the department therefore, will probably never actually take any constructive feedback seriously. This professors teaching style is insulting. He does not speak clear or concisely. The midterm/final average this fall was between a 58-60 how is that okay? Tests are on lecture/reading which he RARELY explains during clas",Great class. Super interesting. Would reccomend!,"There's 3 group projects in lab and 2 tests. The projects in lab are pretty easy and most of them are done in class, but the lectures are disorganized. He seems like he's very knowledgable on the subject but comes unprepared- he just talks the whole time. You basically have to try and write down every single thing he says. Tests are REALLYYY hard.","worst class i have ever taken; he is very knowledgable but the class is so disorganized and you are expected to do poorly; the exams are near impossible and cover material that we never even learned; strongly advise against taking this class; attendance isn't mandatory but if you do not attend, consider yourself extra screwed.","He was never organized, never made clear points, and projected a 70% average on the first exam. Thanks for setting your students up for failure. Dude should be a philosophy professor or something but not a 4 credit lab course professsor. I don't even know what I learned in this class. Avoid him.","You have to pay attention in lecture. He doesn't put them on compass but he's great at explaining things if you don't understand. The exams are challenging (2) but the papers help boost your grade. He does pop quizzes on lecture material.  I had Pete Ondish as a TA. Really nice. Only critique is being in class for 2 hours, 3 times a week is a pain.","The class wasn't very enjoyable and I'm not certain that I learned too much. The lectures can be entertaining at times but are overall boring and confusing. His tests are confusing. I got an A but like I said, didn't learn much.","Lectures are boring and pointless. He often goes on random tangents. That said, the class is relatively easy if you put the work into the papers. If Kay Wallheimer is still a TA, I'd strongly recommend going for her, she rocks. No exams (and pop quizzes only if nobody participates). It's mostly essays and group projects.",Lab sections gave easy and fair assignments. Lectures with Cohen were sometimes pointless and boring. Participate in class and you won't have any major tests or assignments. Just papers.,Total space cadet.,"Best of the three lecturers, by far.  Really great teaching style, very interesting to listen to.",Just go to lecture.  I didnt read the book at all and did well.  Just go to class and you'll do very well.  The other teacher's in this 3-teacher course are not nearly as good as Dov.  He will help boost the grade.,He was really fun to listen to talk because he was so laid back. His teaching style is awesome and i really wish he taught the whole semester. The tests are easy if you go to lecture.,His unit was great.  Just go to the lectures and read the stuff and you will get an A.  Reading is not that much.,"This is the best teacher I have had in college so far. Teachers should take notes from him because he makes you want to go to class and learn the material. Tests are not difficult if you go to lecture. The only complaint I have is that he does not teach the entire semster, which he should because he kicks that much butt.",Overall interesting topics...but vague in lecture.  No concrete notes.  Lots of out of class reading that he does not even mention in class.,"This guy is such a great teacher.  His lectures are very laid back and he is so interesting that he just teaches as if he's having a conversation with everyone. A teacher that makes you want to come to class even when that's the last thing you want to do. there are two books to read, but they arey short and easy."

2308850,3.0,Cassandra,Colbert,1,0.28898930498369646,"So instead of meeting twice a week she cut it to once a week. This is just a course to explore your interests and figure out what you want to do. No clear syllabus, usually subject to change anyway. it seemed like a lot of busy work but i'm sure its helpful to other students. Shes very nice and approachable. Big sports fan."

You can really tell she knows her stuff, and she goes out of her way to make LING 100 accessible to everybody. Highly recommended, especially if you need a gen-ed.",Nice teacher. Nice teamwork teaching method. Quizzes are easy and you get bonus points from group quiz. The midterm and the final are also group-based. Easy A. Take this class.,"Take LING 100 if you need an easy Gen Ed! I was already a little interested in linguistics prior to this class, but now I have decided to minor in it. The final is optional if you do well on everything else-- go to class and you will learn a lot. She is very good at explaining the material.","Ling 100 is SUPER easy. Take it if you want an easy gen ed AND you are at least somewhat interested in linguistics, 'cause otherwise it might be boring for you. She keeps the class as interesting as you are interested in the topics.",A poor and disorganized instructor. VERY mean. Be careful!,"One of the best professors I've ever had. Teaches well, answers questions well, keeps all material relevant. Clearly cares about students. If you want an A, you do have to earn it, but if you like problem/puzzle-solving, have no worries. Anyway, I wholeheartedly recommend this class.","A little bad on time management, many times failed to finish going over her slides before the bell rang and told us to go over them ourselves online. No one ever came to discussion except maybe me and four other people. Easy exams and homework.","Very boring. Not personable at all, and get very annoyed when she was asked a lot of questions. Homeworks were HARD and the TAs graded very unfairly.","Jennifer cole is a robot, except she has no brains.",total waste of time. prof was very unorganized. most of the times she was sleepy. but an easy A.,"useless class, very incompetent professor. grad students know better than her. wonder if she has read anything after 1960. also, very undemocratic lady.",Boring Ass Class and totally lost instructor! I doubt if she reads the articles she assigns for her class.,"On numerous occasions I watched students help her out of a teaching jam. She was totally lost on several articles that she attempted to clarify. Smiled like an ass while several students pulled her out of her jam. Easy A, but then again it was a graduate course. Look into the psych department for more useful and interesting linguistics courses.","Great instructor; homework was challenging but really helpful for learning the material.  Lectures were thought-provoking and not just a repetition of the course readings.  Extremely intelligent and well-read in many areas outside her discipline, but not arrogant or condescending.  I've had several classes with her and they've all been excellent.","Helpful, but terrible subject",She knows her stuff. I usually try to throw a couple curveball questions at profs when I know the subject matter pretty well. She got my question on the langual nerve passage right on.,pretty good prof,"fairly good teacher, her class isn't the easiest but she makes it as entertaining as...possible","Shes super smart, knowledgable in ALL areas of discussion. Very clear.",No Comments
974239,1.8,Howard,Cole,7,0.25438483273463625,"Worst class that I have taken in my college career. Teacher rambles endlessly, often times about things not even related to the topic. Test are hard to prepare because there is no sort of guide, and grading is very subjective. Even though attendance is required, your better off learning off of cliffnotes. Do Not Recommend!","One of the worst classes I've taken. Cole is a nice guy, and he knows his Shakespeare well, but a terrible teacher! The class set up is a disorganized mess, grading is extremely subjective and unstructured, and class is boring and not the slightest bit interactive. Was frustrated with this class all semester and would never take it again.","A terrible waste of my time, boring and frustrating. The material was presented in the most uninteresting fashion, focus on rote memorization and petty insights that must align with the Professor's canonical beliefs.","Poor class interaction. He rambles endlessly, and does not seem to comprehend simple student questions. Not helpful, even if you see him in office hours. Papers have letter grades only, no comments. He knows his Shakespeare, but does nothing to increase class understanding. Makes obscure references to works we have not read. Learned NOTHING!",RAMBLES in class.Tests are random and hard to prepare for. Poorly answers questions inside and out of class,"Tons of fun, adorable old man.  Does tend to ramble a bit about his own life, but has invaluable insights about Shakespeare and is extremely fair when it comes to exams and grading. TAKE HIS CLASS!","Lovely guy, bad teacher. Prepare to hear about his grandkids and WW2 instead of learning anything about Shakespeare. Summarizes more than explains. No need to be in class; use sparknotes and you have replaced his teaching.  Midterm question (this never changes): How does Shakespeare make drama out of continuing success?"
1444323,4.3,Cheryl,Cole,12,0.7210664295654224,The lectures are interesting and she's a very friendly person. She takes a while to respond to emails and can be a little unclear about assignment requirements.,"Professor Cole is a lot of fun and a really good teacher. She says she's a big fan of mental health, so gives you A LOT of time to work on papers. Is a really lenient grader, and cancels class a lot. Super easy A - I will literally end this class with a 100%. I still learned a lot though.","Cole is a very good professor. The class size was not very conducive to the discussion-based nature the course needed, but Cole made it work very well. Excellent choice for an entry-level course and professor. As long as you have some idea what is happening, you should get an A fairly easily.",This class was really wonderful. I felt like I learned a lot and was engaged the majority of the time. Professor Cole is a huge fan of mental health which makes the class pretty easy to handle. She's incredibly understanding and really cares about us as individuals. I'm actually planning on taking another course with her next semester!,"I'm only 7 weeks into my freshman year, and I know I don't have a lot of experience with professors yet, but she is literally amazing. CoM student or not, take one of her classes esp a MACS class. You'll love it, fun real word experience, easy, easy grader, not a lot of work. Love her!",Fantastic teacher and class - Without this class I would not have experienced the wonderful fine art opportunities this university offers since I am in the college of LAS,She is great! I learned a lot from this class and she's super interesting. I liked her a lot especially because she brought in awesome guest speakers. I usually went to her class because it was actually cool and interesting.,"SUCH a great teacher and class! Recommended for anyone, not just College of Media students. She makes everything clear and she's very understanding. She also gives great extra credit to bring up your grade. There's a big project at the end but it's really interesting.",shes awesome,Prof. Cole is awesome! She's very understanding and is very helpful with any questions you have. She relates with students and makes the class as easy for you as possible. As long as you pay attention and participate in discussion and know whats going on in the readings the exams are a piece of cake.,"Great teacher, keeps us interested, and makes big assignments/projects fun by making them very open-ended!  She's helpful, knowledgeable, and challenging, but not impossibly so.  Definitely going to take another class from Professor Cole!","What an awesome, fantastic professor. We designed our own research projects and each class was a fascinating, intellectually challenging class where I learned a lot. It definitely was challenging though, I considered dropping the course several times. Definitely taking a class with Cole again!"

Apparently submitting your contribution to a group project late, but still before the deadline, is good enough reason to take off nearly 50% of it.  Responses to grading question were unhelpful","Easy A as long as you do the homework assignments and two posts each week. There are two tests, not cumulative. Very specific questions, but as long as you carefully review the lectures, they aren't too bad.","1-2 HWs due a week, questions straight from the readings/lectures. Two posts 1-2 sentences due a week. For exams I just took all the bulletpoints from each lecture and studied those the night before and the day of the exams, both exams multiple choice &amp; neither are cumu (although you might want to study more bc they're a little specific).
