From my experience, I wouldn't take another class with him.",Very nice guy.  Teaches the material in a very organized manner.  Go to lecture and you'll be fine.  Tests were WAY easier than the homework.  He prepares you very well.,"He does have a strong accent, and he sometime mumbles, but overall he is a good teacher.

I would even take a French poetry course with her!","I like this teacher a lot. She is actually from France, so she is very knowledgeable.

If you work hard throughout the semester and do well aggregately, one test should not be reflective of a final grade. In this case, it seemed that way. Plenty more good classes in the ACES department much more worth your time and energy.","This class is 72 percent test, so if you don't do well with test you might have a little trouble. Overall the class isn't terrible, she offers her own book to the class for free online. She does offer old test, some are really close to the test some aren't close so don't always bank on that.","Professor Mallory is a decent teacher, once you get used to her way of doing things. She gives out extra credit, as well as providing students with plenty of ways to learn the material, including online lectures on Compass. Her tests are moderately difficult. I would recommend that you take ACE-427 with her, you'll learn a lot.","Good Class, good teacher. Go to lectures in the Computer Lab and read the online textbook. You'll easily pass","When i took ace427, it was mallorys first time teaching the course. She really cares about her class and tailors her teaching to her students. Very fair grader.

You think you know what your doing until you get a D on your lab report. Grading criteria is not clear whatsoever. Material is complicated. If you're looking for MCB lab requirement, look elsewhere. terrible teacher, you will struggle. explain fundamental concepts unclearly because he ""wants you to come up w/ the answer""","I think Carl is an overall horrible teacher. He doesn't explain things well at all, and the class is very very very unorganized. There is no clear grading systems and for the most of the labs, I feel had easy concepts with much too complicated procedures that are hard to follow. The quizzes aren't too bad but Carl's explanation are just bad.",He has good intentions but is actually impossible to follow at times.

Easy A.","Manalansan was very understanding and approachable during the online course I took. I missed a quiz the first week because I hadn't expected one due the first Wednesday, and I emailed him and he extended the due date. His tests and assignments were very reasonable and manageable.

Always seems mad in class but nicer if you speak to him in person.  Easy assignments and exams.

Patient and a great sense of humor.  Treats students as intellectuals and fosters safe class discussions.,"Incredibly condescending during lectures...Class was easy, but lectures were boring and not on target with readings","i took this as an undergrad.  it was an easy A but a waste of time.  he assigns you a ton of books.  you have to buy all of them but dont have to read them to be able to write the papers. for a 4 hour class, its an easy A. my roomie &amp;i switched off going to class bc it was so boring.  hes really into talking about The Senses but lets u out early.",Good teacher.,He is very inspiring and a chili pepper.,"Awesome Class, why doesnt he teach AAS 109 anymore, i need that for my gen ed","Awesome teacher. fun to listen to, his comments in class alone are reason enough to go. test are extremely easy if you just show up to class.","Easiest teacher ever. Plenty of extra credit. Notes aren't online, but as long as you attend class it should be an easy A.","Great teacher!!!  Take any class with him, and you'll enjoy it!","By far, the easiest class I have taken at the university.  The midterm and final took 15 minutes, and the questions were taken directly from the lecture notes.  The class is scheudled for and hour and twenty minutes, but he ends lecture after 45 minutes.

She would often schedule a conflict exam so that was dope. I was flagged for plagiarism like whaaa? I hate TA's, but outside of that great class I managed a B with all the adversity going on.","The previous comment is spot-on. Joanne expected the TA to lecture, however, they had not taken a similar course prior. Thus, she made videos to limit the time she needed to spend inside of the classroom. When she did stay, she showed irrelevant videos that wasted time and left without answering questions. Her videos lectures were pointless...","Interesting course, Joanne loves the material and it comes across in her teaching.","Great teacher! This class was very hard, demanding, with memorization galore but well worth it especially for those going into medicine. You'll have to study really hard for quizzes and exams for this 2 hour course, however, you will learn a lot.  Joanne is funny and easygoing.  It's not easy to pull off an A, but I studied hard and did.  Good Luck",No Comments,Great class.  Learned a lot about basic cell culture techniques.

He puts undue stress on students and isn't always a fair grader.",No Comments,No Comments,Dr. Manfredo is very demanding of his students because he's extremely connected to the music world and it reflects back on him but this aspect sometimes overshadows his ability to be fair.

529888,4.3,Aldo,Manfroi,58,0.5756837575317708,I honestly can't think of anything about this class I didn't like. He balances a chill environment with actually teaching the material well. Plenty of opportunities to ask questions are given and he genuinely cares that people understand. His office hours are flexible and he lets students set up appointments if they can't make the set hours.,The best professor I've had at UIUC.,He is the great professor on this land. He is hilarious and loves all of his students and makes the class really enjoyable and easy. His practice exams are the only thing you need to get an A in the class,"Definitely need to show up for class, but he let us out early 90% of the time. He is hilarious and I would take him again for sure.","I had the worst time with this professor for 115.  He was never organized, terrible at explaining and he made up his own math problems! sometimes the solutions wouldn't make sense and it didn't help me learn the material at all.  I spent the entire semester teaching myself from the book.  AVOID HIM AT ALL COSTS",Loves students and enjoys answering questions and listening to us,"Manfroi is great. He's funny, understanding, and explains things very clearly. His grading scale is also very lenient. Definitely take diffeq with him if you have the opportunity.","Aldo is a wonderful person. He makes office hours if you cannot make his. He is entertaining, friendly, and caring. however, his lectures are too fast and he writes lightly. It is very hard to follow along. His practice exams are honestly the only thing I used to study for exams.","Professor Manfroi is one of the best professors I've come across at UIUC.  He not only is a great teacher, but he also has an amazing sense of humor.  He is very organized when teaching and his explanations are quite clear.  I honestly don't think there is a better choice for a MATH285 professor than Manfroi.  He is extremely helpful.  Take him!!!","This is my first  semester on this campus. It is so great to have a considerate professor like him. He is easy-going, which means you can talk about things beyond math with him. His lecture is helpful and clear. He will teach some useful little tricks which are very important in Math. He is considerate, but you have to learn your own things.","This can be a challenging class but if you attend his lectures regularly, take notes during his exam review sessions and do the practice exams, you will do great in his class. He sticks to the textbook most of the time. First midterm was a breeze but then they do get progressively harder. The final was comprehensive but doable.","Its not as easy as people say it is. First exam is just like the practice (Easy A). For the next 3, pay close attention and remember the tricks. I would do the practice exams as well as reviewing the homeworks as I'd say I usually did worse than I thought I would just doing the practice exams. Small mistakes will cost you a lot of points!!","Most engaging teacher I have taken at U of I. He loves his students, he loves to teach, and he makes sure everyone is on the same page. He gives many opportunities to get a good grade in his course. If you are taking math 285, take Manfroi without a doubt.","Great, engaging professor. One of the best math teachers at UIUC.","He is, by far, the man for MATH 285.","By far the number one professor you want for Math 285. Tests are super simple if you go to lecture (no tricks, very straightforward.) Also, he is a cool guy who tries to make dull material not to boring, and you can definitely tell he knows the material inside and out. TAKE 285 WITH HIM!",285 is not difficult conceptually but the way the tests are setup it's easy to lose a substantial amount of points over simple mistakes. If I could do it again I probably would have taken it with a different teacher - I'm better at beating a curve than I am at not making algebra mistakes. Nice guy though.,"Easiest Math I have ever taken in U of I. 3 midterms 1 final, the worst one will be 5%. Tests are same as the homework, as long as you do the homework, which is worth 20%, you will be ready for the test. I will take his class again if he offers any other classes.","Best math professor I've had at U of I.  Very clear explanations and examples with some humor thrown in.  The material isn't the easiest, but do the recommended hw and practice exams and you should do well.  Worst exam is only 5% of your grade, so if you do well on the 3 midterms you won't have to take the final.",He is super good. He explains super well and is pretty funny. Make sure to take good notes during class because he goes through all the types of problems you need to know very carefully.

Death and Dying is a must take course, and Tonya is the #1 reason to take it. She's given me hugs on bad days before, and I love her to death. You will too.","Tonya is absolutely wonderful! She is kind hearted and so passionate and knowledgeable about this topic. The responses and papers are easy and she basically gives you a 100 as long as you do it. The tests are open book, but fairly tricky so be sure to do readings!","Dear goodness this woman is a gem. I'm a somewhat recent BSW alum and was disheartened to see Tonya only having 3 reviews so here I am. Go take human development and if it's your thing, she teaches a course ""Death and Dying"" too. Incredible woman, amazing stories, and so many times I thought I was gonna pee myself from laughing so hard. 10/10","Best professor with the kindest heart! If you have her for ANY course she offers, make sure to take it!!","Tonya is great! She is very sarcastic and her lecture is full of humor. You'll wish she was your grandma. The class is easy. You do need to participate (15 times), there are quizzes, a group project and a paper, but I promise it's an easy A.

That being said, you should want to take the course with Spencer or Marcinkowski. Matt is a great guy who truly wants everyone to get an A in his class. He will usually tell the class EXACTLY what problems are on the exams, so there is no excuse if you do poorly.",He cares about his students. Super helpful in office hours although he can seem really mean in class at the start of the semester. Honest and straightforward about what to expect for exams. Just be prepared for class and you can get a lot out of his lectures. I feel like I would have missed out if I had taken this class with anyone else.,"Personally I really enjoyed my experience in Professor Marcinkowski's class. I was really struggling at the beginning and he helped me get a great grade towards the end by constantly working with me during office hours. He truly cares about you doing well, but it's up to the student to make the initiative. Take him!!!","He's the best professor since I joined uiuc for master degree. Always ready to help and explain even if you asked him the same question many times. He put 15% on pop quizzes, but he will help you to do it in class if you couldn't just raise your hand and ask him for help.  the lectures are heavy so you have to read a lot and practice.",The best . Ask him any Questions you want. Ask him the same question for million times. He won't leave the class until your Doubt is Clear.,He's a very fair professor. Homework isn't bad if you read the textbook. His midterm and final are similar to the practice problems he posts. Show up every day for popquizzes. His lectures are helpful. Projects are hard though make sure you start ahead of time and pair up with people who really know finance and you should be fine in his class.,"I had an A- up till the final, which counts 25% of the final grade. Unfortunately I missed the final, which is my bad. But I was not given a make up final even he another final two days later and I was OK to have penalty points taken off. I had to withdraw from it otherwise I would end up with a D+. He also refused to sign my withdrawal form.",Midterms and final (besides the second midterm) are very similar to previous ones.  Practice a lot on the homework before officially taking it (although the homework system has so many problems).  The only part where your grade will suffer is the group projects.  You need someone who really understands finance  to write a good report.,"Hard class but if you practice very hard before exam and have a genius in your group for projects, then you'll be fine.","The hardest part about this class would have to be the projects.  Good grades were not given out as often as one would have hoped.  Exam averages ranged from Bs on some exams, to Fs on others.  If you go to his office hours, he will like you a lot more and be willing to treat you nicely in class.  (Something that shouldn't be taken for granted.)","Loved the material and the way he taught class.  The exams were a different story.  There is no partial credit, so A exams easily turned into C's.  He had an awful day for office hours, and old exams almost never came with answers or solutions.  I loved Waspi's office hours, which got me A+'s on the homework. Do not take with Matt. Wait for Waspi!!","Took this class and got one of the few A's he handed out in this course. The test style is stupid because they are graded on answers meaning you could have the process right, mess up a small mathematical step an get the entire question wrong. He's helpful with projects but overall I hated his class and would not take it again with him for the life of me.",I graduated from Illinois this year and I must say he is the best teacher I have had. Extremely clear and very to the point. You get what you expect with this guy. He is flexible with his office hours and is there as and when you need help. Highly recommend him!,"I'm about to wrap up this class. First off, I wouldn't recommend taking it unless you have to. Second, don't take it with this guy. His accent is heavy, he's hard to understand, doesn't hand out extra credit like other teachers, and is a bad teacher overall. His midterms are hard, quizzes are difficult, not a good teacher. Do not take him.","Ditto the comment below. I'd recommend Waspi, he's the man. Took him, did my homework, studied, got an A-. He's a great teacher. Oltheten's hard as well.","I took this class 2 years ago and am now a masters student in finance who is a teaching assistant for Marcinkowski. Although his class was easy, he restructured his class for next fall and is going to make it significantly harder. He will follow the teaching syllabus of professor Jackson who recently left and will have pop quizzes,and much more hw","People try to make FIN 300 out to be harder than it is. If you put in the time studying the old tests, there is no excuse not to walk out with an A. Marcinkowski is an excellent teacher who will be frank with you about what is and isn't important. I liked him so much I'm taking him again for FIN 321","Definitely the best professor for Fin 300. Exams are just old exams with different numbers. Pop Quizzes are group quizzes and aren't tough. Don't buy textbook, you only use the lecture notes. He is always available to help and a funny guy.",Best of the bunch - take him for FIN300.,This teacher was amazing. He has kind of a heavy accent so it makes it funny to listen to him and he cracks the occasional joke here or there.

Questions on the exams weren't clear and there were multiple mistakes on every exam. Not a lot of extra credit were given out like when professor clegg was teaching. 1 lowest exam score was dropped, but I prefer the extra credit","As an MCB major, taking this class was supposed to be very easy. The content itself was easy, but the way it was presented was very confusing. Questions often had arguable answers and, I can't say this for all TA's, but mine was a nit pickey grader on simple assignments. The class isn't hard, per say, but it was very disorganized and frustrating.",He is a very clear and energetic speaker.,"I enjoy Jon's class. He wants people to do well, and he is awesome if you go to office hours.  He is very accommodating.  The hardest part is the tricky questions on the exams, but they're not too bad if you know the information from lectures. READ THE BOOK","Marcot genuinely wants all of his students to do well. He keeps lecture interesting, and if you go through the Unit Objectives before every exam there is no reason to not get at least a B. Admittedly, he does pose some strangely worded question. However, they aren't impossible question. He is just trying to make you think instead of memorize.","His lectures are very interesting. He uses powerpoints and plays videos, is passionate about what he does and really tries to help students to understand the material. The exams are another story though. The wording is weird and I can never do well on them, but I guess with the right studying technique, an A is possible.","The class is so easy but the lectures are boring. One main idea per lecture and that's it. However the class requires some work: a lot of things due all the time such as prelecture quizes, online homework, prep page before every discussion section...It can get kinda annoying but you can get an A in the class because the material is not that hard",Marcot keeps the interest level high and and fairly explains the  material. However he words the test very difficult and that will be your biggest problem in his class.,he was good at explaining topics but he was always rushing through things so we never had any time to process material. his 6 midterm exams killed my grade but the final was much easier than i expected. lots of studying for anyone in a non-science major,Lectures are interesting.  He takes random facts from the lectures and asks them over and over again in the tests.  Know your stuff and you'll be fine.,His lectures are pretty interesting and the assignments and pre-lecture quizzes are easy. There was a semester-long group project but it wasn't too bad. But his tests are what killed me. I could never get an A on them no matter what I did. It seemed like every answer could be right! But interesting material and I learned a lot!,"Marcot gives a fairly interesting lecture. He can hold attention well. He isn't always the most clear, but that could also be due to subject matter. He isn't the most helpful and will likely refer you to a TA if you ask for help. Students frequently complained about the difficulty of his tests. He words them very poorly making them confusing.","Marcot's lectures move very quickly. He rushed through all of his iClicker questions, giving us barely enough time to answer them. His tests are poorly written questions can be worded weirdly. However, the TAs are awesome and he drops the lowest test score. Not a terrible class, tolerable.","This class is pretty easy, yet really boring. Would not take it if I did not have to. There are weekly homework assignments. 6 tests and a project. Marcot definitely cares about his students. Really good TA's.","Really good prof, cares about student success and tries hard to make it make sense to them. He also has really good TA's. By far one of the best classes on campus.","Awesome prof, way better than MCB 150! If you took bio in high school, you should do well. He's good at explaining material and the tests (bi-weekly) are really simple if you know what he tells you to know.","Jon is nothing to rave about. But it really wasn't that bad. Tests are all multiple choice and quite easy if you go to lecture, which you should because of the I-Clicker extra credit points that are basically spoon-fed to students. Take notes, go to discussion, and do well on the tests. Jon is kind of condescending, but whatever... Easy A.","Not a very hard class, but it always helps to have prior knowledge. He explained everything very clearly and well. It has been my favorite class this semester. Readings were very easy.","Taking this class after MCB 150 was a cake walk. I already knew almost everything that he went over. I found his way of lecturing to be rather boring but his exams were fair. He does a lot of i-clicker questions which I liked because it gave us credit for going to lecture. Overall, this was an easy A but not very interesting.","Overall an interesting, enjoyable class. Lectures heavily emphasize iClicker questions. Marcot is a great lecturer and connects the content to main ideas. Discussion sections are pointless, tests aren't too bad (but do require studying), and there's plenty of extra credit at the end."

I didn't do any reading and still got an A because I got all the answers to her tests in the lecture. She doesn't care about the little details like when it's built but rather the big picture and that's what her tests are based on.

In short, DO NOT TAKE ANY OF HER CLASSES!",She made the class more difficult then EVER. She's insanely passionate about arch. history and goes through lectures VERY VERY fast. Her tests are difficult and she grades very hard. I was a sophomore in studios and this was my hardest class because of her. Her study guides for the tests are useless. I do not suggest taking any classes with her.,"I took Professor Marina for Arch 210 (see below), and Arch 412 is much more difficult- mainly because she ignores the rational behind the class numbering in the arch department.  At any rate, prepare to write a lot more than the three or four specified papers in the syllabus; several lengthy assignments are hidden in the enormous term project.",talks very fast. expects lots of reading and note taking.,"Professor Marina is very clear about her expectations and is truly focused on conveying her vast knowledge of architectural history to her students.  I always looked forward to attending class, and felt the readings and discussions were not only vital to class success, but insightful as well.",worst professor/teacher i have ever had..don't take this class no matter what you will regret it...i can't even describe how awful a class it is,boring and ****y.,No Comments

I have to admit that I am a victim in his class with great effort put in but no accordingly response or evaluation received from him.,This professor is a pretty awful public speaker himself. He comes to each class clearly unorganized and grades outlines that we turn in completely unfairly/nonsensically. He expects us to compose cookie-cutter speeches that obstructs us from developing our own unique diction. The only positive aspect I can say is that there is minimal homework.

This class requires a lot of work, but if you do all assignments diligently (make sure to check and follow all instructions), you would have no problem getting A in this class.","Class contents are a little dry,  but he's always cracking jokes. Very active on class news groups. One of my favorite professors.",great professor. cares about students. learned a lot in his class.,Worst teacher I have ever had. Tons of meaningless repetitive tedious projects.,"Responds to piazza and emails significantly faster than any other professor. He may not bring the most excitement to a class, but you can definitely tell he cares about his students.","Professor Marinov is very helpful, explains the material clearly and reflects on his experience in the field. Exams contains trick questions especially from the terms rarely used or confusing. Course material is shallow but breadth wide across all of SW Engineering. Project and HW are ok from load perspective. TA's are extremely helpful.",Professor is very helpful. Replies to email immediately. Explains the subject and reflects on his own experience. TA's are extremely helpful and supportive. Project and homeworks are relevant to course topics,Funny and badass mad scientist. Knows his stuff. Also helpful; sometimes shows up at study groups.

Not open to differing opinions. Very teacher centered, lecture based class style.","Expects everyone to agree with his own opinion of TBLT, although told we should formulate our own opinions on the subject.",Will not be very helpful if he feels that you disagree with his views on Task-Based Language Teaching.  Tells you to form your own opinion then expects you to agree with his!  Expects everyone to adopt his teaching methodology.,The class wasn't organized well and gave a very limited view of what TBLT is or could be.
498534,3.9,Robert,Markley,18,0.4996598587132454,Easily the most boring class I've taken in the department. His lectures were very dry because he talked for the entire period without any meaningful form of student engagement. His midterm and finals weren't particularly hard but they had say too much packed into a short time period.,"I've had Markley for 427 and 209, and he's fine. His lectures are good, and he's decently funny if political jokes, dirty jokes, and a lot of swearing are your thing. He's definitely not my favorite prof here at the U but he gets the job done - you learn and you don't have to work too hard for it. Definitely not hot though.","For 209, Markley only does the lecture portion, so check out your TAs too. In lecture though, he's great. He gets everything done on time and he does it well. He makes the readings super interesting and even relatable. He incorporates humor well, and he seems very approachable. The exams were fair, as long as you went to class and read!","I LOVE Dr. Markley. He's amazingly intelligent and he's hilarious in class. He makes his lectures interesting and memorable, too. His exams are so easy if you understand the material and study it. I would take a million more classes with Dr. Markley. Wonderful.","Had him for 209 and took this class because 1) I liked the material and 2) he was teaching it.  Wickedly clever/funny, SUPER knowledgeable about the material, comments on papers/exams are great if you really want to take your writing to the next level.  Judging from the below comments I think we need an official Bob Markley Fanclub.  Let's do it.","TAKE HIM.  I don't care for what class; if you can fit it into your 4yr plan, do it.  He's intelligent, passionate about the material, amazingly witty, and HILARIOUS.  I've been on the verge of tears in his lectures.  And, to fit in with the recurring theme, yeah, I'd say he's a pretty good-looking fellow.  Not what's important, but hey.",Really solid teacher. Fun guy with a likable personality. Stayed sick for nearly a month when I took the class but that never stopped his energy. Could talk to us like he was on our level and joked a lot. Made the topics and discussions so easy going so you could have any input without being worried he'd pick on you.,"One of the best professors I have had at UofI. Very easy, really good guy, classes are fun and the guy is funny. Material was more interesting than I thought it would be.","I went into class expecting him to be hot because of these comments, and I was very disappointed. But he is still one of the best professors I've had in four years. He really cares about what he's teaching. Doesn't take attendance. I took two classes, never read a single book, and got A- in both. Fairly easy class, great teacher.",Professor Markley is one of the most amazing professors I have had so far in my career as an English Major. He genuinely cares about students and is super passionate about the material. Definatly take this class with him!,"I really liked him. I did a James Scholar essay with him and he was really helpful and let me pick the topic. We read some pretty good short stories and discuss them in class. You really actually have to do the reading for the tests (essay, in-class) but he's a fair (not easy) grader. I recommend the class.","As hot as Mr. Darcy, though as conceited.  You have to read the books to follow along with discussion, but this is a man who loves what he teaches and has a sense of humor underneath an otherwise unapproachable exterior.","Let's just say he left his ""Mark""ley on me. Professor M...or Professor Mmmm, as I used to call him, is a class act, no pun intended. He makes the ""e"" in ""sexy"" stand for English...or rather lay for english.","Sexy protruding jaw.  Cool, retro, regency-style haircut.  Ummm, yeah, I learned so much from this genius-- everything written in the eighteenth century is DIRTY!  Oh, Bob, take me back in time...","He was really slow, I didn't like the three pop quizzes we had in class.  Hard to listen to for over an hour.  And, he chose hard books an like 35 short stories for us to read.  If you do take 103, don't even thonk about not reading the books.","by far, one of the most pretentious men on the planet. and...he...talks...so...slow at the end of each sentence to emphasize its importance. very annoying to listen to for an hour and a half.",That is frickin' hilarous...anyways..he's slightly entertaining- kinda funny- but very annoying at the same time...his TA's are **** ****s.,Uh...this teacher...uh...um...is...uh...um...uh...alright.
1836373,2.0,Lavanya,Marla,2,0.28929408501936743,She expects too much and treats us like slaves,Some of the material in class was so specific (like equations and algorithms) and she made us memorize all of it for the exam which seemed unnecessary. The avg on the midterm was around 65% which was lower than she wanted so she helped us out by giving a few more quizes to balance out the bad grades.

This was the first French class I took here and I thought it was extremely easy; I never studied and still got A's on all the tests, but I think my French level is slightly above this class. Overall though, Dan is so much fun as a teacher, probably one of my favorites here! Love!",Knows French inside and out. Explains incredibly clearly. Extremely fun. Has a lot of interesting topics to talk about. So friendly and approachable. Great with people. 207 requires attention to detail but in my opinion his tests are easy if you study.

He's great at explaining the little intricacies of french. I would love to take a class with him again.,"Dan is super fun! Material is hard, but no oral exams! No final exam either, just a paper.

So much personality and a plethora funny stories,He is really nice and awesome. I miss this class and his teaching skills. I've learned alot from him. Wish he taught 104.,Is super friendly. He has lots of personal stories about his time in France. Uses technology &amp; up-to-date media for material. Is very understandable when speaking French &amp; acknowledges that it is hard for some people so he permits easy mistakes. I loved his class!

Let's her opinion affect the material to much, but doesn't interfere with grade.",She constantly talks about being a lawyer and teaches material on a bias. She is not open to discussion on what she says in class and is actually pretty rude when you try to approach her with a disagreement in material. Professors should be able to handle criticism and respect their student's opinions--she does neither,"Discusses not holding prejudices when studying sociology, yet applies her own prejudices as the truth. Does not outline assignment expectations well.","Sociology 100 is an easy course, but I'm not a fan of Professor Marshall. She says that she is a Lawyer about every 5 minutes and teaches her opinions as if they are fact.","Wow. Terrific! Her lectures were dynamic, to say the least. Textbook completely unnecessary (save your money). The majority of what she says are irrelevant to exams, but you want to listen and learn anyway; exams are just a formality. Bottom line: she's so cool, so intelligent. Class itself was very easy.","Dr. Marshall is the best instructor I've ever had.

He also makes ice cream for the highest scoring section and student, so that is a plus :)","Honestly, Andino wasn't that great of a teacher. He constantly rushed lectures towards the end, extremely disorganized, and not great at explaining. He knows his material, so if you go to office hours, he is useful one on one. Otherwise, you learn the material by pure repetition or by actually using the book (which I didn't)","If you need to take Chem and only are in it for the GPA, take Andino. His tests I found were much easier than what i've heard from other students with different professors. Also, you can retake exams online and gain back 30% of what you missed. Not a bad lecturer either, you still need to work for your grade though.","Andino really cares about teaching, but is more of a ""it happens because it happens"" kind of guy. See him after class if you really want to understand the meaning of something. Overall, lectures are not super useful and tests are pretty straightforward.","I didn't go to any lectures because slides are online and he doesn't teach much.  I taught myself everything without the textbook; I only used the assignments and Google.   Tests are hard but padded by all the hw. The timed quizzes are representative of the questions you can expect on the midterms. In all, turned out better than I thought it would.","Lectures are pretty much useless. He goes extremely slowly at the start and rushes through all the slides during the end. Moreover, the slides are pretty much the textbook. His tests are pretty hard as just 2 mistakes can get you down to a B.","Really bad at explaining concepts, so you practically have to teach yourself everything. Tests, quizzes, and homework don't often reflect what you concentrated on in lecture so sometimes you'll have many questions on a test covering a topic you went over very briefly in lecture. TAs not great either.",Just soso,HE IS THE ALL TIME WORST. I HAVE LEARNED NOTHING. NOTHING IN HIS LECTURES IS IN THE HOMEWORK HE ASSIGNS OR THE WORKSHEETS IN DISCUSSION. DROP OUT.,"Andino is passionate about the subject and really wants you to learn. That being said, he is very available and helpful during office hours. Lectures are generally pretty interesting, but not always very easily understood. Tests are usually harder than homework, but they're still manageable. Overall, would definitely recommend!","Before taking this class, I heard so many bad things about Andino, but they are all wrong! He is by far my favorite professor I have ever had.  He is always available for office hours and wants all of his students to succeed. The exams are challenging but definitely manageable by attending his review sessions and going to office hours! TAKE HIM!",Professor Andino is a great guy. He's really nice and you can tell that he cares about his students. Go to office hours!,"lectures are very confusing and not worth going, his exams and quizzes are 100X harder than homework and what is discussed in class"
2049375,3.6,Jaime,Martinez Robles,17,0.42817896831398977,"He didnt prepare for the class at all. He hadnt announced grade breakdown until like 3 days before midterm 1. He copied the textbook on the board word by word. He also screenshot homework from anthor professors website. Even worse, homework didnt match class progress. A lot of materials showed up on syllabus but only half of them are tested.",He is a really nice professor. Always trying to make the class enjoyable.,"Not prepared well for class. The first two lectures professor robles tried to get a presentation ready on the projector but since he was not familiar with his environment he could not effectively teach. Also, he does not clean the chalk board well enough for people to see his writing. He seems like he means well but he just mumbles alot about calc","Weekly homework that only takes 1-3 hours and isn't too bad. Practice tests are just like the exams, same material. Pretty straightforward stuff.  For his teaching ability, in class it may be a bit dry but that's just just the nature of the material. If you go to office hours he's really helpful in explaining it. Great teacher, highly recommended","His lecture is clear and straightforward. His exam is fair and focuses on some basic concepts. Homework takes about several hours to complete, which is not bad compared to other courses. He is also enthusiastic about quantitative finance, and he talked a lot about application of probability theory in real life.",Chill guy who wants his students to succeed overall. Doesn't put a lot of pressure on you and takes the time to properly answer your questions.,"I am an average student and found out very quickly that I learned much better if I came to class prepared with specific questions. His lecture style requires you to pay close attention, but you will be rewarded with better grades. Often understands what you're asking even when you're unsure &amp; will work with you to reach a clear solution.","His lectures followed the book very closely. It's a good book, so that was fine. We had lots of homework, but solving many practice problems is important in 461. Midterms were quite long, but he compensated with a generous curve, and none of the questions were unexpected. The final was very fair and he made clear what was important to review.","A very nice professor. Things covered are useful in computation field, especially for CS and ECE majors.  Tests are are fair but require effort on reviewing. He makes sure that you will be fine.",He is prepared to class and the lecture lines up with the course textbook. Attending the lecture helps learning which material in the textbook is important. HW is all from the textbook and he provides past exams. The exam is similar to the past exam and HW.,"He always prepared to class, and the homework is pretty helpful. The exam is similar to the past exam.","He's a good lecturer, always ready for the class, also humorous and caring for the whole class.",The class was not that hard and the exam was pretty similar to the practice. He is enthusiastic about teaching and gave clear explanations and examples in class.,"Horrible professor. Doesn't teach anything in lecture. I only went to a few classes and did fine. Learned the stuff much better on my own. Would've got an A if I put even a little effort into studying at all, homework is really easy and then the tests are hard if you don't study, but I passed. Tests match the rest of the math department usual.","Lectures are pretty boring, and you can get the gist of the content off of the lecture slides. Probably didn't need to go to all those lectures.","Math 225 with Robles was basically pointless, instead of doing actual examples, he wasted away the 50 minutes trying to type up pre-worked examples into MATHTYPE.  The lectures were boring, and I don't even know why I ended up going to most of them.  On the bright side, I found the class pretty easy, all the exams are easy A's if you study.",I sit up front and can barely hear him. He reads off online notes and does no real time examples. When he does an example he goes so fast you will not be able to follow unless you understand the material. I currently use khan academy to learn which is pathetic since his lectures are practically useless.

Make sure you really participate because you do get graded on that. She's a very nice lady and really knows what she's talking about. Read ALL the stories too!,"She's honestly the nicest. She's always ready to help her students, and she's very approachable. Also, she's probably one of the fairest professors I've ever had. Ugh. She's great.","Pilar is one of my favourite professors at UIUC. She is extremely knowledgeable and approachable; she's always willing to accommodate and help her students. I liked her so much for 250, I took 310 with her... as did half of my 310 class. If you show up and are engaged, you shouldn't have any problem getting at least an A.",Very very clear about expectations and the tests are very easy if you attend class. Attendance points are taken but you can miss a few days no problem. As long as you pay attention in class you should get an A.

The class activities were somewhat annoying but it's only a 50 minute class so it goes by fast.,"Good teacher overall. Keep up with all your hmwrk. Hard/picky grader on discussions so take your time n check over them. She does a lot of in-class group stuff where u have convos with other ppl, some useful, some not. No oral exam (woo hoo).

Overall good class!,No Comments,"His class was easy as long as you showed up for it.  Had random quizes, but were extremely easy if you were in class.  Tests were easy and lecture notes could be found online a week before the test.  Test questions came directly from the lecture notes.

1569137,3.0,Kelly,Marville,130,0.5025460489688467,"DO NOT TAKE HER CLASS. Her exams are virtually impossible, even if you know what you're doing. She only gives an hour and fifteen minutes for 11 page exams that are all math. In other words, you will not finish. Also, she puts things we've never done or seen on the exams. There is also SO MUCH HOMEWORK. Spare your sanity and find another teacher.","She seems like a really cool professor, but like the level of difficulty of her tests is out of this world. Some of the things in her test, are not even mentioned in class. Would not recommend.","It's true that Marville's classes are challenging, but that's because chem is difficult and you need to put in the work. Her grading criteria is strict but consistent, and if you go to office hours, you will see that she really does care about the students. If you're prepared to work hard, you will succeed and learn a lot in this course.","I love her. One of my favorite and would love to get to know her better. She calmed me down from the first class with her bright enthusiasm. Yes, she can be a bit harsh and cutthroat, and her class is difficult -- I love Chem, it's basically my major, and I'm good at it; kept a solid A and barely kept it with the final. But I learned so much &lt;3","Marville is the most condescending teacher I've ever taken a class with. She builds up the students who do well and shames the students who don't. Her TAs are also much better chemistry teachers (and people) than she is. If I could go back and take CHEM 104 with a different professor, I would no doubt.","To anyone taking Chem 102, I would recommend doing the retakes and any extra credit, as both helped gradewise. Additionally, despite what everyone says about Marville, if you go to her office hours, she is pretty nice. The exams might be hard but over time you get used to the exam format. As long as you put in the work, you should be fine.",WORST PROF EVER. She is absolutely horrible and heart less. I wouldn't recommend her as a teacher or a friend. Truly the most nasty woman I have ever encountered.,"Dr. Marville is extremely tough, and generally doesn't care if you're failing. Her lectures are very dense and she has a tendency to start 2-3 minutes earlier than the posted time and finish 15 minutes early. If you have the option to, I would recommend taking another professor.","Yes, Dr. Marville is tough. But she is a great professor. She posts lecture handouts and solutions online so it is easy to follow along in lecture. Tests are difficult, but if you do the homework, quizzes, and study, an A is achieveable. Also, take the worksheets and discussion quizzes seriously. Theyre just like test questions.","Good lectures, a decent person overall, compassionate about chemistry, but she lacks empathy and compassion for the students. She gives LOTS of homework but her tests are not very reflective of the work that she makes you do building up. Its the same topics but in completely different forms. Would not recommend if youre not a Chem or Bio major.","Dr. Marville makes a nice, easy subject terrifying and unbearable. Students who want to pursue chemistry, DO NOT take this class as it will demoralise you.","Dr. Marville, in my opinion, is not a good choice for a Chem 102 class. The course and topic, in general, are easy. Chem 102 isn't a hard class by any means, but Marville makes it as hard as possible. Every weekend you will have online homework, Exam level multiple choice questions, and a quiz. Then every week you have a roughly 20-page worksheet too.","She is not an easy teacher, and you really have to understand EACH lecture in order to succeed. Her tests are very similar to the hardest questions on her worksheets  and quizzes. Lectures are also very useful to attend in order to understand the basics. If you don't understand something, I recommend going to CLC, it was a lifesaver. GOOD LUCK!!","She's definitely not easy that's for sure, but an A is possible. And she can be a tad scary at times  but she warms up when you get to know her at her office hours. Attending lectures is definitely a must, reading the book is not necessary but the problems at the end of the chapters are good practice for her exams. STUDY STUDY STUDY!!","Dr. Marville is an exceptional professor who is very professional and expects a lot out of her students. Despite what many think, she truly does want her students to succeed and will help you do so if she sees that you're determined. Exams are fair and straightforward. Just study the PowerPoint slides and worksheets and you'll be fine.","She over complicates everything and is very unclear. For example, when she was talking about z (number of protons) in class she would say zed, which confused the crap out of me for a while until I figured out what she meant. There are so many tips and tricks she neglected to teach that I learned on my own that would have made my life so much easier","She had some odd desire to make students fear her which isn't all too conducive in a class of this difficulty. At the same time, she always made it a point to come and get help from her at office hours but I've heard both horror stories and grand revelations. Personally found her lectures to be useless. Read the power points and do practice exams.",Do not recommend her. The exams are not representative of what we learn- they're way way harder. I've completed all extra credit and assignments but I currently still have a D+ in the class. Angry that I wasted my time. I spent more of my semester frustrated and worried rather than enjoying the class and learning.,"She really wants her students to succeed, but she makes it nearly impossible. There is NO curve in the class, although she claims to curve your grade at the end, which is only 1-3 percent. Her class is very exam heavy and the exams are very difficult to conquer. She takes the easiest concepts, and explains them in the most complicated manner ever.","I am annoyed that I didn't check ratemyprofessor before taking this class. Marville gives the hardest tests of any of the Chem 102 teachers, and her grading scale is extremely test heavy. Doing bad on one test sets you up for a semester full of stress. In my opinion, if you have the option to take Chem 102 with a different professor, do it."

The TAs are also great, you can't go wrong with any of them.",Easy class as long as you study for the midterm and final; we take the tests individually and then we take it again in groups! I ENCOURAGE EVERYONE TO DO THE UNIQUE VEGETABLE CONTEST! All I did was pick a veggie from a farmers market in Chicago and chose a veggie that seemed unique. But dont forget that this is a VEGETABLE gardening class! Boring!,"Extremely easy to score in the exams because you can discuss it with your friends. Lots of extra credit opportunities. He is very kind, funny and enjoyable too!","Great class, great professor! A must take at U of I!! You get to eat a lot of different food during the semester and the class is easy, but still interesting.","The best class I have ever taken at U of I! Professor Masiunas is hilarious!!

Really knowledgeable about the topic + great sense of humor(makes wheelchair jokes lol).Totally aware it's a blowoff class, and is totally cool with it. He teaches it to interest non-majors(in class you get food and mexican jumping beans!). The labs are SO FUN: tons of food tastings. Gives partner tests.The TAs are just as great.",A really great teacher whose passion for the subject definitely made the class much better then it could have been. I took this class my senior year as a blowoff course but actually ended up going to lecture all the time and even planting my own veggie garden due to everything I learned in this class. The labs are fun and his TA's are also great.,really good class. good teacher,"ditto on the previouis comments. funny sense of humor, and really hilarious when he jokes about his paralysis (i'm gonna run you over in this wheelchair if you're cheating lol)","If there's such a thing as a class that's just fun to be a part of and attend, this is the one. Almost zero stress level with this one - the labs are fun, and Masiunas' lectures are pretty interesting considering the material can get a little dry. The unique vegetable contest that students enter means trying new food on a regular basis if you want.",He was an amazing professor. He is very passionate about the subject and makes class fun.  I also had some medical issues and he was very understanding and let me make everything up.,Nicest guy you'll ever meet in your whole entire life. Brings food to class for entire lecture hall at least once a week. Labs are fun. Gives big points extra credit opportunities at the end of the semester to make up for missed assignments.

The textbook, Introduction to Electrodynamics by Dave Griffiths, is a godsend.

She's very articulate when answering any questions you might have, and very approachable. Also, her research is pretty interesting, and she is getting a lot of recognition for it. If she were to teach another course, I'd take it.","Professor Mason teaches straight from the book, but that's probably because Griffiths is an amazing textbook.  Her midterms are moderately difficult, but an insufficient amount of time is given to take them.  The final is significantly better and is worth 40% of the grade.  She genuinely cares about her students, even if most don't come to class.",Did a pretty good job explaining the slides but could not answer several questions posed by students.

The class focuses on the modernization of Paris and you read three books/write papers on them. It is extremely boring. The professor doesn't help with any questions, he directs you to the TAs which don't really help either.",I do not wear my seat belt driving to school because I want to die before I can make it to this class.,"Good god.  I have never been more bored in my life.  Bring a laptop.  Sit up top.  Anything.  I have not listened to a single lecture.  In fact, I'm typing this out during lecture.  The course description is so misleading - never have I been in a class so boring.",Don't take this class unless you have no social life and can read 50 pages a night. Professor does have a sick accent though,"Unless you are an English major or have are very interested in French and English literature from about 1500-1900, I think this class was wayyyy more work than it was worth. There was a LOT of reading. Like I said though, if it's something you are interested in, I'm sure you could gain a lot from this class, there are just better adv. comp. classes"

1178568,4.8,Fabio,Mattos,4,0.8066943789353928,One of the best professors I've ever had. Takes his class if you have the chance!,The best ever! Very helpful and inspiring!,Thanks Fabio!,Great job. Very inspiring...Excellent professor!
544295,5.0,Kevin,Matz,3,0.6089030661793119,"Kevin is great. The books were great. We even got to watch the movies! The papers arent tooo long. The deadlines are flexible. He allows rewrites for a new grade. Such a cool guy. Heck, Id be friends with him! Hes young and he understands what its like to be a college student. Probably one of the few teachers that will cut you some slack.","Kevin is so cool. We read the coolest books, we can be absent from class and we can rewrite papers as much as we want and then turn them in late!! He is so understanding and very helpful. He understands the pressure of college life. However, if you don't do your work, you will fail. DUH!","One of the best TA's I've had at U of I.  He is very flexible and very open.  He avoids BS High School style discussion and ends class when it should end.  Overall, this class could be a real hassle, but Kevin Matz made it very tollerable."
2385998,5.0,Carol,Mauck,1,0.6685138887193383,Carol is one of the sweetest professors I have had. Her lectures can get dry but she makes up for it with fun activities &amp; field trips. Would definitely recommend her classes if you are interested in working with people with disabilities or with the elderly.
632653,5.0,Martin,Maurer,2,0.6384953408360812,He is very helpful and does a lot of examples in class on Fridays. Also a nice (and hot) TA. His sensible haircut and Austrian accent kept me coming back...:-),"AWESOME TA!!!  Quizzes are very fair, attendance policy fair.  Gives really helpful handouts, has a website to ask questions if you're out of class, will meet outside of office hours. Overall and awesome guy - and hot! :)"
603704,4.5,Bill,Maxwell,4,0.6323605233513032,"He is by far my favorite teacher ever.  He makes class interesting, and is genuinely interested in the subject matter and his students.  He's not an EASY grader, but is fair and will help you do your best work.  I would love to be in another of his classes again, and reccommend him highly.","Maxwell was the coolest guy. He totally respects original thinking, and that's the best way to go in his class.",Great can-do attitude!  I know this may sound funny... but sometimes I would daydream in class (not that his lectures were boring or anything) that he was my private dancer.,"watch out for his dangerous ""blue steel"" glance. finger licking good."
1208811,2.6,Alexander,Mayer,18,0.5028358553814312,"He'll call on you when you're obviously not paying attention (who does that?) so if you have attention issues and don't like public humiliation I would not recommend. However, if you're an experienced writer this class is an easy A. The only graded work is 2 short papers that I (a senior with a writing-intensive major) had no trouble getting A's on","The class ended up having only 2 papers. One was 2 pages, and one was 4 pages. If you are respectful, and pay attention in class rather than sitting on your laptop going through Facebook the whole time, he will definitely notice. Go to class, actually listen to him (whether you understand his point or not), and write the papers with some effort.","Pretty easy class but Mayer is extremely unorganized and unclear. Little structure to class. I don't understand how a phd can't put together a PowerPoint to organize ideas. He spoke extremely quiet in the first class, I think as a tease. Average to low voice sound, difficult if you are non-native speaker. And this prof absolutely smokes green",Brilliant professor. His insight into  Zen is of a boddhisattva.,"Hands-down, the best teacher I ever had. Problem is, most students take Zen as a blow-off class. If that's your case, you can still get the grade, but you won't enjoy the class. Mayer teaches in a style unlike any other. Give the class a chance. Listen long enough and you will connect the dots.","Interesting guy. He really loved the material and he offered up some really good non traditional ideas, if you could understand him. His accent is a bit thick and he's fairly soft spoken. Overall a pretty chill class though. He doesn't grade the papers too harshly, just put a decent amount of effort in.","I had fun in this class. Mayer knows what he's talking about, and offers some interesting insights on the philosophy and how to understand it. It's not a huge workload (there are three papers, and not that many readings), so I ended up finding it fairly relaxing and quite interesting--welcome respite from the tech core courses.",Great professor and super funny as well. Sometimes a little tricky to follow and his lectures are more of a mind map of ideas then anything structured that I'm used to but it was fun to try and follow his train of thought. He's clearly a very intelligent guy.,"Mr. Mayer is a very interesting guy. THe only grades in his class are 3 papers that you have to write on some area of Buddhism, they are very easy As. He is very confusing in class though. When questions are asked he often doesn't understand what is being asked, and isn't clear in answering them. Although I do recommend this class.","It's a shame such a terrible teacher is in charge of such a wonderful class. Mayer is a great guy funny, interesting, and brilliant. But his class has no structure. His paper assignments are vague and he is a terrible educator. No question-he knows Buddhism. But you won't learn it from him. I learned everything online. and it's Friday only  : (","Mayer is a very interesting fellow. If you talk to him in person, everything will make more sense. Otherwise... he spends the entire class period talking, without a powerpoint or anything and likes to go off on tangents. It is very hard to follow, and most times he doesn't even get back to his original point.","Was so excited about the class during the first few days, but he cannot create a straight forward, clear lecture to save his life. Liked him a lot as a person, but he was unable to effectively describe the concepts in his lectures... which makes it difficult to write a 5 page paper on them....","Overall I liked his class a lot, but it should really be called a difficult intro into Buddhist Philosophy. The only work you have to do for the class is 2-3 papers. But you have to show effort to get a good grade. His lectures are  hard to follow sometimes depending on the topic, just take good notes. I thought he was a cool professor overall.","Im not sure what he talked about most of the time in lecture, but the class was easy enough... he had a good sense of humor, i just could not understand the guy or follow what he was talking about in lecture. Papers were over parts of his reader. Reading was always expected before class, but its easy enough to just read it when writing paper instea","Professor Mayer seemed like a pretty chill guy, after all the title of the class was ZEN.. however when it comes to grading papers, he pays very very close attention to detail and word choice in grading papers.  Can also be very boring and confusing.  stay on his fun side","Although his expectations for his students are not that clear, and the questions he sets on the papers are somewhat vague, as long as you try and put some effort into your work, he'll give you a good grade. If you mess about, though, and don't go to class, it is very obvious you'll fall onto his bad side.",The most boring professor one earth.  Not clear at all and is very unclear of his expectations for students.  Gives only a couple of papers per semester which determine your entire grade.,"Absolutely hysterical!! He makes almost no sense during his lectures but he is really funny. Whether it's his really thick accent or the totally random things he says, I was always laughing. But I didn't understand any of the material. It's okay though because there's only 2 papers the entire semester!!"

She's really interesting.,She is a great professor for these introdution courses. She also has a great personality and she'll keep the classes interesting. The exams are easy and I reccommend actually reading the material- it'll make the class more enjoyable. The TAs were also really knowledgable and knew how to handle obnoxious people really well.,Professor Mayo is phenomenal,BE SURE YOU GET ELLEN FOR A TA...SHES AWSOME,Her TA Jennifer Logue is HORRIBLE.,this professor was amazing. she whould give out study guides before our exams that would have a list of word and if we knew them and their connection to authors and readings we would be fine on the test. she would even go over these lists in class. TA (Ellen McWhort) was also very  helpful.,This class was awesome. she's an amazing professor and i always looked forward to her lectures. I would recommend her class to anyone.,"Gosh, she was awesome! She was funny, the class was great, and she really was caring about what she taught.  MUST TAKE!","Hilarious in class! Sometimes she talks really fast and drifts from the subject but generally catches herself when it gets too far. She enjoys class participation. Lot's of reading, but nothing to get stressed about.",She's hilarious and really nice.  Very straightforward on all tests and papers.  Very interesting class with not too much work.,"She is so funny, and she lets you know what she is looking for in assignments, and on tests.  I love the class.  The worst of it is reading.  But its not that bad.",Funny in lecture.  Papers weren't too bad.  Haven't yet taken a test in order to rate.  Grading scale pretty decent.  I would recommend it!  Keep up on the readings...not too difficult of reads either.,easy,She is the craziest teacher you'll ever have!!  Very fun class!!!

1134475,3.8,Mike,Mazzocco,2,0.5470217479600326,Mazzocco is awesome. He makes class fun by cracking jokes and telling relevant stories.  Never gets too far off track.  Very knowledgeable man and a pleasure to talk to.  He really cares about his students and how well they are learning. I would highly recommend a class with him!,"Class itself is not the easiest, but he does curve, so that's a good thing. It's tough to expect what his tests are, take notes, you probably want to read the chapters too. You go interview a manager, he graded that tough too, but as I said, he curves the class so if you do badly on the tests, don't worry so much about that."
2303553,5.0,Justin,McAdara,1,0.666608172324908,"Mr. Mac is definitely one of my favorites lecturers ever, and I would take any of his classes again. He is very experienced and knowledgeable, so his feedback and advice are all valuable. He is also one of the sweetest instructors I know, always walking in with a smile. His lectures taught me a lot on public speaking, so my grade kept on improving."

His stupid jokes actually make you want to come to class!  If you want to do well on the short-answer exams, you have to memorize his definitions verbatim.  The class isn't that bad.  It's actually pretty fun.",Fun guy. Interacts with his students and actually remembers names from people in lecture. Didn't like that he teaches right off powerpoint.,"awesome prof.  great sense of humor and often calls people out in class.  you have to go to every class, he doesn't post his notes online, but classes are very interesting and his teaching style is really easy to learn from.  don't bother buying the text book, you're supposed to read it but nothing is on the exams that he doesn't cover in class","Great professor. Very british sense of humor and speaks with a touch of an british accent. Class is pretty challenging with all short answer essay exams, no multiple choice exams.

But he's nice &amp; will re-explain things you don't get. But: no study guides","He is honestly a very good teacher. Very nice and helpful. Make sure to attend EVERY class and listen while you take notes. If you go over the notes and READ the chapters that go with the notes, you can get an A on the exams. Projects are easy. There are not many As on the exams  . They definitely require you to study."

She is really easy to approach if you are struggling and her lectures are fantastic. Her exams are decently challenging, but they are very fair. I would highly recommend her!! (Also her dog is super cute)","I was very confident with the lecture materials, very confident. However, come the exam time, I was very stumped at every one of them. Her exams are, personally, nothing like what you will for problems sets, maybe with the exception of a few questions towards halfway in the exam. Never have been so confident in lectures only to fail exams.",Show up to lecture and lab and you won't really have to study for the exams. Refer back to past tests as they will be very similar to the ones you will take. She's very kind and tries to make lectures less boring by throwing in jokes.,Elise was a great Professor. Her Lectures are informational. She does a lot of demonstrations need to go for the I-Clicker points. You have to do the readings. All in all no real complaints about the class.,Decent professor. She was a high school teacher last year and Im not sure she knows how to teach a college level course yet. Knows a lot about the subject though. Lots of cool demonstrations in lecture,"She was a great professor, she used to be a high school teacher and it shows in the way she is really able to break down tough material into simple concepts. Would definitely take her again if I had the chance. Also, she has a tendency to blow things up in lecture.",This class is not bad if you read your textbook and if you do the Lon Capa homework. Prof. McCarren is super nice and she does a lot of in-class tests.
1016335,3.5,Matthew,McCarter,1,0.57442760986954,SUPER EASY. So many extra credits for you to earn. I got 75% for both midterms and final and I still got an A
146997,3.4,T.,McCarthy,15,0.5428131603847748,"Took this course last semester, dropped it and picked PHIL 102 taught by Prof. David Gilbert. Same content and materials but McCarthy just picked a weird textbook. Also he's not very good in explaining the contents so I would recommend other alternatives if you really want to take an intro logic course.","I only took this for the gen ed credit thinking this sounded like simple in comparison to the usual existential phil courses. However, this class makes no sense! It's called logic and reasoning, but it's really just arguments. If you zone out for one minute, McCarthy has already gone through the incomprehensible slides. Know definitions for quizzes","He really knows what he's talking about and can easily clear up any confusion about the material. Attendance isn't graded, but I recommend going. I never did the practice problems or read but got As on all the exams just by taking notes in lecture. Professor McCarthy is not the most dynamic lecturer, but he's a sweet guy and lowkey kinda funny.",BEST TEACHER EVER. And best class. super easy and fun. HAVE to take at least one class with him during undergrad.,"I'd never had a logic class before and I am  hopeless at math, but he made it really easy to understand.  Sure, most people won't use this stuff in the real world, but for those of us who need it for Grad work or LSAT prep, it's a good choice.  He's very smart and very helpful. Go to class and take notes and you'll do fine.",This is one of the best classes I've taken at U of I. Prof. McCarthy is a brilliant man and this class just blows your mind. Couldn't ask for a better professor.,Easiest class ever taken on campus! he was one of the nicest profs. really enjoyed being in his class. you basically just need to attend lectures to be able to do the quizes without having to study much.,"Some may disagree, but I found him to be a very strong professor. You pretty much need to attend every lecture and jump on help (discussion, office hours) immediately if you find yourself falling behind; being a week or two behind the curve will not cut it. Otherwise, not a particularly hard class.","whether or not u will like this class depends on u, I loved it.. He teaches the principles of logic in a mathematical approach... if u like to learn through abstract principles then u will like this... but if are rather use really life situations and want it to be applicable the take the LD",This class was not what I expected.  It was just a lot of unecessary stress and frustration.  Overall the grade is curved a ton because pretty much everyone does bad.,"Really disliked the class.  Nothing we have learned will ever be applied.  Basically, its a waste of time.","I only had him for intro to logic, but it's clear that he is a professional logician.  Was able to elucidate first-order logic accurately and comprehensively, and constructed exams in a way that followed suit with his lectures.",Pretty good with his lectures.  Good examples.  Make sure you learn from the very beginning because it all builds on each other.  Some quizzes and tests came out of nowhere while others were easy.,"A man with passion towards his subject. However a number classes ended with the students dumbfounded and confused. Students recieved their mid-terms graded, the day of the final, and there were two grades in the class.",very good.  You will know what a deductive argument is for the rest of your life
537576,3.9,Randy,McCarthy,48,0.524802418224178,Followed Randy for my freshmen year and learned a lot. Homework is good material for study as well as the worksheets he assigned in discussions. He does before class exercising with question regarding material learned before but I can't get up that early... Lecture is really useful and try to put effort in the study.,"Calc 2 is notoriously hard,but Randy made it very manageable. The TAs I had were phenomenal and without them I wouldn't have passed. While at times it seemed like I was in way over my head, he assigns lots of problems (both homework and practice) and is very forgiving in his grading policies.","Good professor, lectures are super helpful! He tells you exactly what each problem on the test will be on however, the tests are tough. Fair grading policy ( doesn't curve but will replace one midterm with the final.) You can tell he wants you to learn not just get a grade. Hard class but I actually learned calculus.",I liked him,"Does not give partial credit which sucks. while you know the types of questions that will be on the test, he makes them extremely difficult. I never missed a class, and it was still super challenging","If you really want to LEARN Calculus, take Randy's class. He's an excellent instructor, and designs his class such that if you work hard, you'll get a good grade. So if you are up for the challenge and are willing to work hard, you'll do well and have a great understanding of Calculus.","He knows his stuff, but he's kinda intimidating. He doesn't always go over what you're expected to know. He's really funny though and clearly intelligent.  I really tried and still didn't do well though.","Seriously, do not take his class. Tests are tough,and he is a harsh grader.","Brilliant lecturer. Gave me new perspective on a lot of things, often explained how things being taught were used in daily life. Tells exactly what is going to be on the exam, does not test unnecessary stuff. Book use minimal to none. Actually solving webassign helps a lot. Exams are challenging, but interesting and manageable. I loved his class!","Even through I didn't get an awesome grade, Professor McCarthy is a great math professor. Lectures are amazing, go to them! He's very clear and doesn't over complicate things. Tests are pretty hard, but he tells you what's on them! He has a grade replacement policy and overall is a fair grader. Definitely recommend.",Lectures are helpful because he goes over some questions that will likely be tested on. Lots of what he says will be unclear unless you pre read the section  he is going over. With this class its all on you to understand the material. Use the tutoring its free. Use the past exams and the outlines of the test he gives before the exam.,"The lectures are barely useful and he spends 20 minutes on theorems in order to help you understand that just end up confusing you and wasting class time. He attempts to give extra help with tutoring and practice tests but with 1 TA for 20 students and no answer key, who does this really help? Also picks trick questions for exams on purpose.","Professor McCarthy loves to add online assignments with just a couples days notice (a huge inconvenience when trying to deal with an engineering workload), his tests and assignments are rather loosely based around what he actually teaches during lectures, and he's a very harsh grader. He also offers almost no material to prepare for exams.",Brilliant Class,"He's a pretty great teacher. I took the engineering section of calc 2 first semster and dropped it quickly. But when i took his class in the spring, i did awesome in it and he loves it if you ask him questions after class and in office hours. He was so much easier to understand, I wish he taught all my math classes.","He's nice in the grading since he provides students bonus and replacement for the lowest exam score. His teaching is not bad but I have to learn things by myself after class. His exam is not very easy though. But still, thanks to the bonus and replacement he gives, I did very well in math  231.","Great teacher, loves what he does. You have to work hard to learn the material, but he tells you EXACTLY what you need to know for exams, so if you put the time in you'll get a good grade. He's very helpful and set up a tutoring service run by TA's, so if you want to succeed the resources are there for you to succeed. Great guy and great teacher",probably the best calculus professor here. strongly recommend taking his classes. calc is obviously not an easy class and it requires a lot of work but he sets all the students up for success. tells you what is going to be on every test and replaces one test grade with final.,"Really great professor!Strongly advice to take Calc with him. Work hard to make students understand and always patient to explain.Tell you exactly what will be on the exam. Go to the lectures, pay attention and you will be fine. Very high value past exams. Hard homework on webassign, not closely related, but provide answers right away. Easy quiz.",Amazing teacher- funny and intelligent.

Lectures were always interesting and you learn a lot about our media, advertising, politics, etc. He's also just a really great guy. I would take any class he teaches.","This was by far, one of the most interesting classes I have ever taken! He really knows the topics and this class will really make you rethink American media and politics. There are 3 books (they were VERY interesting) , 2 papers on the books, and 3 exams that were difficult (but very manageable as long as you attend lecture and read the books.","Amazing class. Its extremely simple, read the books and take quizzes on them. NOTHING else. A hell of a lot of reading but the books are pretty interesting and once again, there is NOTHING ELSE! No tests, long papers, projects, nothing. Just weekly quizzes on the readings and write a 1-page review of the book every two weeks.","I would never recommend this class to anyone. This was one of the worst courses I have ever taken. The only thing that helped me pass was the huge curve he gives and the papers. The tests are long and horrible. I understood everything that was covered in class, however still did horribly on the exams.","Confusing, subjective but very interesting topic... as long as you are more liberal. Lots of reading. Not much writing. Wordy and difficult exam, but huge curving anyway.","A very difficult, but interesting course. I personally chose to attend nearly every lecture and not only did I learn a lot, it made the class a hell of a lot easier.

Ridiculous waste of time in a course and would not recommend it. so much for the environment considering you make your exams 100+questions printed one side,"One of the most brilliant minds UIUC has to offer. Seriously, come into this class with an open and critical mind, and it'll be the best class you take. ATTEND LECTURE, DO THE READINGS. Exams are about 110 MC questions, would be impossible if you don't attend all lecs/read. I got As on every one of his exams without it, but his curve is immense.",Professor is well educated on the material. It's also a pretty interesting course;I found a lot of the reading and lecture material interesting. If you go to all of the lectures and pay attention you'll be fine.,great professor. well educated. interesting class. very enjoyable.,"Very good professor. Really knows his stuff. The course is very interesting and you learn a lot. The exams are long, but if you go to lecture and pay attention and take notes you'll do fine. He curves all the tests big time. Highly recommend.","Maybe it's because I had an interest and prior knowledge of some of the material going in, but I didn't think his class was that difficult. If you go to lecture and pay attention, you'll do great. I aced all of the tests that he talked up as being very difficult.","Extremely hard professor. However, if you can motivate yourself to read half a book a week (200-250 pages) you'll get an A in the class. There's only one (long paper). The class is essentially listening to an epic cmn scholar ramble about politics. I found this class really interesting. Don't take if you want a blowoff. Take it if you want to learn",smart guy. know his stuff. hes pretty left in his views but he does a good job of explaining both sides. if you're a leftist youll enjoy his class and pass it easily if you understand the core concepts. reading the books helps but isnt necessary. neede for the papers as supporting material. if ur not leftist you can still pass but ull hate the clas,"If you understand politics understand that this professor's career is propagated by selling books and giving speeches about his very socialist view of power, media, and politics. You will purchase books written by him and others by his friends (some books/parts dedicated to each other's research). He teaches just as much opinion as fact.",BRING COMPUTER TO CLASS OR PRINT NOTES BEFORE. VERY PASSIONATE ABOUT THE MEDIA. CAN BE VERY BORING AT TIMES. A LOT OF MATERIAL TO STUDY. TESTS ARE EXTREMELY HARD AND LONG !! ...BUT HE CURVES THEM A FAIR AMOUNT. GOOD LUCK. TWO PAPERS ON THE BOOKS AND 3 TESTS.,"A really interesting class that critiques the media.  Take this class if you are in the College of Media, a lot of the material comes up in future classes.  A lot of reading, but the books are easy reads!  Tests are BRUTAL but he curves a good amount.",Easy class. Lecture was boring and you don't have to go but it helps. Reading the books helps with the papers. Bring a laptop to class.,"The class covers issues in American sports ownership, media influence, militarism, technology, economy, and ecology. The class is meant to weed out those who aren't passionate about the topics, so be prepared to work hard and learn much.","Great teacher.  Incredibly intelligent in his field.

Takes an interesting class and turns it in to a bore.  Just rants about nothing and her lecture slides are pointless.,"Dreadful.  It's Human Sexuality, so it really should be interesting, but she manages to make it borderline incomprehensible sometimes.  She acts like the students are pests interrupting her 50 minute monologue when they ask her to slow down.  She also can't use a computer at all.

Didn't help with essays or rough drafts at all.","Not only is she a very strict grader, especially for a class which is supposed to be an easy A; she also doesn't seem to care about her students.

She's also very strict about attendance, miss four classes and you can't get an A, miss six classes and you fail the course.",Take her class and get an A.,Has no idea how to handle classroom discussion or how to actually teach material. Makes tons of comments that indicate she does things to make life easier and more convenient for herself at the expense of her students.

You MUST study for the exams but she gives you a definition list so it's super easy to study and you dont have to study beyond that. I definitely recommend this course as a GPA booster and because it is really good material that she discusses.,"Incredible teacher, brilliant researcher. Attendance wasn't required but participation was necessary to really learn the material. Really supportive and encouraging. Asks tough questions that are worth discussing and working to find the answer. I was dreading SOC 480 but it ended up being my favorite because of Prof. McDermott.","Great teacher. Tells exactly what will be on exam. Memorize definitions, they are important. Really don't need the book because she emphasizes key point. Class participation is VERY important and she makes info applicable.","McDermott is amazing! Since this is a theory class, I went in thinking it would be very difficult. WRONG. She made everything we read understandable. Her attendance list is generated randomly. If she calls on you and you're not there, you'll lose 20%. Shes amazing.  She really makes an effort to connect with her students. Take her class.","Amazing Professor, high-quality course","She's funny and very intelligent.  She has 3 exams and a debate and a 2 page reaction paper.  The only weird thing is attendance.  She generates a random list and you have to be there if she calls your name or you lose points.  She's an awesome teacher, I highly recommend taking her class.  I wish she had another class I could take.","she is the best professor i have ever taken at uiuc. definately take her class if you have the chance. As long as you show up, pay attention and participate you will get an A. I barely studied for any of the test and ended up with a 98%","Infinite thanks to the Department of Sociology for hiring such an inspiring and competent  professor to lecture on Sociological Theory.  Professor McDermott's ways with words clarified any confusion I had reading the dense texts of Marx, Weber, etc.   Moreover her lectures made me really think about society's structure in ways I never imagined.","I dreaded this class. Sociological Theory sounds terrible, but it was the complete opposite. If anyone else taught this class, it would have bored me to death, but McDermott explained everything so clearly. She made her lectures interesting, engaging, and easy to pay attention to. I would take any class taught by her, no matter what the subject.",I literally thought this was going to be the hardest class of my semester because she comes off the first day pretty strict and it feels as though you will have to work really hard.  This was really not the case.  She is awesome and if you just listen to her in class- you will do fine on the tests.  I would def take any of her classes again!,Most inspiring and chill professor ever,"Fantastic professor.  Her lectures can be interesting and interactive for you with minimal effort. The way she engages students made me very at ease and willing to participate, even though it wasn't required.

All the information he teaches is on the slides or in the books. He's got a thick curve though.","He mostly just read off of the slides, making his lectures rather pointless. Tests are easy. He gave lots of extra credits and curved all of the tests.","His class is pretty interesting. Going to class is crucial as he mentions things that will be on the exams that are not on the powerpoints he posts online. Exams are a piece of cake, and are very basic problems that he teaches. He focuses a lot on the mathematical models which is cool if you like math",McDermot's Macro Class was a breeze. Post lecture online and also post pre-lecture videos online which is the exact same as lecture. First two exams were easy and the Final is new material since the second exam and then problems straight from the first two exams.,"McDermott's Macro class is pretty much a breeze, there are only 2 tests and a final each worth 25%, and each one is easy. He basically posts videos of each lecture online for the Pre-Lecture quizzes, so you don't even need to go to lecture. Only thing wrong is that he goes through the ppts like the flash and yells at people for chatting.",The lectures were very fast paced and he read straight through the powerpoint. This class had a ton of homework and it did not relate to the material that was on the tests. There was not a good way to prepare to take the tests (which made up the majority of the grade). The extra credit was given when students did not use technology in class.,Very specific about what he expected of students. Take neat notes and come to class ready to learn. A lot gets discussed during lecture. Read before class.,"McDermott takes a very mathematical approach to 303. The bulk of the class is solving models, but his section gives great insight into thinking like an economist. Homework can be a bit tough, but it really prepares you for exams. One great thing about Eric is how available he makes himself to help students with material. Generally a solid choice.","I really liked the structure of econ 103 when I took it. Eric puts more supplementary slides online in addition to the ones given in the lecture book. The final was basically both of the midterms plus some more recent material. Generally, just do the reading and sort of pay attention in lecture.","If you want the grade, be sure to work for it. Attend all lectures, review all notes and previous tests/quizzes, and read the text book. Defintely, ask TA if you need help.","This was the first economics class I took at U of I and it was not nearly as bad as I thought it would be. He's great at explaining and keeps his lectures interesting. As long as you keep up with readings, homework and go to lecture you'll have no problem getting an A.","He seems like a really cool dude, but the lectures are pretty boring. If you want to do well on the short answer on the tests, you have to pay attention to the little random examples he talks about in lecture. Curves are huge. I'd never taken an econ class before, and each of my tests were curved to over a hundred. Super easy, super chill.","Great teacher, but you should go to lecture and pay decent attention if you want an A.","He should be known as Eric ""THE GOAT"" McDermott. Great guy and great professor",McDermott is a good professor and teaches the topic clearly. He's a big troll and classes have funny moments (i.e. i-clicker questions are funny at times). I love the curve since it helps me pass. Good grades and a good intro class.,"McDermott is a great professor and teaches the topic clearly and concisely. But more importantly this man is the biggest troll of my life, and I say that in the best way possible. This man went up to the Foellinger balcony once just to wake everyone up there that was sleeping and it was a hilarious time. Great class great guy.","McDermott is a troll at times, but he is an awesome professor. As long as you go to lectures, you will be able to get A's on the midterms, and sometimes even over a 100% because of the giant curves. Also, I recommend buying the workbook because the midterms are mainly based off that. Overall, he's an awesome dude and the class is worth it.","Really easy class and great professor. Lectures are detailed and test curves are huge. Just do the work, read the textbook, and attend lectures to get an easy A.","Great lectures and a funny guy. Lectures are mandatory due to iClicker points. But MOST IMPORTANTLY, he goes over certain minute details/examples in his lecture which are not in the book and those are frequently tested in the exams.","super easy class, just do the work and you'll be guaranteed an A.

Easy A if you do the readings and write well.,"Dr. McKee is such an intelligent woman, but we barely followed the syllabus, directions and prompts for papers were unclear, we only read one book (but were told to buy 3 others)--it was just a hot mess. Dr. McKee is such a sweet lady, but that's about where it ended for this class. It left more to be desired.",She is wonderful multicultural background  and   has  very deep  knowledge.,"PLEASE do not take this class with this professor. This class has no organization what so ever. Malaika is a horrible professor and doesn't seem to know how to handle having ""power."" But she does not tell you what information you need to actually retain but she lectures an entire book during lecture. This class is extremely frustrating!",TEACHER IS ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE.

I did well in the class, except for the midterm exam... I studied over 12 hours and got a D- on it. Do the extra credit essay. I regret I didn't","Speaks so quickly and puts barely anything on her slides, so you need to go to lecture (w/laptop) to get the material she'll ask on exams. Asks students to read way too much for a gen ed and then asks specific questions on the readings on exams. Adds unnecessary difficulty in areas just so the class doesn't seem too easy. A lot of easy EC, though.","Agree with the guy who starts out with ""This professor is extremely passionate"" 100%. I do not enjoy her as a person at all. She is very mean and unfair. However, the whole class is out of almost 1300 points and the grading scale is out of 1000, so anything above like a 930 is an A, which is pretty dope. I don't recommend this class but geneds suck","This professor is extremely passionate about the subject matter, but she unfortunately tries to teach you EVERYTHING about latin america. She speaks faster during lecture than I have ever heard a person talk before and she doesn't give you direct access to the slides.

You do have to put in work for your grade, but if you do, it should be no problem!","Extremely nice, very helpful if you email him with any questions, coursework is extremely boring and is all about current oppression, not really anything historical. ridiculous amount of coursework.

The class is challenging but there is a lot to be learned from this great professor.,"5p book review, 10p research paper, 9p (roundabout) handwritten midterm.

Overall pretty easy and interesting class.","Can be dull at times, but overall a great teacher","This class was like one giant discussion. I enjoyed it so much. Provides different perspectives on religion, ethics, and the environment. I'm pretty quiet so I just kinda sat there and listened, but I got so much out of the class. Prof McKim is extremely laid back, intelligent, and not the least bit condescending. Just try to think outside the box.","Very good philosophy professor, but you have to like engaging in discussions about the class topic in order to enjoy his class, because you will be bored if you do not. He will make you elaborate on your conclusions but will not punish you for disagreeing with him.","The class requires a fair bit of reading and contemplation. For the majority of the course there is a weekly two page writing assignment (one page single spaced) but he will discontinue these as papers and exams draw near. If you ask him, he will clarify any questions. If you show up and engage regularly, he will do his best to help you that he can",Good teacher. Laid back. Every class is just a discussion about the reading. Decent amount of writing but overall really liked him and the class.,"This teacher is Scottish and does things a lot differently than most professors.  He does like the sound of his own voice, but who wouldn't? He sounds like Sean Bean.  Great teacher, who is published in his subject material and very well spoken.","Professor McKim is an incredibly caring teacher.  This class is not easy - there are a lot of difficult concepts, but if you make a visible effort to understand, he will get you the rest of the way there.  With your initiative, he is very helpful and willing to clarify.","He is quite possibly the most boring human being that has ever existed.  Even though this is an Intro course, he still expects you to be able to make PhD level analysis of concepts he does a terrible job of going over.

Her grading components are well distributed and provoke your thoughts and help you actually learn and critique what you are reading. Her grading is pretty fair too.,She is very enthusiastic about the class she teaches but it appears fake. She asks many elementary questions during the lecture that make you feel dumb sitting there because the questions are not worth asking. The lectures are easy but the tests are challenging. Show up to lecture; she takes pop attendance and also the powerpoints are incomplete,McLafferty is very kind and helpful. She truly loves her subject and tries to make it interesting.

Geography majors at U of I are luck that she teaches Spatial Analysis.,As of Spring 2009 I am taking Geog 371 Spatial Analysis. Last semester I took her Geography 104 course. She is a very knowledgeable professor and I learned a lot in her class. Overall her courses are very enjoyable and she is very fair.,"The class was enjoyable and the teacher was helpful.

The exams were always easier to prepare with study guides before hand.,"She sets extremely high expectations, but then constantly drops the ball on her end. She never responds to emails. She can be very rude in class. She grades very harshly. I would never take this professor again.","She is a completely close-minded person, and incapable of teaching. Her lectures are dreadful, and they drag on forever.  She also has a very unprofessional attitude if you approach her after class or through email.  She definitely created a negative academic experience at UIUC.",Profesor McLaughlin was absolutely awesome.  I went into the course after seeing her rate my professor ratings but they are NOT representative of her teaching abilities and the course.  She is extremely knowledgeable and lenient in grading.  I really don't know how anyone can take this course and do poorly if they use all the resources she gives.,"Horrible professor. She may seem nice, but she's really shady. Her teaching style is not very good. Her lectures are irrelevant to any material that's covered in quizzes and essays. She grades your essays in a pass/fail basis. I don't recommend her at all.","Prof McLaughlin is extremely fair in her grading/syllabus. Her lectures may get boring but thats because its a lot of reciting.

The book we used was quite boring but lectures were good enough to pay attention to.  Mandatory attendance made it a pain esp. on Fridays. Tests weren't that bad if you paid half attention and at least read the readings once.  Grading was actually pretty fair to I thought. 10 easy 250 word essays.,"I did not enjoy Prof. McLaughlin at all. The first grade a received was a D because she was supposedly ""testing"" us to try harder. Her lectures were horrendous and she is cold and mean spirited. If you're a Christian - DON'T EVEN BOTHER! She'll make you feel like a worthless tool by the second week of class.","Horrible professor.  Extremely hard and unfair grader.  There is a lot of readings outside of class and you are required to read all of them.  Her lectures are interesting and she seems nice, but I have never in my life met such a hard grader.  Do not take this class.  And if you are taking it, drop it immediately.","I absolutely HATED this professor. Her class isn't very interesting and she is so closed minded its ridiculous. I felt like she was a hard grader simply because she wanted to be. You have to do ALL the readings, and thoroughly might I add, if you even want to come close to getting a good grade. And in the end, I feel like I didn't learn anything.","WARNING to students looking for good professor and decent grade: DONT TAKE M. MCLAUGHLIN.

Made sure you were reading the material by picking up 1-page papers once a week, but these were very forgivingly graded. Fun class, effective teacher.","I quite liked her. Her tests are based on the study guide, so make sure you know the terms on there. She gives you the final essay questions a week before the final.",Horrible teacher - tries to push her views on you - very anti-religious - and makes you feel like your worthless if you do value god - i hated her class,"She's a good lecturer, but the majority of the tests were on book readings, and less on lecture.  If you just want to pass, skip the lecture.  If you really want to learn interesting stuff, go.","Superb lecturer; those who think her lectures are a waste of time don't know why they're in class, and should probably not be in college.","needs to be told that making lectures interesting and engaging is, in fact, an acceptable and commonly used practice",No need to go to lecture.  :)

In personal interactions with him I realized it was an act and he couldn't care less about me as an individual student","Definitely one of my favorite professors at UIUC so far. Great guy, explains things clearly and really cares about students learning the material. Exams have some tough questions, but he does that to teach you to think critically rather than just memorize things. Wish he taught more courses here!",I love Brad so much. Literally cannot describe it to you. Such a great guy and rewards his students for putting in the effort. Also a Biology advisor so you can get to know his personally should you choose to do so. Has high expectations but the class is structured so well that all of his requirements are absolutely justified.,"This professor knows what hes talking about. He teaches students in a way that can be understood no matter their biology background. Not only are his lectures easy to follow along with, but also hes available for office hours. My advice is to fit office hours into your schedule weekly. Do NOT be afraid to ask questions.","Brad is an excellent professor. He's not only an expert on the material but also knows how to communicate it effectively. He's a very caring guy and will always make time to help people out (even if it's not about biology). Still, MCB 150 is a very difficult class: go to office hours, pay attention, and study every day if you want to do well.",Great Guy. Definitely go to his office hours,"I thought the lectures were very interesting and that the in class questions were very relevant. The exams were very specific and therefore difficult, but overall if you pay attention in lecture and discussion, it's an easy A with a generous curve of the class.","The first half of the class I couldn't stand Brad, and then after exam 2, he became my fave professor ever. Hands down one of the most caring professors I've had. This class is HARD but he gives you all the resources you need to succeed, you just have to give yourself enough time to study it. Attend class, record the lectures, &amp; make concept maps!","Brad is one of the best professors I've had at the university! His lectures are very engaging, and he cares deeply about all of his students. Make sure to use all the resources he gives you in order to do well! Textbook reading and practice exams are a must.","Professor Mehrtens is one of the best Professors I have ever had. Although I took this course online in the summer, he still made it seem as if we were in class and was very clear in all aspects. I learned SO much from this class. Although it is difficult, he truly makes you think hard on questions and makes you connect topics together.","Brad is a good professor, but his tests are hard even when youve studied for 12+ hours. I definitely recommend taking all the practice tests you can to get used to the question types. I failed the first two exams and still ended with a B- in the class because he has an adjusted grading scale. Be ready to study!","Great professor! He holds office hours which is very helpful, if you pay attention in class and attend office hours every other week, you will enjoy this class rather than stressing about it.",Brad is an amazing professor. The class is difficult but he makes lectures interesting.,He is definitely the best mentor I have ever met.,This course was by no means easy  you will have to work for you grade. The tests are definitely something to get used to. Lots of applications so make sure you understand the material thoroughly. I highly suggest you attend TA office hours (Shafi is AMAZEBALLS) and Brads office hours.,"Really tough, but best teacher of all time.","Brad is the best professor at UIUC. He actually cares about how you, and knows everything about the class that he's teaching. The tests are very hard but if you study a lot they are manageable. Do not skip lecture or else you wont do well",Tests are tough and worth most of your grade but it'll teach you how to properly analyze questions before answering.,He is my HEro,"Professor Mehrtens is a great lecturer and an even more interesting guy. You can tell that he knows a lot about the subject, and he cares a lot about biology and how his students perform. That being said, this class is not easy by any means, but it is possible to do well if you try.  Voice record the lectures because he speaks fast, and take notes"

Do not worry about this class!,"She's not a great lecturer; she sometimes doesn't express herself well and there are a lot of pauses while she's talking. Otherwise, the class is quite fun and super easy. ResponsesExams aren't hard and there's a good amount of extra credit to make up for lost points. Going to class is a good idea even though lectures are boring.","Super easy class, especially if you're familiar with Bollywood. On the downside - be prepared to read some real ridiculous feminist drivel, because in the humanities, opinions = facts. Who needs evidence and proof when you have *feminist theory*.","While the class was interesting, she expects you to be familiar with Indian directors, film stars, and Indian history. The tests reflect 0% of the class content but weekly responses are easy. She's a nice person but the class was boring if yo u aren't familiar with the topics she discusses which often don't relate to the films at all. 4/10 tops","She was really nice and new the material really well. The in class discussions could get heated at times so that made it a lot more interesting. There was hardly any homework and the weekly in class assignments were a breeze. Despite that, I did feel like I learned a lot. Good course, good instructor.","The most boring class I've ever participated in. Although lectures and discussions are mandatory, I have been to less than half of the classes because I'd rather risk losing points than sitting through that class. Discussion TA is horrible, has no idea what he's talking about. Avoid, there are much better classes that fulfill gen eds.",This is undeniably the stupidest class I've taken so far. The worst part is the 8-10 page term paper on that stuff that we didn't learn/she didn't teach us.,"I hate this class. She is absolutely useless when it comes to lecturing, and extremely boring on top of that. She lectures about random things that have nothing to do with the stories we read, and then quizzes us on things that are neither in the stories, nor in her lectures. She's also a horrible procrastinator.","Buy the lecture notes and the book and don't bother going to class. Rini spends the whole time reading straight from her notes. The only thing that you might need to go to class for are for the pictures that are going to be on the tests. Honestly, you'll be fine as long as you read the book. The tests are very straight forward.",Memorize your workbook and do the readings. Just attend class to take pictures of the slides or get a friend to do it. Very attainable A and no +-.,"Easy A.  Don't have to go to her lectures, just read the study guide and textbook.  If you decide to go to her lectures, then you don't have to read the textbook, just copy down the lecture notes because you won't be able to understand her.

Really smart and obviously knows her stuff, but goodness she is so boring. You don't really need to go to class. Interesting material and an easy A, but not great for lectures.",DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!!!!!! SO So boring....you will fall asleep. Not necessarily hard....but so boring.,"The most boring class I've had this semester. Stay AWAY!!!!!!! Not necessarily hard, but you will fall asleep in every class.","Easy class.  REALLY boring lectures, but I never go and I do fine on the tests.  Also impossible to hear in lecture.  Tests are easy as long as you read.  Luckily, the reading is pretty interesting.  Not a bad choice.","The readings are really interesting but the lectures are super boring. Attendance at lectures isn't mandatory at all and usually on 25% of the kids show up. She's really boring and hard to hear in the back. I would however recommend going to discussion, that's where you actually learn. It's an easy A class.","I thought the material was interesting and even though she is not an outrageous lecturer, if you pay attention you can really learn a lot and she can actually be quite entertaining. I took two classes by her, both were easy A's because I enjoyed the material we covered.","A very easy non-western course where skipping lecture is not a problem. If you attend discussion section weekly and review the material in the study guide you're provided, this is an easy A. The paper was a breeze. As long as your wrote memorization skills are pretty strong, you'll have no trouble with this course.","Average lecturer, but she knows her stuff. I did my honors paper with her and she was extremely helpful. The class was interesting but relatively easy. She's always willing to help a student, though, and tries to make the lectures as interesting and clear as possible.",No Comments
1429298,2.5,Prashant,Mehta,3,0.2929777449133502,Assigns a terrible textbook. Does not post lecture notes. Does not post practice exams. Exams are convoluted versions of HW questions. His lectures are straight out of the (terrible) textbook.  The HW solutions posted are atrocious with the same solution having different nomenclature used in different problems with superficial solutions-no details,I felt like he doesnt know the content he is teaching in this class. He made the exams very very long. And graded whimsically. I will never take a class with him. I am very much disappointed with his class,"He is a pretty nice guy and wants people to learn.  His homework is worth 30% and you'll have 3 tests before the final worth about 10% each. The tests are heavily based on HW and his past exams, which personally I think is best, though you might have HW due the week of exam with material on the exam."

Wait a semester and get a real professor.","homework is not easy, and takes a long time to do it. hour exams is not hard if you study the quiz problems, but takes a long time to calculate. Bonus questions are pointless, you'll never know how to do it. However, this lecturer really teach you something. It's possible to get an A if you study hard.",He's the nicest professor I've ever have.,"Professor Mei was not the easiest teacher to understand, but he was able to get many things communicated effectively. His office hours were pretty helpful, though the homework was tough at times and the tests pushed you. Form a study group and you should be fine.",He gave very resonable tests. And you have chance to make up for your exams if you do good in your quiz. And he gave resonable curve. recommend him.,"This guy was horrible.

Lot of homework and the final project does take a couple hours, but isn't that expected?","Sometimes too slow. His iClicker questions are worded very vaguely and are usually presented before a topic is even taught, so it's generally hard to get them right.

BUT, the class is pretty easy if you go to lecture and keep up with the readings. The discussion sections are pointless but attendance is mandatory. It's a pretty easy A or B",Very good anecdotes made the class enjoyable and worth attending,"Lectures were interesting, but he comes across as a pretentious ****.","While all the grades were for written assignments, and while Meilleur does emphasize the craft or writing more than most professors, I don't think he is as difficult a grader as some have suggested.  He gives you a long, detailded list of formatting requirements, but his bark is definately worse than his bite.  Good lecturer.  Recommended.",No Comments,"Exremely hard grader.  Class is all papers so beware, dont take it if your not savvy on writing.  Cool guy, knows his subject well but dont be shocked if your write like Rousseau and still get hosed on his papers","If you are interested in politics, you will love the class. The lectures are very engaging and quizzes, tests and assignments are not difficult. And, he is incredibly sexy.","This was a very interesting course, but I have to agree going to the lectures doesn't help much- just read the book.

Also, the pop quizzes can be hard since some are about international politics and really who gives a crap...","ok,can he be more of an ass? i felt like i was in bootcamp the few times i actually went to his pointless lectures.

He only thinks he's clever, and he has nothing but contempt for students.",This class is pretty much a joke and going to lectures are pointless. He tries to make himself sound like a genius but could keep it much simpler. Your better off just reading the text.,"This is the only class I have ever taken that I look forward to going to.  Lectures are interesting, informative, and really leave you thinking about the subject.  Not to mention, Maurice is a ****.",The lectures is this class are very interesting. It's definitely a class that I can look forward to. This class take a very interesting look at American politics and will make you question yourself in one way or another.

I graduated two years ago, but he still recognizes me and asks about how I am doing and even remembers exactly what I AM doing now!  He's wonderful, and physio would have been awful if it wasnt for him!",Dr Meisami is a very nice guy but this class is not worth it for an elective.  He posts 10 page study guides a few days before the exam so by the time you fill out the very detailed answers there is no time to study.,"Definitely not an easy A kind of class. Meisami is a really cute old guy and funny to listen to, but its easy to fall asleep in class. His lectures aren't very organized and the majority of the material isn't covered in lecture. Be prepared to study a lot but don't try to do all the readings &amp; study guide unless you don't want to have a life",Dr. Meisami is one of the most interesting teachers I have had.  You can really tell he enjoys teaching. His lectures aren't mandatory to attend since he only covers a minimal amount of what is actually covered on the exam. Look up the information in the coloring book.  It's thorough and will prepare you for the exams.,He's a great guy and going to lecture was always interesting. With that said be prepared to teach yourself though because there is ALOT of material on the exams. Class consists of 4 exams and a cumulative final.,"It's a tough class, but I wouldn't want any other professor teaching it.  Meisami does an amazing job of teaching us about the human body.  The only grades are 5 exams.  There is no HW.  I will truely miss going to Meisami's lecture!",Probably the nicest man I've ever met in my life. He so genuinely cares about each and every one of his students. I had him over 3 semesters ago but I STILL go to his office hours just to talk when I can. You'll wish he taught every one of your classes.,"Class is challenging, but his lectures make up for it.  He goes at a good pace so that everyone can understand, he is extremely friendly and he reminds me of Yoda!  Tough class, great professor.","Cutest man alive!

He is the sweetest and most hilarious man ever.  He really cares about his students and wants them to perform well.,"Very interesting class with a great lecturer.

I followed her suggestions and she still was not happy with my final papers. Went from A to B-","Nice teacher keeps her material in order, tells you what you need for an A.","Before college, I use to hate writing/english classes.

Take Melnick.","Melnickian Awesomeness. you know what, we need to set up a shrine for him in Gregory hall","I'll never forget the time I saw him walking on the South Quad with that slow, meditative walk of his while smoking a cigarette. EPIC MOMENT. Great professor. His voice is so sexy, and he's borderline androgynous. You don't need to read the Republic or anything because he'll talk about it for weeks. Get a good, English-speaking TA.",Professor Melnick is looks and acts like Snape!,"Melnick is perhaps the best professor I have had in my college career.  His grasp of philosophical concepts is incredibly deep, and his ability to penetrate and clarify the meaning of the texts is second to none.  This man's intellect is in another plane of existence, and by simply taking his course, you may take a step closer to its lofty perch.",The greatest intellectual story time session of your life. Going to class stoned will only heighten your intellectual experience. Melnick is a very fair grader and knows a LOT about what he is teaching. Perhaps one of the most valuable courses I have taken. *Warning* class might make you question your faith.,"THE Best professor I have had. He has inspired me to be a philosophy major. Explains what we are reading so thoroughly, yet with great precision. I looked forward to going to his class every time.","This professor is UIUC best kept secret. So smart and explains all of the concepts. Its so funny, that I NEVER do the readings in the class, but once he gets to talking you ONLY want to go back and read more into the topic. Pretty pathetic, but Im actually dreading the end of this class, I wish he taught more. Don't debate, take this course!","So much fun! Such a blast coming to class. If you're into philosophy, you'll enjoy class with Melnick. You never know what's going to come out of his mouth. It's the kind of class where you wish there was a barcrawl at the end so you could make a t-shirt with all his amazing quotes.","I dont think its an easy class as people say. His lectures are boring most of the time, but he's such an adorable old man and he is clever and his witty jokes do make me laugh! He's super nice however his T.A. is the one that grades the take home essay exams. Just don't miss lecture and take as many good notes as possible!","Amazing professor, does a great job of going over some of the more complex concepts in the course.","Fantastic professor. Took his modern philosophy course and then this one on Kant. Amazing teaching ability and the main reason I decided to minor in philosophy. Lectures are extremely detailed and enriching. Funny guy. He and the courses may seem intimidating, but he makes the class very worthwhile.",His lectures fill you with knowledge of philosophy.,"He has quite a cult following. His class was easy to get an A in, with only two 'take-home' exams. He was kind of boring and his lectures were easy to fall asleep to, but still a very funny guy, especially when he would confuse himself. Take it for a good time.","Hilarious, clever, insanely well read in multiple subject matter. I loved all the courses ive had with him. He is by far the main reason I picked up a philosophy minor. He may come off as a bit intimidating at first, but he is a really great Professor and dont be scared to ask a question or see him for help he really is a friendly guy.","Melnick is the closest thing to opening up your skull and physically placing the information in your brain.  The things he talks about in class stay with you.  There's little class discussion, but only because he's so smart that all you want to do is listen.","One thing, this guy is a extremely relaxed. He lectures, and I never had to do the readings. He's a pretty easy grader, so no problem getting an A or an A- in his class.","Had him for 206 and a 300 class on kant.  dry wit and obvious disgust with life and idiocy are definite pluses.  gives very good, clear expository lectures, both on the cursory level (206) and a bit more in-depth (kant class). retarded churls that call him boring are fit for nothing more than slave-labor.  if you need to take 206, take him.",uses a lot of violent examples and analogies that make you wonder about his childhood. i dont know how the photographer managed to get him make that really happy face for his faculty pic. anyway i'm digressing. he's a really accomplished guy and makes sure you know what he's talking about during lectures. exams are fair and on the easy side

Do not take if you're looking for a laid-back class. You will have to work hard for an A","Horrible professor. Very tough grader, although comments made no sense. Didn't learn anything throughout the entire class. I was extremely disappointed since I was very interested in Victorian literature prior to this class, now I hate it. Picked bad poems to read, and assignments were unnecessarily long. Paper prompts weren't clear. STAY AWAY!!!!!","Mercado is such an excellent teacher. Eng 109 is introduction to fiction, and she does an excellent job of teaching students how to effectively pull meaning from the texts we read. Reading is required for every class, attendance is mandatory, although you get a few excused absences. You have to work for your grade, but it is definitely worth it.","Never ever gave an A. tons of drafts and always comments 'I don't follow'. Nice person while teaching,but tough in grading. I got C for the first paper, B- the second. If u expect a easy class, don't choose this one.","Way too much work for a simple 100 level class. There are five 600 word poetry responses and 2 4-6 page essays (in addition to the mid-term and final, in which you have to remember an entire catalouge of poetry, the authors, and the content). Looking for an easy class, please don't take this one."

Class was pretty hard, but he managed to keep it somewhat interesting",Worst professor on the face of this Earth. Avoid at all cost. A robot would probably show more emotion and enthusiasm than this guy.,Be prepared to learn from the book! Perhaps the worst lecturer I've had at UIUC. Bonus points for not speaking intelligible english.,"This guy will rip your soul away if you don't dedicate proper time to the course. Exams are unpredictable. He barely describes methods of proof used in the course, which is essential to learning. If you have to take him for 348/7, I suggest you become fully acquainted with methods of proof before taking the class. I retook 348 and got an A.","This is by far the most terrible class I've taken at uiuc.He basically takes a few examples from the textbook and that's it.

I recommend switching if you see him on your schedule. Smart guy (and he knows it), but doesn't seem to care about enlightening anyone but himself.",Don't. Just don't.,I would not recommend this professor to anyone or take this course again. He is not clear with expectations of the course and is not helpful for students. I regret taking this professor and would never choose him again. He can be condescending and extremely rude at times which makes for a hostile learning environment.,Can be very condescending and doesn't like interpretations of the text other than his own.

I took 460, literary editing with her. She always made sure that the selection process for pieces engaged with everyone's voice and opinion. Her organization is excellent, and she is very straightforward.","I have Natalie for three classes, and each of them were consistent in two things: one is that she ACTUALLY cares, and two is that she listens, which is so important when taking for-credit classes with high-participation and discussions.   With this particular class, just do the homework and respond, you don't even have to talk really.","Great class. Learned a lot of about the publishing/editing side of literature. Natalie does a good job balancing course work and real world experience. Definitely take this class if you're looking for great experience. Natalie is a fun and funny professor, definitely take CW460 with her.","I love Natalie! She has great comments and really listens to everyone's opinion on each piece. She counts credit if you do the commentary/voting thing, like, even last minute. She made me feel comfortable sharing my opinions on a certain piece, even if majority of the class didn't agree. Incredibly friendlyI would take it again with her!","She does love to talk, just participate and add to the environment she'll love you forever. She is a stickler so make sure you follow her guidelines correctly to get that A that is easily deserved. very free natured while rules and regulations on papers are what you make on your own just don't plagiarize.","She likes to talk, A LOT. Often times class would drag on because she would over discuss things that the class had nothing else to say on. She's loud, really loud. Cover your ears when she laughs. Also, she apparently doesn't like to hand out ""A's."" Her words, not mine. Which is a bunch of baloney, especially if someone earned it.","Nice, but too energetic sometimes"

I did get an A but, it was due to self study.","This is was the worst class I have ever taken at UIUC, I took it last year so it might have changed since then. The lectures are not helpful and just talk about the concept of something with fun demos. Then, in discussion they throw a bunch of problems and equations that you would have never seen before and quiz you on it. Worst class ever.","This class was kind of pain, he is a nice guy and easily approachable. His lectures are cool because he does a ton of demos, but they dont always help make the material more understandable because his explanations are confusing sometimes.","The professor is great. He's super nice and knowledgeable. But his exams are way harder than the practice problems he gives you and his lectures don't cover material that you're tested on. It feels like your taught about apples and tested on basketball. Also the discussion and the workbook don't help whatsoever. Overall, it's a very hard class.","He gets props because the lower level physics curriculum at u of I is about as good as it gets from a learning perspective. I.e. a few professors' research was based exclusively on how students learn best and making their class better (see smartphysics). I believe Jose himself didn't work on that, however his doctorate is in physics education. All in all he's no walter lewin, the man is simply your average very good physics professor. Can't really go wrong with him.","Honestly, Jose is probably the nicest professor out there. His lectures are always interesting and full of experiments. I didn't think he went into material that would be helpful on the quizzes or tests as much as he could have, so this class involved a lot of learning on your own.","I once was deaf, but the sweet remedy of jose's physics lecture cured me.

He'll give you a chance to re-do almost everything, and if you don't blow off projects, you should do fine in the class.","One of the three best professors I had at UIUC. Highly knowledgeable. Yes, he's tough and seems like he expects a lot from students. In actuality, he's tough because you're not going to learn this material in this much detail anywhere else. Dedicate time now to build a foundation and you will excel. Available out of class.","He's good at what he does but he's stuck in a specific design mode. Learn to do things his way to get the grade. Talks a lot and tends to rub people the wrong way. Crits are meh, somethings are interesting and helpful but mostly it's his design aesthetic you're trying to meet. I probably wouldn't take another class with him.","Had him for a discovery course, and he wasn't as organized as I would've liked. We had to put together a website and cover the 2012 election with another class. His instruction was scattered, and though it was an easy class, I'm not sure if I got much out of it. He shared what journalism was like and taught HTML to us. He's pretty hilarious, though","Despite the difficulty, Meyer really knows his stuff. The material in 425 is extremely useful. Plus, Meyer is freaking hilarious. Some people get upset by his funny, blunt critiques, but if you chill out and laugh along it's actually a fun class!","Lots of work, but you really learn a lot -- more than you do in almost any other class. Professor is very approachable and helpful in one-on-one situations, but students who aren't willing to work will really hate his class.","Sorry, I'm the below commenter, I just screwed up the whole number rating part... this is more like it. You learn a lot of extremely valuable things, you don't realize how much fun it can be because you are working at such a fast pace. Just tough it out and do the best you can.","Pompous, arrogant, impressed with his own ideas and has an inability to explain concepts clearly.

Critical but offers no real suggestions to improve. Drove me away from journalis","He's a mixed bag. On the one hand, he's a bit abrasive and can definitely rub people the wrong way.

The lectures for this class are awesome and really make you think. He is happy to answer all questions, in or outside of class and is really accessible. Some of the readings are 80+ pages so beware.","Best class that I have taken so far. It's very interactive and his lectures are more like casual discussions. As long as you do the work, it's not that hard to pass. Ben understands that we have other assignments and doesn't load us with much busy work. He also almost always lets us out of class early.","Ben is legit my favorite professor here. Super nice and very understanding. You have to go to class, do readings, and go to discussion, but there is a big extra credit project. He is always up to discussing anything outside of class and doesn't care about your grades, just wants you to learn. Anyone interested in poli sci needs to take his classes.","Ben is literally the best professor I've ever had. He makes classes simple by administering no exams, only a small amount of homework. Readings are very important but he also makes sure to make class extremely fun and helps you learn so much! Amazing personality, the only reason I get out of bed for class honestly","The class is really amazing! We discuss a lot of stuff like happiness and justice, which is not just limited to the ancient philosophy.  The class helps us to do critical thinking. Professor Miller is interesting and willing to help everyone."

Remember to keep checking compass for due dates, and to show up for class as much as possible!","Heather has been one of the best teachers for me. I have a learning disability and she has helped me through every class. Her classes are engaging, with no time to fall asleep out of boredom, because she asks us questions, ""What would you do in this situation...?""

Likes to make people feel stupid when they disagree with her or even if they don't. Literally only talks about GMO's. Just really rubbed me the wrong way.,Show up and complete the assignments and you will receive an A.,Very helpful and nice. Really knows her stuff.  She has a lot going on so it took forever for assignments to be graded. The class is very journalism-based so lots of writing and checking your sources.

He would often erase everything he had taught for most of a lecture, saying ""oh wait this is wrong."" AVOID AT ALL COSTS","DOES NOT SPEAK ENGLISH!  Avoid if it all possible - most teachers who don't speak English compensate by making the class rather easy. He compensates by being a MASSIVE JERK.

He focuses on the conceptual aspects on the Exams even though the HW was all about doing problems. Average on the Final waas 42.5%. Definitions and Theorem are always on the exams. He is very condescending and belittles you when you asked questions in Lecture. So be precise using Math terminology when asking q's,"Simply the worst teacher. He hates his students and writes sarcastic responses to those who email him for help, advice or questions. He will make mistakes all over the board and then hastily fix them half way through confusing the class. I had an 87 but the final was ridiculous and killed it to a C","Terrible.  Even if you know how to solve problems with calculus 3, you will still probably get a C because his exams are mostly definitions and proofs.  He spends most of his lecture time proving theoroms rather than actually showing you how to solve problems using the theoroms. The average for the final was 43%.  Enough said.",He prefers to teach theorems and definitions in lecture and then have TA's show you how to solve actual problems. Go to class and write down all theorems and definitions... memorize them... and you should do well on the tests... at least I did... I got A's on my tests...,"Studying for the first exam we asked the TA what he would do in our place.

Also, do the homework/read the book.",Horrible teacher. Tests have very little to do with the material that has been taught. It's easier learning from the book.  Basically... avoid him at all costs.,"HORRIBLE teacher! just try to AVOID him! his exam is 50% theorem and definition, if he ask you to state the def of something, don't try to put theorem instead! you will get ""a line"" or a ""0"" for it w/ NO partial credit at all!!! also his hw is looonnng like a minimum of 3 pages each. lecture sucks, he just restate the theorem and def from book!",He wants to see you fail.  He lets you drop a midterm just in case you miss one he can say no retakes.  Just try answering one of his questions in class.  I dare you.  He will shoot you down and it will be pretty funny.  His tests are not too hard though.,Terrible Prof. who doesn't really care to help.  You are better off trying to learn the material just from the text book then from him,"Igor is an absolutely terrible professor, if you can't get into another section, either wait and take the class a different semester or try and take it over the summer. It is not worth the pain that is his class. He is the most rude professor I have ever met and is very demeaning towards the students. Tests are ridiculous.","He is by FAR the worst teacher in the world.  Dont ever take a class with Igor.  If its not possible to aviod him, wait and take the class later.",Igor is the worst teacher I have had in my life. His accent isn't terrible but adds to my dislike. His lectures do not flow together at all. He just writes stuff on the board and does not explain what you would use it for.

Tests are very low averages with a high curve (the only thing saving my grade).","Ray was not the best yet not the worst. This was his first year with this course and textbook so it was a little rough. Tries to engage students but content was boring and he's not the best presenter.

I really like him as a person but I wouldn't recommend him as a professor unless you do particularly well with Chinese accents.,"""What?? What did he just say???"" comprises much of what you will be asking yourself during lecture. Honestly, if he didn't have such a thick accent, he might have been a good professor. His exams are relatively easy.","I could NOT understand him at all. He has a thick accent, and no one knew when he was asking a question. He is obsessed with Papayas, and only talks about them. He is really nice, but just not who I wanted to teach me genetics.",HIS portion of genetics is really easy but the second half (with a different professor) is much worse and way more boring. He loves to talk about papayas and relate them to lecture

Turns out he does not care and is extremely rude outside of class. Really bummed because he seemed so likable at first but he is very judgmental and shows he could not care less about his students as individuals. Real let down.,"I've taken this class in the past and he seems more strict than the other instructor I've had before. He seems really chill, but at the same time seems like he has really high expectations for the students. I felt like my comments were never good enough or ever met his expectations. I kind of feel like he would judge me on what I said.","Matt is an outstanding instructor who acknowledges how undefined poetry really is as an art form. One of the more honest folks you can get as an instructor, and someone who will meet with you any time during the semester to check out other work you're doing aside from class work.","Matt was one of my favorite teachers. He's from Boston and grades very easily. Having said that, you have a lot of interesting discussions and I actually liked writing papers for him.","Mr Minicucci is AWESOME!!! He is soooooo nice and funny and very helpful!! He seems to love his job and he is always there for you if you need something. The atmosphere in class is great and that's why I think you learn a lot without bein aware of it. I LOVE his class, always looking forward to going there =)",Matt is awesome.

He seems to be teaching ""on the fly"", as if he Didn't review the lecture before class. He uses the lecture notes of other teachers, which is very confusing. He is essentially teaching someone else's course. Very nervous when teaching and doing problems"

He's also never around besides when he teaches the class, so you can't get help from him. However, he lets you redo the projects until you get them right",..,"nice guy but his CAD/Revit class is pretty boring. The assignments are easy and fun, but at times can get a little time consuming.

Her voice and teaching is pretty clear. She is very patient.,"Great professor. Makes the class interesting. Tests, though, are a bit tougher than what I expected. No need for the textbook, even tough its recommended.",Good sense of humor: I specifically picked one of her classes because of this.  No textbook but there were still readings for each lecture which where incredibly boring. Good turnaround on grading. Genuinely wants students to be critical thinkers and to succeed.  I'll probably take anoher of her classes.,H.H. is very excited about the material she teaches. She makes a class about Baroque Architecture interesting. She also genuinely cares about her students and takes time to get to know hundreds of them at a time.,"Professor Minor is a terrific professor who carefully balances humor and learning, making for a very interesting class! She will always make time to meet with any student and she loves when students come office hours to ask questions, or just chat. She is also a very fair grader, as she allows for a fair amount of flexibility in projects and tests.",I took her again because she is the best at this school. This class had really boring material that worked against her but she tired her best to get us excited and made it as painless as possible. The final was 5% of your grade and actually worth sitting down and writing. She is involved and dedicated- everything you want in a professor,"Best professor I've had so far!  She maintains a seriousness about architecture while having a hilarious sense of humor.  You can expect clear, knowledgeable and interesting lectures and fair, straightforward exams.",I'm having a blast in her class. She makes the class funny and relevant.

I LOVED this class. Her lectures are incredibly interesting and she really knows what she is talking about. She also makes herself very accessible if you have a problem or want to know more about something. I LOVED this class. There's a good amount of reading but if you do the work you'll get a good grade,"I have taken three classes with this teacher (Arch 210, 407, 414) and I have been more than pleased with each course.  There is no need to purchase textbooks and even though there is a fair amount of reading, you will not be disappointed with what you learn!","Best professor I have had at UofI. The material is interesting and she has a very laid back approach. The grading is not tough either, just a fair amount of reading.",I had Professor Minor for two courses: Arch 210 Intro to History and Arch 414 Baroque and Rococo. She is more of a senior level professor. She is a bad introductory level professor but is very interesting in more in depth material such as is presented in Arch 414. Just don't take her 210 course.,"Minor was a great professor. she was so into what she was teaching and offered her own insights, all while keeping the class entertained with funny jokes. She makes history interesting and fun","Awesome professor! (And she actually IS a professor, has a PHD). Probably one of the best in the Architecture department at UIUC.

A Published writer and my favorite professor.",Professor Miraftab is very knowledgable and passionate in her teachings. This class if full of eye opening material. There is a small quiz every other week on average and one paper. You do have to work for your grade as there is only 100 points total in the class. I would recommend this course to anyone who has interest in global cities.,Professor Miraftab is very knowledgeable in this subject. She is very passionate and enjoys what she teaches. She makes herself available as long as you show interest in the subject and/or your grade. The readings she assigns relate to the topics covered in class and are necessary for the quizzes.,"She taught this class well, if the little description blurb in the registrar interests you then you will enjoy this class. Most of the quizzes you don't even need to do the reading to do well on, it's just common sense.","I loved the way her lectures were always so interesting. She is a very experienced woman, and you can see her passion for the topics discussed in class. Your perspective of the world will really change and you'll understand a lot more about the way things work. Even the assignments were engaging. Just be ready to talk about the readings in class!","Professor Miraftab is a wonderful teacher. She teaches passionately about the materials in this class. The assignments and readings aren't that hard, but it is important that you ATTEND class. She usually reviews the assigned materials for the  session in class, so you don't really have to do all of the readings. Overall, UP185 is a chill class.","Great content.

She has a no screens policy but apparently that doesn't apply to people who use iPads. She will also waste class time ranting about phones and waiting for people to ask/answer questions even though no one wants to. She  has picked out people who obviously had nothing to say.","Although I found the topics discussed in class interesting, I could not handle how confusing Professor Faranak was and ultimately dropped the class. The confusion she causes when asked a question makes asking questions almost useless, she really just reiterates what she just said. Attendance is mandatory and she expects participation.","The class is fairly easy, but the professor is ridiculous. She's really bad at explaining her expectations and is really needy when it comes to classroom discussion/interaction, so get on her good side by talking a lot and going to office hours. Projects are pretty easy and the finals are essay format.","Totally unorganized. Not a hard class though. Interesting, but hard to figure out what's going on in the class.

If you need an extension on any papers, she will gladly give it to you. Her lectures are boring, she has a thick accent, and babbles a lot. But overall she's a good teacher. You get two excused absences for the semester, every absence after that she subtracts a third of a letter grade.","Zia is super lenient with grading and speeches.

He covers so much material and the lectures feel rushed.,His 8 am lectures don't help in a class as tough as orgo 2. Tests way tougher than lecture Material. Tough grader,"CHEM 436 covers a lot of material. However, Mitchell covers everything you need to know for the exams in lecture. Very clear and concise presentation of material. Sometimes he glosses over details in drawing mechanisms and steps become difficult to follow. However, it's clear that he makes an effort to help students succeed.",Tough but fun.,"Orgo is hard. He tells you to work through the book problems in addition to everything else, which I did, and my grade went up. Still a challenging subject but he cares about YOU learning chemistry","He was very helpful (especially given an 8 am) when asked questions. However, his lecture material was extremely unorganized. I've never had classes as unorganized as this. Essentially each exam he tells you ""you need to know everything"" when you don't, but it can be tough to decipher what he finds as important.","So far he's a pretty gnarly dude.I would like it if he could clarify some topics,but there's only so much you can do in a 50 minute lecture.Ask him questions outside of class and he's more than willing to help.Make sure to read the text and due extra problems.It's a challenging class but so far very rewarding and applicable to life-science topics."

Her quizzes were a little tough, but if you took good notes and skimmed the book, it shouldn't be hard to pass them considering that the quizzes were online and open note. She also offered so much extra credit to help out. Lectures okay, class overall easy.","tale's class started off very simple, however her quizzes do not correspond to her lessons in the book or the quizzes. Her tests are confusing and badly written. I studied for hours and got a disappointing grade. She is extremely unhelpful and her lectures are dry, boring, and pointless. I recommend taking this class with a different professor.",Keeps the lectures very entertaining. Funny with great examples.
772898,4.5,Ani,Mitra,2,0.46484769377800633,He is one of the best out of a bad bunch of TA's. At least you can understand his english. He is good at explaining concepts (basically yells).

He's trying to make the class engaging and interesting.",I was a big fan of his lecturing style.  He was a great public speaker and his lecturing made up for the content of the actual lectures.  My favorite professor all year.  Made the lectures worth going to.,"Mitra is a great professor that explains the concepts very well. If you know coding you can easily get by in this class without attending lectures. Despite the lecturer's being great, the class is structured pretty poorly which is where most of the complaints come from. He is the best choice for ECE 220.","Lectures are a waste of time, just read the textbook. This class is arguably even easier than 110.","Professor Mitra is very friendly and tries to engage his students during lecture. I felt that his lectures were organized and understandable. He introduced many programming examples during lecture, which were helpful for doing MP's.",I had a very good experience with him. Definitely very helpful and extremely easy to understand.,"True baller. Went to like 1 lecture cause the class was super easy, wish they were harder cause his teaching abilities would have been useful. Fun class.",He is one of the best professor in ECE department. Clear and diligent. Much better than another guy who teaches the same class.,"Mitra was a rocking professor.

The content was kind of all over the place but it was always interesting, and she's also a really nice person.",Super easy class. One group project and a few tests (they are all taken in class and are simple). Attendance is not mandatory,"Really easy, tries to help the whole class get A's.",Literally probably the easiest class in the history of easy gen eds!!! The median for the third exam was a 100%.. and she pretty much tells you in lecture what questions will be on the exam. Every true false question is always true.. she says so herself haha. Watched popular movies like Django the Artist and Winters bone,"This is the easiest class I've taken. Ever. Mobley is a good teacher. She wants everyone to get an A, and will drop grades or curve scores even though it's so incredibly easy. I really enjoyed most of the films we watched too. Oh and you never have to attend class.","If you get Mobley for MACS !00, I advise you NOT to take it. The movies are not ""Popular"". They are almost all Asian and African American films, which does not fit the description of the class. Try and get a different teacher. She is odd and disorganized as well.

Worst teacher I've ever met!","This professor seems very unprepared at times. In more than one lecture, he could not figure out how to derive certain theorems, and left the class very confused. He posted a ""mock"" final but failed to provide the class with the solution; basically it doesn't seem like he cares about his students at all. He acts like teaching is a chore to him.",He is undoubtedly the worst professor I have ever had.  He is very unclear during lectures he speaks at the board and has terrible handwriting.  The exams seem fair until you receive them back and he took off more than half of the points for one computation error.  DO NOT TAKE ANY CLASS WITH HIM,He literally has no accent and doesn't speak into the board at all. He always articulates every word super clearly and everything he says is totally relevant to the current topic. His handwriting is also like high-definition clear. I never have any trouble reading what he writes. He's so good that nobody ever misses class. Basically this guy sucks.,He is not the best professor for linear algebra. AVOID IF POSSIBLE!,"This professor is very hard to understand at times. He definitely knows material but fails to communicate well with students. Exam questions usually have a proof or two, which is unfair considering proofs take a while to think about. This leads to an unfair score overall on the exam. Office hours are unhelpful; I don't recommend this professor.",Pretty much the most useless professor out there.  He rambles on in his lectures which is very hard to follow.  Homework is pretty much all theoretical.  Exams are hard and graded absurdly.  Two arithmatic mistakes result in half credit for each exam problem.  There are 5 questions on his exams and 2/5 of them are long and hard proofs.,awful at explaining basically reads from textbook. exams were okay but graded absurdly. got lower than 50 on all and ended up with an A.,"-Uses the word ""basically"" 25x per lecture and can't teach so horrible"

2235359,3.0,Jillian,Moga,2,0.5766643031634953,I enjoyed my time with Prof Moga. The material she covers is highly relevant and important for learning how to navigate multi-cultural spaces. The readings she assigns are interesting and she provides accompanying questions to help you recognize the key points. She is also funny and very caring towards her students.,"For a 200 level class, there is A LOT of reading. The readings are often boring and to me don't really cover anything. Also, I feel like this class can be a lot more enjoyable if particular concepts are not over analyzed during lecture. With the over analyzing, it makes particular concepts a lot more confusing and complicated to understand."
1366546,3.6,Feisal,Mohamed,7,0.5629624498343175,"His lectures are really easy to follow and if you pay attention during lecture you'll know just about everything you need to for the tests. The only bad thing about this guy is that he calls on two people to lead lecture every class, so if you don't do the reading I wouldn't suggest attending class.","Really knows his stuff--a joy to have as a professor. Always kept discussion interesting and engaging for students (or for those who bothered to show up, anyway). His grading system plays to your strengths, but he is not an ""easy grader"" (he also shouldn't be in a 400-level Shakespeare class). Overall, it was a very enjoyable class.","A very smart guy, and although he grades the papers somewhat tough, he has a very fair grading system overall. He's funny, learns names very quickly, and always keeps class interesting.","A true intellectual and great demeanor, but beneath it all, a warrior. Milton is tough, and with Mohamed, it is extremely tough. Does a good job of explaining the material, but expects a whole lot from you when it comes to papers, and especially exams. His grading scale is exceptionally fair, giving more weight to your strengths (exams, papers, etc","He made this class much to difficult for basic english. He is a tough grader and tests are 100% written. Doesn't take attendance but still grades you on participation.  Overall, don't take this class if you are looking to fill your english requirement, it's quite hard.",,"If early Brit Lit isn't your thing, you'll never love it.  But, Mohamed makes it about as interesting for the non-fanatic as possible.  Tests are straight-forward.  I didn't always do the reading but you probably should.

But it did make his class interesting.,"Well versed, and while I didn't always agree with his point of view on some topics, he explained himself well. He also presented the material in a very clear manner that was easy to follow.","Great professor! He has a TON of experience in the field, and is a well-known author.

She reads directly off lecture notes, and directly from the text book. Monotone. Boring. Seems pretty stupid... Any English student is capable of doing what she does. Easy essay grader too.","Was surprised to see a bad rating.  I took her major author's class on Willa Cather and thought she was very passionate, engaging, and, most importantly, interested in her students.  Perhaps it's better to take a higher level class with her.",Makes me love Cather!,Quite possibly the least engaging professor/teacher I have ever had. Most cut and dry class ever....super boring. You will never feel like doing the work. You are required to do compass posts as well. Easily could be an online class. In class discussions add nothing to the class at all.

As an intro class she did a good job of discussing a wide array of topics. Her class helped me form my identity as a latina. Assignments were easy and attendance policy is not crazy, although it is mandatory.","Professor Molina knows absolutely nothing about cinema.  She does not know how to teach a class, nor is she able to command the respect of her students.  She also thinks that a D is an adequate grade to receive on a paper.  DO NOT TAKE A CLASS WITH HER.","Overall just ok.

She made me not want to learn. she is a disgrace to be called a professor and even more a latina","I know more about Latino history than this terrible professor.  She obviously has no background in the field and makes stuff up as she goes along.  I was embarrassed for her when students would ask questions and she'd give the wrong answers, and the right answers were in the reading she assigned! Never taking LLS again because of her.",this class is terrible its not an easy A at all do not take for a gen ed. in lecture she didn't engage us at all and was very bias. the TA's were terrible too i had sonia and she was the worst TA ever she thought she knew everything and made class seem more of a debate then a learning enviroment DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS,"her class honestly is boring, her TA, Trini sucks and she has a horrible way of teaching.

Disorganized class and a disappoitnting conclusion.,"one of the strongest dancers on the political science faculty. although he is not classically trained as a dancer, his raw talent is eye-popping. it also makes for effective teaching. in my intro class, the prof tried to explain the condorcet jury theory 1000 times. mondak taught it 1 time thru interpretive dance. i will remember it now forever","mondak's summer class is a feast for the mind AND a feast for the eye. at first, i was puzzled that the class was scheduled to meet at the beach. but on the first day mondak gave an epic lecture on the problems of american politics in rhinestone covered speedo. not even james madison could rival this display of political prowess.",it is difficult to know if he is a man or a god. especially difficult on fridays because he wears a He-Man costume. take the politics of dance. you will learn a ton from his interpretative dance stylings (especially the dance about money in politics). this guy can really shake it. he earns every dollar. encore! encore!,this was the most demanding course I have ever took. But it made a man out of me. And the feats of strength which are legendary around here lived up to the hipe. i grew up in the yukon and i have seen men wrestle bears and win before. but i have never seen a man dominate a bear like mondak did. bonus points for wearing bedazzled wrestling tunic,"mondak's ability to interpret the complexities of politics through performative dance is second to none. i have have seen many poli sci profs here try to convey lessons thru dance and fail hard. not him. also, his dancing demonstrates the dignity and grace that one would expect from a scholar and a gentleman, despite what some may think.","Just completed Mondak's ""politics of good and evil"" special topics course. it combined biblical wisdom with raunchy Magic Mike style dancing. i noticed on the syllabus that mondak calls himself an endowed chair of political science. after this class i know why.","Mondak looks like he has been cut from stone and stuffed into spandex. He looks like an old school American Gladiator. Just as impressively, when he lectures, his voice sounds just like the Cookie Monster. That takes some getting used to. But he is a gifted lecturer. And he knows so much stuff about politics. Like stuff I had never heard of.",The semester is only half over but this has been one of the most profound experiences of my life. Professor Mondak is a breath taking combination of Konan the Barbarian and Winston Churchill. He has the rippling muscles of Konan and wisdom of Churchill. Good thing it's not the other way around. Especially cuz he wears those buckskin leggings.,"I took this class during summer session thinking it would be a breeze.  But on the first day of class, Mondak--aka the Hulk--smashed a two-by-four with his bare hands and screamed ""You do not want to mess with the warrior!"" Needless to say, there were no discipline problems in the class. he did lighten the mood with jokes and gave great lectures",Mondak defies categorization.  He has both brains and brawn.  He is both a warrior and a diplomat.  He is both beauty and the beast.  His lectures on politics will expand your mind.  His feats of strength will blow your mind.  Imagine a hairless gorilla with opposable thumbs and vast knowledge of politics.  That is Dr. Mondak.,"Although many of my classmates were most impressed by some combination of Mondak's bulging muscles, skin-tight buckskin leggings, and mastery of political knowledge, I will remember him most for his soulfulness.  On the last day of class he sang a wistful version of Bob Seager's ""Like a Rock.""  I cried without shame.","Dr. Mondak goes above and beyond for this students.  When we all showed for class and door to the room was locked, he smashed through the wall like Kool-Aid man.  Then he dusted himself off and led the class in an epic discussion where the United States is headed as a country. He shows us brawn and brains each day and he is a great American.",mondak is an amazing lecturer and strong like a bull.  but i thought the day he carried the refrigerator across campus was a rare miss.  sure it was impressive to see him pick it up over his head and run down the quad with it and then up all those stairs.  but it took like 20 minutes and he has nothing to prove.  nobody doubts his god like power.,the group project was terrible.  i was in a group of 3 and i felt like i was the middle link in a human centipede.  but mondak was awesome.  he juggled bowling balls while lecturing about voting behavior.  he carried a refrigerator across campus and up 4 flights of stairs then taught us about political parties.  he made learning fun.,"Mondak's classes are intense but ultimately good for you.  Before spring break, he overheard some of us saying we were not in shape for wearing swimming suits on spring break.  He then made the whole class run in place all class period long the whole week before break.  The class has helped me learn about politics.  I have also lost 12 pounds.","My favorite part of any day of class with Dr. Mondak is that when he make a really good point, he flexes his massive biceps and pounds his chest with pride like a gorilla.    On average, he makes about 5 to 10 really good points EVERY class.  It is impossible to zone out because the flexing and chest pounding keeps everyone really focused.","Dr. Mondak may be strong, speedy, and agile, but it is his lung capacity that impresses me most.  Yesterday, he challenged the whole class to see if anyone could hold their breath longer than him.  The kid next to me lasted the longest.  Then he starting shaking and turning red.  Mondak won easily, inhaled, and then gave a brilliant lecture ."

WORST EVER.,"Not a good professor. If you get a manual, you can do fine in the class, but he just cannot explain things well.

I STRONGLY suggest another professor.,"He's not as bad as everyone says. Even though you dont have to go to class, I recommend you do. He does some of the online homework in class.

At first it was decent, but as the semester wore on his funky accent got old and going to class became a chore if I ever actually went. Spare yourself from this class if you can! I got stuck in it because I had to get enough credit hours and this was all I could find! If you can avoid taking the class with him, please do it!","He is a nice guy, but not a great teacher.  Lectures were very boring and tests difficult.  The book was pretty atrocious.  He loves ice cream cones.","He is a really nice person, and as someone who took AP Stats in HS, I know stats reasonably well. Part of the problem his methods are VERY outdated- he doesn't seem to know how to use a calculator for statistical solutions.

Everything you need to know for the exams is in the powerpoints, so you don't even need to take notes. She's a picky grader and takes off points for stupid things in the homework assignments.","Good professor. I took linguistics 250 and I found it a little bit difficult. So much material in one class. Exams are not difficult, but you have to understand the concepts and practice, practice and practice. She is always accessible and helpful. My TA was excellent and patient. There are 4 homework packages but there aren't difficult."

Shes very engaged and interested in her topic and is obviously very passionate about what she teaches. I really enjoyed ANTH 399 anthropology of crime with her! No exams, but there is quite a bit of writing!",Fun and easy class. Do the readings and pay attention to the slides in class and you'll be fine. There are lots of opportunities for extra credit. Two exams and two papers. Exams are easy and she gives you a study guide.,"Not a lot of chances to get grades up, only two tests and 2 papers. Her lectures weren't very interesting which made it hard to pay attention but the content wasn't too difficult. The tests were hard and I would recommend studying hard and taking advantage of extra credit opportunities.",We spend more than half of lecture days watching movies. These courses cost alot of money and I would prefer to actually learn instead of watching a cheap documentary that I can find online. The other half of the time is spent with the professor reading directly off a sheet of paper. The class as a whole lacks direction and overall is very boring,"I'm not sure why she's rated so low, I guess freshmen are just a bit whiny. But she is amazing! She was very helpful and interesting, and she helped us to keep open minds about the different subjects covered. Definitely one of my favorite anthropology professors!",she thinks everyone should have this class at the top of their list. but really i wrote each of the papers in about 2 hours and crammed the night before for both exams. attendance is not mandatory but she does have random (and annoying) pop quizzes about every 2 weeks. couldn't stay awake in lecture to save my life,I have to force myself to attend each lecture. Difficult to take notes in class considering all of her powerpoints are made up of cartoons but class is still mandatory since there are pop quizzes. You don't really have to do the readings. I do not feel as though I learned anything new the entire semester.,She gets really sidetracked. Has negative opinions about students. Random pop quizzes. Test are easy. I have to practically duct tape my eyes to stay awake during lecture.,"Prof Moodie is enthusiastic about her subject and wants students to do well. The subject matter is easy (and interesting if culture is your thing). She is occasionally opinionated, but otherwise has a good personality. The class's main downfall was the amount of students who didn't want to be there and were subsequently unenthusiastic and whiny.","Her lectures are hard to follow (at least I thought so).  It seems as if she's reading them word for word off a piece of paper.  Tests are fairly easy, and I never did the reading.  I did go to class everyday though.","unbelievably boring class... but so easy that it's worth taking. going to class is mandatory, but it's okay because if you pay attention you won't have to read the hw. there's a 2 and 3 page paper, a midterm, and the final, both of which are multiple choice and really easy.",Boring class. You have to attend she gives out random pop quizzes. she talks A LOT!!! and repeats everything she says 50 different times. my friend and i use to hate going to that class because it was sooo worthless!,Easy class. Go to lecture cuz she gives random pop quizzes. She really wants her students to do well but tries to hard to get people motivated in class.,"Must go to class b/c of pop quizzes. The lecture itself is boring but i always paid attention instead of doing the reading. There is a ton of assigned reading, but you don't have to do any of it to do well on the final/midterm. Easy A !",You do not need to read a thing for this class. She summarizes almost everything as much as you need to know it for the exam. The review days before the midterm and the exam are EXTREMELY helpful. Online exercises give you the answers. Easy A!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Azucar sums it up.,"i went to her for help to proofread a paper and she didn't help at all, but instead imposed her own opinions. she tries too hard to get us to pay attention and thinks we're stupid when we don't answer her questions, btu really its cuz we lost interest a half hour before that. she never lets us out early either. easygoing class tho fulfills 3 geneds",The most boring class I have so far taken. The only reason to go is for the pop quizzes. The tests are a joke and as long as you have semi-read everything you'll get an A. It sometimes got pathetic how hard she tried to get the class motivated.,"I did not like this teacher at all. She was extremely opinionated and not open to discussion if people disagreed with her. She was very patronizing and seemed to dislike the majority of her students. Exams were really easy, and attendance is only necessary for the pop quizzes.","Moodie wants her students to do well, but contrary to the other student's opinion they are not stupid if they don't.  Its an  easy class, but Moodie places way too much importance on it.  she thinks everyone should be majoring in it, plus if people do not share her views she thinks they are uneducated.  Overall, easy class, but waste of time."

The material is pretty easy. The most annoying thing about this class is that you can't understand what hes saying unless you pay close attention.  He is foreign so he speaks with a soft accent. The guy knows his material esp. since he studied at MIT.  Gives extra credit the class is easy the final was tough.,"Great guy, really takes an interest in the subject of structures and can tell he wants his students to share the same great experience. He is sometimes hard to understand, but his drawings help clarify things. The T.A.s are great and grade very fairly.","Very Helpful, patient, and decent standard.  However, he cannot speak the language very well.  Tests are based primarily on lecture material, and lectures are sometimes very difficult to understand because of language barrier.

He would ignore the syllabus until the last minute; we had to complete a project in one weekend that other studios had two weeks to complete.  As mentioned, he does try to get students to drop; he attempted to get me to drop three weeks before the class ended.  Nice man, bad teacher.","Mooney is the dumbest living person available to teach at the University of Illinois. Please note that he is completely oblivious to this fact.

I took an introductory creative process studio with him before deciding on architecture as my major and it was one of my favorite classes I ever took.  He was very helpful in guiding you through each project, and helping you see your projects in different ways.","Bob Mooney has found in architecture the one thing in the world that he is completely unsuited for.

The online format of Orgo actually made it easier for me to see the molecular orbitals and where they molecules connected.  If you put the time and effort into his classes you can get A's.","I took both O-CHEMs and they were both pretty difficult. Moore is a very intelligent professor, but this class SHOULD NOT be online whatsoever. A class like this needs to be taught in a lecture hall/discussion room where visualizations can easily be accessed and seen.","This was by far my fav chemistry class. Moore is genuinely interested in student success despite what people have been saying so if you put in the effort and show to him you care, he will go above and beyond to help you out so you can succeed. Dave Song and Mike Evans are also awesome and very helpful.","There are so many bad reviews here... professor moore is a great teacher. although online course has its flaws, this is NOT a completely online course. there are discussions in person as well as review sessions. many people giving bad reviews probably just did online hw and crammed before each test.",Absolutely horrible professor. He was rude and didn't care at all about his students learning. I would NEVER take another class offered by him.,"Prof. Moore gives UofI a bad appearance. This class was thrown together as he admitted. It was not even ready, but I guess the university had no other alternatives. All he cares about is his research. HE DOES NOT CARE ABOUT YOU! Remember: This was a grad students project. The only time you'll ever see him is on the first day and in the videos.",Organic chemistry obviously isn't supposed to be easy.  The online format of the class was a lot better than i expected.  I thought it was helpful to be able to watch the lectures whenever i wanted and to pause and go back to take good notes.  i learned a lot and i recommend his class!,"Honestly, this class was pretty difficult, but Professor Moore made me realize how much I actually like Organic Chemistry after Miller destroyed it for me.  This class actually connects to real life instead of just carbons and hydrogens.  Watch the lectures, go to the test review sessions, and SI and you will do fine!","worst professor I've had so far. online lectures are useless. online exams are nerve-racking and do not reflect class material well. not very helpful, never uses enough examples. goes over important materials too quickly. doesn't seem like he really enjoys or wants to teach you, pawns work off on assistants. stay away...","Amazing professor. Probably the best teacher I have ever had. The material is difficult, but he teaches it very well and makes sure you know it. He applies the material to everyday news and makes it interesting. I wish all professors were this good.","Jeff Moore is quite possibly the best professor at UIUC.  Although his courses are extremely tough, he has integrated great interactive material into his teachings, quizes, and exams.  I think the online style is a little easier than the old paper form exams, for everyone can now use notes at all times.",Very enthusiastic about the course.  ACE Organic is great useful.  You definately need to watch all lectures.,"Professor Moore is an amazing man. He cares so much about his students and tries his very best to help them. He is excellent at explaining the topics covered in class. Course material is extremely difficult, but that is the nature of organic chemistry.",Prof Moore is one of the nicest profs I've had. He really cares about his students and loves what he teaches. He provides numerous resources in case you need help.

I hated gen chem but loved this class.,kind and considerate. precise and intelligent. this professor is what every professor ought to be.,Jeffrey Moore is a man of power and intellect.  He's the best professor I've had in awhile.  He's very good at drawing structures and videotapes his lectures.,"What a doll.  Dr. Moore is such an extraordinary individual - so dedicated to his students, yet an incredibly accomplished and admired chemist in the world of research.  The class is challenging, the tests are hard, but he is never ambiguous about what his expectations are.  Wouldn't be surprised if there was a Nobel in his future - don't miss him!","Very nice and honest about what he expects from his students.

I would say that the class is meant for people that have taken three or four years of Spanish prior, so if you have difficulty with comprehension when speaking with a native speaker, you might have to ask her to repeat herself because the class is taught in Spanish, but she helpfully does.","A helpful and nice TA. This class basically reviews the grammar (not vocab) covered in SPAN122 and SPAN103, so the level of difficulty is comparable to those two classes. Online homework is annoying but easy. Grade consists of 2 exams, participation, written homework assignments, and online homework and discussions.","In a lab, on computers. Class is mandatory becuase you submit class work on compass for points.  Readings are useless, I got an A and never read any. She's a fair/easy grader on papers.

She talks down on everyone who doesn't see things her way and can't find multiple ways of presenting information.

It probably helps to have an interest in the topic, but Professor Morrissey could probably make anything interesting and enjoyable. He is incredibly nice, intelligent, and caring about the topic and his students. By far my favorite professor at UIUC.",Morrissey is the best professor I had while at U of I. I took four of his classes for my history minor and  he is so engaging and incredibly knowledgeable. He is very approachable and accessible for office hours. You are missing out if you do not take his course. His lectures are so great and inspiring.

Homeworks were around 10 questions per week. For those of you who found it hard, maybe it's because you are BAD.",Mortensen is a genuinely caring person. Office hours helps because she goes around to everyone and helps you out if you need it. There are 3 midterms are 15% each and the final is 30% so there's a lot of weight in the exams and the material can be hard sometimes so it's probably best to go to lecture too. Otherwise she's really nice and is helpful.,Extremely helpful and thorough explanations.,"MATH 210 is a required class to transfer into acturial science, so you would think they would have a good teacher, but Dr. Mortensen was not. She constantly made mistakes during lectures and the tests were unpredictable. The first one was easy while the last one was ridiculously tough. I went in for help multiple times and it barely helped.","She's great! One of the only math professors I've had who does not have a thick accent, so it's easy to understand her. She moves through the material at an appropriate pace and makes sure you actually understand what she is teaching","Wonderful lecturer, and very nice woman. Explains topics with clarity and concision.","Really wants you to learn, and is always available for help. Great explanation, filled with examples. I would gladly take her class again.","Concepts were presented with many examples, often these would show up on exams or quizzes.  Definitely look for past exams online to prepare for tests - better than looking at past worksheets and quizzes in my opinion.","She is really considering and she really cares her students. She explains all the concepts pretty well. Information for exams are also clear and helpful. She has a certain style for the exams so if you do the past exams she made(find them online), you'll do well. You also need to pay attention in lectures and do homework tho, cuz they help a lot.","If you know calc from high school, this class will be really easy for you. If not, you really need to work for it and Mortensen wants you to succeed. She is mostly clear and in a slow pace in her lectures and her exams are actually quite easy compared to other instructors. I would recommend her but you will need to work  A LOT because it is calc.",This class is difficult. Do not take this as an easy class even if you are good at Calc; you have to put in A LOT of work and the professor isn't really helpful.  The TA's are more helpful than the instructor.,"doesn't know the material well, my high school calculus teacher was much better","This rating applies to the Mathematica version of MATH 415 (linear algebra). Mortenson's lectures are very clear and many students did very well in her class. I, on the other hand, struggled partly because of the strong focus on concepts. I do recommend Mortenson as a professor for this class.",easy A  explains really well and goes at a snail pace,"Test are easy if you study and go to class, lectures are somewhat dull but she does explain concepts clearly.","The course is very easy, but her explanation are too specific. It bored me a lot.",Super easy class and nice teacher. For the tests you must memorize the definitions!!,"Dr. Mortenson was EXTREMELY easy. She cares about her students performance and is really nice. Sometimes it seemed to me like she was afraid of our class though. Easy exams, easy quizzes, and no homework!","Dr.Mortensen is soooo amazing! She is a very good instructor and she geniunely cares about how her students do. Whenever I went to go for help, she was always available and nice. Her presentations is very clear and her tests are very easy. If you go to the lectures and discussions and do your homework, then you will be fine. I love math now!","You definitely don't have to go to lectures to actually do well. She made a lot of mistakes, especially on the review packets... She just couldn't seem to get the right answer the first time and that was frustrating. Just one exam was tricky (all definitions, very little calculation), and the final was pretty straightforward."

Get ready and concentrate, phones away and you'll be OK. Mandatory participation, essays not very hard if you just learn through the PPT ---- you don't even have to read closely to get an A. BTW, No extra credits.","40% of the course is just clicker points and attendance, so you get points just for showing up, however VERY few other grades - 60% of your grade depends on 3 required papers, which are graded by your TA, not the prof. My TA graded harshly, so I didn't have the best time. Lectures didn't hold my attention, but covered interesting concepts."

She is really sweet and actually cares about your grades which most teachers dont","Professor Ola is excellent, she is energetic and helped me learn quite a lot. Her tests and assignments are not always perfectly paired with the content of that week's/month's work but you will learn a lot. Very approachable and seems to truly care. I very much enjoyed her class.",Sometimes hard to understand. Very approachable.,sometimes a little hard to understand. overall was an easy class with a good teacher. easy class if you come to class regularly and are interested in learning the language,,"This woman is a horrible person; she is rude, insensitive and completely disrespectful to all students.

Complicated assignments for a required class, tries to make BTW relevant, not just a mandatory course.","Very subjective grading style and a very laid back attitude with dates and record keeping. He is nice and kind of grades on effort so he will give you a B-/C+ for effort. Giving A's depends on his mood. Don't waste time thinking why you got a B+ on a project, there is no logic behind it. You could not try and get an A on the next project.","He's a reasonable professor, but if you want an A, you'll have to put in the work and remind him of all 6 assignments for grades. Other than that, he's ready to offer good advice and useful lessons, especially during office hours.","He is very disorganized, and he does not stick to the syllabus that is given at the beginning of the semester. Often times it is unclear when an assignment is due. Grading also takes a very long time. We did not receive any assignments until about week 10 into the semester. He gives helpful advice but it is VERY difficult to contact him even email","He has no rubric for his grading, so you'll just be given a grade depending on how he's feeling at that moment. He grades his hw assignments with checks and check pluses. He gave one of my projects  a ""B/B+"" (what the hell does that mean). It's the end of the semester and he still doesn't have any grades in.","Andrew is a great guy. To say he is super laid back is an understatement. I'm pretty sure people turned in assignments late all semester. BTW263 was an international writing course, it is different than BTW250. Andrew goes out of his way to be nice to his students, basically any comment anyone made in class was the right answer, which is good &amp; bad","Andrew is a very laid back teacher.  His instructions for assignments are very open ended.  He does take a while to grade assignments.  However, he extends deadlines all the time, so you have plenty of time to write your papers.  He gives extra credit once or twice.  Great professor! He's always available to give you feedback on your assignments.","While of course you will be writing a lot of papers which isn't much fun, Andrew will go out of his way to help you write them and improve your writing, and he tries to make class interesting. He also allows all of the papers to be written in groups, so try to make a buddy or two. I would definitely recommend him for Rhet.","Tended to get really sidetracked with grading and discussions to stay within a reasonable time period. We had decently interesting class discussions, lots of weekly written ""notebook"" assignments, 4 formal essays. I liked that he did give a chance to make a revision on the graded initial submission to get credit that was greater than the 1st try.","He is an easy grader. But his lectures are so convoluted, disorganized and confusing. He may be interesting to listen to in other classes but not in intro to American literature. He is also so slow at grading. He is uncomfortable to talk to one on one. Would not recommend engl 116 with him if you want to truly learn/improve your writing.",Andrew is a good guy and keeps the class interesting. Take rhet with him.,"Andrew was a great teacher, he was very good about discussing papers before they were due and after they were graded. However, he did take a long time to grade papers and tests, we ended up skipping some papers because he was so backed up. He encourages you to think for yourself and make the most of your education. That is why we are here anyways!","Andrew was a great teacher. He made rhetoric very fun. Also his workload wasnt as heavy as what ive heard of other professors. He also makes class fun and interesting, very involved. Definitely recommend him for Rhet",Professor Moss was awesome.  He was super helpful and really funny.  His grading is pretty easy.  I highly recommend trying to get him for Rhetoric,Don't take BTW 250 with Andrew if you want to learn how to write resumes/cover letters. He teaches actual business writing. You'll spend the entire semesters on memos and letters. Definitely go to his office hours and have him look over your drafts. He will let you know what to fix. He is quite helpful. I felt his course was very beneficial.,"WONDERFUL TA! made an extreme effort to explain everything, had fun and relevant ways of helping you relate to material, excellent at helping his students review. would definitely take any other class he was teaching/TAing!","so much fun in class, very accessible TA. wants everyone to learn the material and get good grades, but doesn't want that to  be a boring and painful time.","He's a good english teacher and is pretty lax on grades.

I would 100% take one of her courses again!,"If you decide to take this class, don't, unless you really like grammar and sentences. There are easier 300 level classes. Cristina is a great teacher, but the material for this class is really hard and you basically have to teach yourself. Good luck if you decide to stick with the class.","I love Profe.

As long as you take thorough notes, attend EVERY class and study, you will do well! He is very helpful too","Very excited about exercise &amp; health psych material.  Enthusiastic, wants people to be there and to learn.  Hands notes out in class.  Understanding if you're sick.  Tests right off of lectures/notes, not too much work to get an A.  Scary dude if you don't like to talk in class though. He's not into unresponsive people.","Condescending, pointless memorization. Really made me hate a subject I thought I'd be really excited about. I'm all about research but memorizing meticulous details of 50 studies is not my idea of learning",Dr Motl was mildly entertaining at times but we were demanded to memorize pointless studies verbatim and spit them out on ridiculous essays in detail. I went into that class with a great attitude and very excited about exercise psychology. He likes to belittle people occasionally and calls people out. He was quite condescending at times,awful class. Exams consist of memorizing pointless data from studies. He wants very specific answers.

His notes are VERY good (I'm keeping my printouts), except for the section on his research topic (too in-depth for an intro survey class). HW problems are excellent, but office hours are few and crowded and solutions unavailable.  Lectures were pretty good; I really appreciate the attitude towards physics that he teaches.","The lectures are scrawled in blue sharpie on an archaic light bulb projector (no CTRL-f). The prof admitted that his notes are incomplete and advises you to read or watch something else to learn the material. His accent is terrible and he speaks about half as fast as the average person. His HW requires calculators, but you cannot use one the exams.","Professor Mouschovias is really nice and tries to be helpful and will go the extra mile for his students, but I'm not going to lie, this class is HARD, especially the second half.  A good TA is a must.  I think some of the stuff he teaches is definitely above the 200 level.","Prof. Mouschovais is a silent killer who always wears a smile and ""tries to help"".

At the beginning of the year she even started lectures out talking slowly so we could understand her accent which was incredibly helpful. Great class but there is a lot of material to memorize and a few papers to do.,"Dr. Mudar has a lot of insight on her topics. She goes over a lot in class so don't try to take notes on every single slide because she does post them on Compass afterwards.

Muncaster's explanations can be very confusing and you find yourself looking for other resources often (""Watch it"" on Webassign is very helpful). Exams get curved to a 80% at the very end, so it makes up for the averages being 67%.","Not very great teacher. He goes through the material very quickly. The exams are harder than I expected, specially multiple choice. In general, not the best calc class I've taken.","His lectures took a ton of material straight from the book.  For the most part every single topic felt disconnected, and so the class seemed like it was teaching way more content than was actually present.  Also, his enunciation was generally fairly poor.  He could have been way worse, but there are definitely better professors to help you learn.","Great professor, he explains concepts well during lectures. Has a lot of office hours, and he is very helpful if you go to them. However, the tests for this semester of Calc 3 were much more difficult than the previous years, so be prepared to study","An excellent professor for bright students. He moves quickly during lecture, but also consistently grounds the methods that you're learning in actual application. He's animated during lecture and is always willing to entertain an interesting question brought to him after class. For an average student, he likely spends too few words per topic.","Muncaster takes students through every book chapter, providing at least 3 examples for every new concept. However, he doesn't stop for questions in class, is hard to reach at office hours, and doesn't reply to emails. The best time to get to him would be immediately after lecture, where he answers any questions with clear explanations.","This class Is really tough. However if you apply yourself, go to lecture and tutoring an A is possible. Dr. Bob is not clear when teaching, moves really fast and doesn't really sympathize with students. Lectures are not mandatory, but if you want to succeed I wouldn't advise skipping.","Lectures were okay, but the tests were outrageously difficult. The book is respected in the field of linear algebra, but is completely without practice problems, making practicing and reinforcing concepts very difficult. Wan't helpful during office hours - had to schedule 20 minute sessions through his secretary. Ridiculous.",I think he's a great professor who made the lectures simple and easy to understand. Each homework only consists of 5 questions. Pretty easy to get full score on every homework if going to the tutoring hour for checking. 3 midterms are getting easier and easier. Good choice.,"I don't know why everyone on here thinks Dr. Bob is such a terrible teacher. I'm in the class right now with a high A after the first exam, and I've gotten a 100% on every homework assignment. If you go to lecture, pay attention, and take notes, you'll be fine. He explains everything thoroughly &amp; exams are exactly like the problems we do in class.",Ok teacher. Strictly followed the textbook. Very strict grader.,"When the class started, I was certain he was just another professor who couldn't teach to the level of the students. I was wrong, he may teach as though his audience is a group of post-docs, but his level of understanding is extremely helpful if you take the time to ask him questions to simplify a topic. He is also a very easy-going person.","Dr. Bob who knows his stuff. He answers any questions asked in class thoroughly, even when he knows the person asking hasn't been paying attention for the whole period. Math 125 IS a hard course, but Dr. Bob definitely knows his material and tries to be helpful and fair to his students.","math 125 is a complete waste of time. muncaster hardly teaches anything and you struggle to understand almost everything because he doesn't expand or explain anything he just ""expects you to know what he knows"" avoid this class if you can. don't need to buy the book or notes, i never used them. bad teacher. bad class","After two weeks I stopped going to class and teach myself from the book. Buying the notes is beyond pointless because a complete set is on the website. He makes everything seem overly complicated.  Granted it takes a little longer to learn by myself through the book, it is laid out in plain English without unnecessary symbols or signs Bob adds.",Don't buy his course notes. 80%+ of the content covered in the notes isn't printed in them. It's essentially a pricy notebook. Every page is one-sided for the benefit of right-handed people. Sucks a lot for lefties. Can't pay attention to what he says because I'm constantly struggling to copy down the notes. Have had to teach myself with Youtube.

Had open book midterms and pop quizzes (no finals). The pop quizzes were the only challenging part of the course but only because they were timed. Her clarity is 4 only because she has a slight accent.

Essays were very doable, pop quizzes in discussion were annoying but manageable if you do the reading--which there is a lot of.  I tanked on the midterm but pulled off a B in the class by studying the key terms and quotes she went over in lecture.","Professor Murison is a WONDERFUL professor! She is so passionate about literature, and makes herself available to help students if you need it. I loved this class and recommend it!",Had her for an honors seminar. Struck a great balance between Prof. insight and class participation.

I'm a really hardworking student, but he is absolutely ridiculous. His tests focus on really difficult concepts and the lectures are incredibly boring. I worked my butt off in this stupid class and it destroyed me. I would never recommend this class or professor to anyone.","These lectures are just him going through presidential speeches and different rhetorical elements used in the speeches. Very boring lecture, but attendance is taken for a grade. Tests are only 30 questions so it's very easy to do poorly especially because they are very challenging. Your grade is based on attendance, 3 exams, and 2 papers.",CMN 321 by Murphy is the worst communication class Ive taken. This class is very pointless (you dont actually learn about persuasion skills) and by the end of the class you dont learn anything valuable from it.,"3 tests (25 questions each), two papers. Thats it.  Rather boring lectures.  I would not classify this as a communication class.  As others have stated, there is more emphasis on the history.  Very misleading class title.  Ten points off for each class missed/late 10 min.  I would personally not recommend to a friend.",Don't take unless you're interested in taking a history course. Not sure I learned one thing in this class. Grades so tough on papers and tests suck. Worth 100 points but only 25 questions? Setting you up to fail. Don't take this course.,Only 2 papers and 3 tests. Very tough grader on the papers and the tests are 100 points and only 25 questions meaning if you get a few wrong your grade drops drastically. Lectures are long and very boring.  He mispronounces words and his voice is incredibly annoying. Definitely would not recommend this class.,"Wish I could take this class again. Murphy is awesome and there's no homework besides two papers (two pages each). Don't need to do the readings and if you take good notes during lecture, tests (there are three) are a breeze. Honestly just a great class and very interesting - take it","This class is made for history majors, yet is labeled a strategies of persuasion course. This class should be called The History of Presidential Speeches. Overall, the course is very misleading and there are barely any point opportunities. You need to go to class yet do not receive credit for going.. He essentially does not care about students. GL","I would recommend that you don't take this course. The tests are difficult and only 25 questions, meaning if you miss only a few your chance of getting an A is out the window.

HOWEVER, he is a tough grader on papers and attendance is ABSOLUTELY MANDATORY. Good. Luck.. Chuck.","Easily my favorite class I've taken and easily the best lecturer I've had at UIUC. The lectures are engaging, fun, and he makes things very clear. 3 tests and 2 papers are the only grades in the class, but if you go to class, you won't have an issue with them.

Would take this class again,"It was supposed to be a class about persuasion theories, but it could have doubled as a US president  history class. If you don't like history, absolutely do not take.

There is no better professor in communication at UIUC.,"Murphy is an old school guy, teaches with an overhead instead of a powerpoint.  His exams come from everything he says in class, nearly word for word.  Very easy class.",I liked the class. The TA Katie Irwin is also awesome. Make attendance a priority and take detailed notes. Your hand might hurt from writing so much by the end of it but in the end you learn a lot from a really smart guy who is internationally known for his rhetoric research yet he still is pretty humble and nice to us :) also he tells good jokes,"Energetic, easy to follow. He tests on his lectures in class, so just take good notes. Tests are not hard and he is interesting to listen to, does great Bill Clinton impressions. Smart guy","his classes are very entertaining. He is a very fun teacher to be with. If you are a fast note taker, it is a very easy class because he gives out tests and essays based on what he says in class.

Ditch lecture, use YouTube.","While Professor Murphy may be incredibly smart, that does not define him as a professor. The grading in the class is 80% tests, 20% quizzes.

The course is aimed at Engineering and Math majors which implies that it is tough to begin with. The homework is very tedious and is not nearly as hard as the quiz and test questions. Best way to prepare for those are by looking at his old tests and quizzes. Class is hard to even pass.,"Professor Murphy is great.

The tests are much harder than hw and quizzes, also he didn't adjust for the strike at all which screwed me","Hardest math class I've ever taken. His lectures are not bad by any means, but the only way to prepare for his quizzes and tests is by looking at examples from his previous MATH 220 and 221 classes. Homework completely misses the point compared to tests.

He consistently recommends that you complete the homework (that you often have to learn on your own) just to be faced with test questions that are exponentially more difficult. Further, he is clearly oblivious to when students are struggling.","I guess the best part about Prof. Murphy is that he gives you all the resources you need to excel in his class on the course webpage.

I really learned a lot from the class. 2 five-page papers, a hand full of response papers, 2 exams, and a group presentation. My only complaint was that her essay grading was largely influenced by her preferences for style, not necessarily content/quality of the essay.","Professor Nazar is excellent. She is extremely knowledgeable on her subject, and skilled in communicating that knowledge.

She's really helpful with editing papers SO ASK HER!!! Otherwise she was very nice!,"At first, she was very funny and seemed to find an interesting way to present the material.  But as the term went on, she seemed less interested and more annoyed with the class.  We had very few grades, and she grades papers harshly, so you really have to work hard on those grades.  Overall, not bad, but not a great professor.","Nazar was nice and the class was okay. She did take suggestions, but the problem is that it sometimes made it hard to know what SHE (really) wanted. I can see why some people consider her unfair, as her directions were not always clear and it felt sometimes like she was making up rules as she went along. Not terrible, but not ""great"" either.","Professor Nazar is really nice and helpful. She is really open to taking suggestions from the students.

One of the best teachers in atmos department!,"There is a lot of material in this course, but Steve is always willing to answer questions in class.  The lectures might be better split up into shorter periods, tough with an 80 minute lecture period.  There was a lot of good discussion in class that was unique compared with other atmos undergrad courses.","Don't take any course with him if you want your assignments graded. He didn't even make the faculty deadline for reporting grades, and some of us are applying to grad school so it's putting that on hold. Two exams non-cumulative, homework here and there, one presentation. He didn't grade any of it so who cares how anyone did. Super unorganized.","Prepare yourself for judicious use of the word ""basically."""

I always looked forward to going to her class and I really feel like I learned a lot from it. She is a really lenient grader because her main priority is that her students learn. She even got pizza for us on the day of the final!,"Dr. Nesbitt is honestly one of the best professors I've ever had at UIUC, and I rarely say that about any professor. She genuinely cares for every one of her students and deeply wants them to learn interesting concepts. The course starts off with readings in certain short books and there are two major project presentations. Overall, amazing class.",Anna cares about her students and tries to help you if you need it. Her lectures are boring and she's kind of quiet. But she's alright.,The class was very unstructured. No notes. Make your own notes. Professor was nice in terms of curving. But midterm questions can come from anywhere. Tests are online and you can use Google.,"Dr. Nesbitt is one of the best professors at this university. She knows her subject well, cares deeply about students, and is very approachable and friendly. She is flexible with deadlines and focuses more on students' learning. I would highly recommend any of her classes.","challenging material, but cares about students.  provides lots of opportunities to succeed.",ESE 497 was one of the best courses I have taken. Both Anna and Rob made our trip to Costa Rica really enjoyable. I could tell they really care about us as students by going the extra mile to make the course more affordable and letting us explore our own interests in the class.,"Not sure what the reviewer claiming that Dr. Nesbitt was unclear means.  Dr. Nesbitt was quite clear about her expectations with assignments and even provided rubrics for everything.  She did once change an assignment due date, because the majority of the class requested the change.  The trip was amazing and life changing!","Went to Costa Rica as study abroad. She was unclear &amp; vague with ALL assignments, &amp; even changed what she wanted after deadlines already passed! Her expectations were ridiculous for the work she asked. Although she let us redo everything it was a waste of time b/c the assignment would be changed after turning it in. Not even worth the trip to me."

You can tell he really cares about the material he is teaching and the students he is lecturing to.,"Easily the best teacher I have had at UIUC. His exams can be difficult because they are all essay-based. However, he is very kind and understanding. More importantly, you'll actually look forward to going to class everyday. He has a passion for teaching and it shows. He's also very helpful in explaining topics that are difficult to understand.","Best professor I've had at the UofI.  It's obvious he loves the subject and the majority of the class is based on open discussions over readings. He makes you think more critically and analytically about the inner/outer workings of business. Exams are essay-based but as long as you go to lectures and participate in discussion, they're not tough.","One of the best professors I have had. He is intelligent and always well prepared. His grasp of business administration is high, but what stood out in the seminar was his ability to teach, to engage, and to allow the students to lead the class (BADM 510 is a seminar).","Professor Neuman is a very knowledgeable and experienced teacher. I came into the organizational management class not really caring about the topic, but his style of teaching is very involving and interesting.

Not easy but put in the effort and you'll ""master the material"" :)",One of the best professors I've ever had! He was always energetic during class and was always available to help after class. He also always replied to emails quickly and made the class easy.,Nevins was really enthusiastic about the material and really wanted everyone to do well. Sometimes he went a little fast though but it helps if you read the textbook before lecture.,"Nevins is a great guy! It was very tough for me to follow his lectures because he goes VERY quickly, and spends a bit too much time doing unnecessary proofs. If you just tune out for those, it's fine. VERY fair course..he drops like 5 quizzes and homeworks, each, and I never had a problem with grading. It's an extremely fair class with Nevins","A cute professor but not an easy course. Well, it should be easy but I'm not quite a math person. Anyway, this is a good professor.","You should definitely take his class! He's enthusiastic about everything math, calculus particularly. You won't often see a guy as energetic and loving math as he is. Highly recommended.","Nice guy!!!He is soooo passionate,and he explains the material very clearly","Great professor. Definitely take the course with him. He absolutely loves the material and even tells you so 27 million times. Now that the semester is over, I wish I had gone for more of his lectures. Not for this explanations but rather his enthusiasm. The course isn't too hard if you do the WebAssign and exams from previous semesters.","Professor Nevins is awesome!  His classes are pretty hard, but that's because he requires you do what is necessary to get the best grade possible.  Many people complain because they don't want to do the work, and they are mad that Nevins requires that they do so much, but that is what it takes to master his material.  Deal with it.","Great teacher.  He obviously loves the material and verbally tells you so.  While he may talk fast sometimes, you can get used to it.  Calc 3 is a challenging class, but Nevins makes it as easy as possible.","Great professor, the only one in my semester that actually tried to be funny. He made class entertaining and actually fun sometimes. He teaches about as good as anyone can in a 50 minute lecture.",aweful teacher!  never take him.  you have to teach yourself everything cuz he's is such a bad lecturer.,"Prof. Nevins was a great professor. He is very excited about teaching and keeps the audiences interest during lectures. As long as you do the web assign, you should be more than prepared for all of his exams.","He's a funny guy, knows the material very well. Prepare for the exams to be very difficult, but you feel great after the curve. A great class to take. If you want a good grade, do what he says and ""Master the material.""","Prof Nevins is friendly, motivated and passionate about math.  I would recommend doing his suggested reading prior to attending his lectures, or obtaining some idea of the material, otherwise you'll get a bit lost.  After every midterm you will think that you got an F, if you are human.  But, due to generous grading &amp; curves it may me a B or A.","I like math, and I must say that his class is very, very difficult. He goes too fast  in the lectures, so fast that you do not understand anything. Lectures become a waste, and you have to study everything yourself.So what is the point of the class if you study yourself? It was a big disappointment, his teaching strategy is very poor.Avoid his clas","Great guy. Funny. Teaching style is not for me though. He spends too much time writing on the board which makes him talk incredibly fast to cover everything, so it only made sense if I had already understood the theory prior to lecture. Exams are relatively easy.",An energetic teacher but lectures are not helpful whatsoever and you basically end up having to teach the material to yourself in order to make a good grade.,Never  EVER take him!! i got an A+ in this class because i studied a lot on my own .

She isn't a traditional kind of teacher, but if you listen to what she says you'll find that she is so so so intelligent and truly does care about her students. A WONDERFUL teacher. Our class felt more like a group of us hanging out and discussing Shakespeare/the real world than it did an actual honors seminar. Amazing woman",For an example of her teaching: she went over every scene in the first few acts of a play we read except one which she skipped over in order to argue that one character in the play wasn't a bad guy. In the scene she skipped said character attempts to convince another character to murder people with him and discusses how bad he has been in the past.,"If your major or minor is English and you're used to relatively structured, organized, and informative classes, don't take this class. Dr. Newcomb is a nice person, but I learned virtually nothing about Shakespeare in this class, and we only read a handful of plays. Most of the time in class is spent reading aloud, and you don't learn much.",I've taken five classes so far in my studies that have covered Shakespeare and she has been the worst Shakespeare professor of the five. Her knowledge on the plays is extremely limited. She only teaches her opinion and will not listen to the possibility of another way to interpret a section of the text. I cannot recommend this class at all.,"I'm not an English major (had to take this class for other requirements). This was the first English class I took in over 2 years and she made is so enjoyable. If you meet with her to review your paper ideas, you'll easily get an A. She's so sweet and really cares about you. Great lady.","Very intelligent woman, definitely knows her stuff about everything she covers in the survey course. She's enthusiastic and enjoys teaching. Her readings are not overwhelming in length compared to other surveys. But they are early English works, so they are naturally a bit tough. This will not be impossible to pass, but it also won't be an easy A.","She provided slide after slide of slightly disorganized historical context, and then attempted (and failed) to connect it to the actual texts we read. The specificity of her tests was unfair, as she would test vocab she never fully defined in class. She would tell you to memorize publication dates of twenty texts with only one ending up on the test",Sweet,"Prof Newcomb brings an energetic attitude to class and is very willing to help students understand the more complex language and plots in Shakespeare's plays. A little wacky, but overall a great professor. If I didn't hate Shakespeare with an undying passion I would definitely take more of her courses.","My third class with Prof. Newcomb, I used to dislike her but now I get her.She NEVER hands anything back and you won't get a grade till you're final one, but if you participate alot and keep up on the reading you should be okay in the end or maybe not as the class smarties got B's.Shes really loopy and we have a theory that she comes to class ****",I had Prof. Newcomb for an English 199 Shakespeare James Scholar course. She is an amazing professor who truly cares about students' interpretations about the text. She is very approachable and always willing to make extra time for her students. Can't wait to take more English courses with her. If you ever get an opportunity to have her as a profes,"I have had her for four classes and loved every one more.  She is an astounding professor and draws interesting conclusions from overread material while simultaneously introducing underread texts.  I would take any class she offered, regardless of topic.",Very smart woman who went to Yale but seems like she wishes she could be teaching art class on paintings of Queen Elizabeth rather than literature.  -Nice but has some unique and weird teaching techniques.  Lectures were boring but sometimes she'd play movie clips to relate to the readings.  She would talk about paintings instead of test materials,"A little hard to take seriously due to her ""legally blonde""-esque approach to the field, but nevertheless a worthwhile professor and a good class. Knows how to make a lecture interesting, has unique (sometimes bizarre) insight into the material, and seems interested in student life. I think the snob thing is unfounded- she is blunt, but not aloof.","I think she's fabulous.  Engaging, good lecturer.  I heard Eng 209 was awful, but now with her it's one of my favorites.  She pics some good TAs form what I hear.  My TA is very cool.",A lot of material! Paper topics are complex which allows for flexibility.  Your T.A. makes the grade so cross your fingers.,No Comments,"This was her study abroad course, the people and material were awesome but she is a east coast wealthy snob who puts down any ideas except her own, she is very demaning and talks down to her own ta's","I really liked Professor Newcomb.  I still go and visit her in her office hours sometimes, and I had her last semester.  If you put the time and effort into the class, you will be rewarded.  If you approach her for help she'll be glad to help you.","i took a shakespeare class with prof. newcomb, and i loved her.  i often went to her office hours, and she was more than willing to help me.  she always had new, refreshing homework assignments and in-class activities."

If you have anxiety or are disturbed by movies with heavy topics, think twice before taking it.","I really enjoyed having this professor. He is clearly passionate about film, literature, and the arts in general. He has a great sense of humor, but he does not tolerate cellphone use/repeated tardiness in his class. He's pretty quirky, but an overall kind and efficient professor. We only had a handful of minor assignments and a few 4 page papers.",Coen brothers film class. He was very enthusiastic about the subject matter and fairly laid back and pleasant in contrast to the other reviews I'm seeing on here. He was more interested in having fruitful discussions than he was in being a punitive instructor or administering pop quizzes and lots of homework/readings. Flexible deadlines.,Yeah Professor Newcomb is definitely uppity and can be pretty mean at times. The prompts for his papers can be really convoluded and he's honestly only looking for a certain thesis an pretty specific supporting arguments. Overall there are multiple crude names that would be perfectly fitting for the dude.,"Spends weeks on one topic, repeating lectures and material but spends one quarter of one class session on topics that make him uncomfortable or he does not find interesting. He is uppity, has low expectations of students and is passive aggressive, manifesting his anger/disappointment in assignments and offhand comments.",Horrible class- boring and repetitive.  Room was always freezing cold and the movies weren't interesting at all except JFK.  Teacher wasn't really willing to help.  I wouldn't recommend this class or teacher.,"Great film class. Three papers, one final and attendance/participation. Not difficult since every other class was just a movie screening. Seems uppity at times, but just wants to see effort and participation in discussions.",Flaming ball of fire,"I was a bit bored.  He did not have a good questioning style that created class participation.  We mostly sat and stared at each other.  I even started asking questions (of the class) one day because I couldn't stand just sitting there.   The texts were interesting, just not the way he presented them.

There are 4 exams, only 3 highest are counted, and 2 easy assignments,...the exams contain literally everything from the notes, so study them in great DETAIL...easy going TA Keisha was very nice and helpful and always has a open door.

You can't find any studying materials on compass.","This was the hardest class I have ever taken. If you're considering this as an elective, don't do it. The course is pretty unorganized with some lectures, some purely class discussion, and readings that are SO HARD to understand even after talking them out in class. With that said, Ngo is one of the coolest, nicest teachers you can have at U of I.","If she were up for dating her students, I would jump on that boat so hard.","This class is the hardest I have ever taken. The readings are very difficult to understand, but Ngo is willing to explain it to you over and over again. You will be called on in class, and ""I didn't do the reading"" is not an option. However, Ngo's sense of humor and style and generosity with food makes coming to class prepared worth it.","Absolutely wonderful. Warning -- she does cold call students, but it honestly keeps you accountable because the material is extraordinarily dense. But she's hilarious, super intelligent, and a very genuine person who represents her most authentic self in and out of the classroom.","Love Professor Ngo!  Amazing class, super relevant material, and she's funny.  I learned a ton.","Wow, really smart and funny.

Easily one of the best professors I've ever had. She can be kinda confusing, but she makes class extremely enjoyable. She bought us pizza a couple times.","Awesome lecturer, very funny.  Material is difficult but worthwhile and revolutionary!  Highly recommend this class &amp;prof!","Very interesting class. Fiona was also very funny. At times she was a bit confusing, but going to discussion sections cleared everything up for me. Tests were very easy if you paid attention. She often gave study guides with everything you need to know. The only downside is reading material that had to be read before lecture.","She's a good teacher, very funny. Grade comes from 7 ""worksheets"" due throughout the semester that consist of answering questions extensively,a presentation, and participation. It's a small class so be prepared to be asked to speak in class because it is mostly discussion about readings and films watched in class.","Pretty boring class, though she's entertaining enough.  Assignments really sucked, but the material is more or less interesting, albeit irrelevant.","No exams, though a few pop quizzes. Lecture is hilarious but not necessarily mandatory. 3 large assignments with several parts. They are time consuming but not extremely difficult. One group project studying a space on campus.

She assigns a lot of dense reading (150 pages a week) but it's not necessarily dull and I got by several weeks not reading. Yes, she stutters but it's good because it gives you time to finish writing her sentence. She is extremely articulate and well-educated. Her job is to convey some abstract ideas, so the class could be tough.","She is brilliant and engaging, and her perspective and insights are much needed here.  I found her to be very generous and helpful.  She changed my way of thinking, and helped me think in a more nuanced way.","Mimi Nguyen is one of the BEST teachers I have EVER had. ive learned so much from her classes and i continue to think deeply about the themes. the fellow commenters here are out of hand, a blatant example of sexism and racism. dont take a class that requires attention, reading, and critical thought if you don't want that!","I'm surprised there are so many negative reviews for Mimi Nguyen. I thought her class was fascinating, and her passion for the subject was highly evident. This class isn't an easy A by any means, but the instructor is highly accessible and willing to clear up any misconceptions you may have.","Her lectures were really long and tedious, and it was difficult to follow along and take notes. She sometimes took weeks to post powerpoint slides, which makes it impossible to prepare for pop quizzes. Most of the readings were difficult, especially for a gen ed.  A lot of them had nothing to do with Asian American Pop Culture.

If I could describe this class in a few words, I would say: ""Hipster culture; Amateurish philosophy"".",Over complicates everything...sometimes the point she is trying to prove isnt even that deep.,"B-o-r-i-n-g. On a physical level, but more importantly, on an intellectual level. It's hard to explain until you personally sit through the vacuum of relevant or coherent ideas that ebbs between Nguyen and her loyal TAs who wait strafing in the corners. Also- Nguyen's lack of fluent speech skills becomes incredibly tiresome within a few lectures.","While she seems fun, bubbly &amp; young,her teaching is poor. Assigns hard readings (50+ pg per class) and said she didn't expect us to understand them. I don't doubt that she's well educated, but her comments so confusing and long that you lose what the point was in the 1st place. Utterly distracted by her lack of speaking skills.""uh uh uhhh"".","You get the vague sensation that Nguyen is talking down to everyone in the class. Ironically enough, she nevertheless lacks elementary teaching skills. Her counterculture/alternative tastes seep into almost everything she talks about... Regardless, an A is achievable if you have a brain in your head.",Readings are way too difficult and very irrelevant.  Lectures are boring.  Uses way too many big terms.  Over-complicates everything.  Expects too much.  I'd best avoid her class.,"So hard. Horrible speaker. Knows a lot about material, unable to relate to introductory level students. Did I mention horrible speaker? Grades are based on pop quizzes. Readings are ridiculously difficult unless you are already familiar with the material. She is not approachable. I am so glad this class is over and I would never take Nguyen's class","I didn't go to class toward the end because I would just fall asleep.  Lectures were utterly boring.  She needs to work on her speaking skills -desperately.-  She really does say ""um"" ""ya know"" or ""such as"" over 300 times in lecture.  I got bored one day in class (suprise) and made a tally sheet.","If you're interested in: 1) attend a long lecture that's sure to put you to sleep, 2)frusrate yourself with how much you hate this class and how mimi teaches, 3)go nuts on every pop quiz and essay you have to write, 4)have no clue what you're doing on the tests, and finally 5) ruin your gpa then this is the class for you.  find another class!!!","Don't take this class!! save your gpa!

Decent class over all but her lectures didn't hold my attention. My biggest gripe is that her tests are math heavy multiple choice tests, where the questions build off of each other. So if you can't answer one question you are kinda screwed. But she does drop two of the four tests.","She was not the best teacher, pretty confusing but her class was very easy. Make sure you study the homework, do the practice exams, and try to get your hands on the older practice exams for more help. You drop one exam and a chance to skip the final. take her class in the spring!"
961737,5.0,Lan,Nguyen Chaplin,3,0.5184614345183721,Lan Chaplin is a great Professor! She takes her time explaining what is expected of you and gives you all the resources and help you need. She is very passionate about what she teaches and it shows through her lectures. The midterm is not easy but you can easily get an A if you study all her lecture slides.

1480662,2.7,Amy,Nicely,14,0.33252359849804936,She pretty much repeats things directly from the book and has a difficult time making the material interesting but she did do a good job explaining everything and was willing to provide all the help you could need if you had questions. Do all the homework and come to class and you should be fine for the tests,"Unbelievably unhelpful in her teaching style. She made the class about sixteen times more boring than it needed to be. She also didnt write her own tests, so all of the quiz work didnt really prepare you for what you would face on the tests. A bad experience was had by all.","I studied for 46 hours for the final for her 102 class. I attended every office hour for my TA and for her. I got a D- on her final. I am a chemistry major and this majorly screwed up my grade. she did not teach at all. so boring in lecture, and the notes i wrote from her lecture slides were useless in studying.","iClicker points are the only reason to go to class at all as all of the lectures are online and she just reads them anyway. Tests are super hard, and quizzes are easy.",Boring class. You are required to attend lectures as there are points counted towards your final grade. Pick good TA.,"Honestly, she is a terrible professor. She reads off the slides. And her test are hard. She does not prepare you for them. And all her experiments fail. You better hope you have a good TA. I recommend Tanush for TA!","She reads the lecture slides word for word. She lectures as if she is talking to 12 year olds. Her tests are insanely hard. Test questions are often about one single insignificant topic mentioned once. Her tests are much, much harder than her lectuers make them out to be",Can't teach. The lecture slides are useful but she reads directly off of them so her lectures are pretty pointless.,She sucks.,"Nicely is very nice and she is good at answering specific questions, however she does not yet know how to lecture and I never learned anything or used any notes from lecture. Hopefully you have a good TA because if you don't (like me) your basically learning everything by yourself. And for god sakes by the past exams book.","She seems really nice, but it is notable that she is inexperienced. At the beginning of the semester, it was word for word off the lecture slides. Examples done in class definitely do not prepare you for the exams, but she is helpful in office hours. Discussion sections and T.A.s for this class are key to success.","She can't teach, but the course is easy and she's very helpful if you ask direct questions.","Compared to all of my other professors and teachers, she is probably one of the worst. She does not go into detail with explanations, and basically reads the slides. In addition to that she is incredibly monotone and boring to listen to, and the tests are way tougher than what she prepares you for. Luckily I took AP Chem, and the tests are curved.","I think she's new this year(Fall 2010). She tries and seems to care, but her exams are insanely hard and she's really boring to listen to. Also, like every class I've taken so far, the weekly quizes have nothing to do with what's on the test. However, I tend to learn a lot more from my T.A. than from Professor Nicely."

He's a good professor and the class is an easy A.,Prof. Niekerk is adorable and brilliant! Love his classes.,"Took his sex and literature class my freshman year. He is really funny and is really understanding about missing classes as long as you contact him before and don't make it a habit. Don't have to read the books to do well, just take notes in class and write down the main points he says and know how to elaborate on those. Interesting class, great gu","Great teacher, really knows his stuff, and his essays and tests aren't too difficult if you've been to class and know the major themes of each of the novels and can come up with references from the text.",This class is not an EASY A but it is a doable A... go to class everyday and take notes. you really do not have to even read the books you just have to remember what he says about the books and repeat it in your essays and the midterm/final. He is really funny and a nice guy so go to his office hours if you are struggling. I got an A in the end,"Prof. Niekerk is the greatest. I learned every day, and I wanted to read and prepare for him and for this wonderful class. So clear, loves what he does, and very cute.","I took this class as a freshman, and I really enjoyed it. Professor Niekerk has such a passion for the subject, and he's really knowledgeable too. He's pretty lenient on absences, but he'll definitely take points off if you miss more than he allows. Also, his accent is so cute.","This class was also a GWS 270 class. Awesome professor. Not difficult in this class, keeps the class interesting with unique reading selections. Very funny and helpful. Totally understanding if you have to miss class for something in your family even without an excuse form. Midterm and Final= easy if you read your novels",No Comments,Great guy and a good teacher. Keeps the discussion going in class. Ill miss him dearly,"Ger 199: He's a good man and a good teacher. The homework is almost daily with reading.

Best Math Professor ever.,"Prof Igor is a really nice guy. Although he gives lots of homework, he sets the mid terms really easy. His classes are more proof based which makes them slightly boring. He is very easy to talk to and willingly helps to clear your doubts. On the flip side, the course is rigorous, questions are asked on proving math theorems etc",He is so caring and almost perfect when giving lectures. Best math course I have ever taken!,"Definitely a hard course, but he makes it as simple as possible. His lecture is perfect and he posts well-written lecture notes online, so do not worry if you miss a class. If you have anything unclear about the course, go and ask him during office hours or through e-mail. He will answer everything clearly and thoroughly.",Professor Nikolaev likes to teach in depth of the materials. People usually don't get the point the first time. He makes the materials hard but reading notes helped a ton. Professor Nikolaev is super helpful outside of the classes. He basically wants you in all his office hours and he will do the homework for you. He curves so MUCH in tests/quizzes,"One of the hardest math classes but if you work hard, it pays off. Study from day 1 or else it's impossible to keep up. Work with a bright classmate on homeworks. Tips for scoring high: prepare for midterms really well, they are quite doable once you figure out the system. The final exam is a killer so dont leave it to the last to get a good grade.",This course is tough and you'd better be well-prepared. Make full use of the lecture notes because the textbook is useless for most of the time.,"This professor was amazing and felt like learning from my grandpa. Didn't know what he was saying half the time, but I learned math notation really well from him. Exams were weirdly hard and I always felt like I was on a different page than he was. All in all though, it wasn't bad because he'd solve the honors homework for you if you got stuck.",Not the most interesting material but he does a pretty solid job explaining concepts - some days better than others but overall not bad at explaining most of the proofs.  Extremely proof-heavy (expected) and errors in his online notes but not a difficult class.  Tests are easy-6 questions you choose 4 and he tells you 3 a week early (Thm proofs),"Took honors section of MATH 231, loved it, hard and super proof heavy but learned a ton. Always happy to help if you show up to office hours, really hard class, but super rewarding.","Great notes, made them available online after lecture. Strict on attendance. Homework out of the book was a bit difficult, but this was good practice for exams. Exams though, were quite difficult, grading techniques were pretty harsh. If you go to lecture, pay attention, do your homework, and study you'll do fine. If you dont, well...","Worst teacher ive had. Ever. Spends too much time proving theorems, neglects to teach how to apply them. Seems to assume you already know material. Office hours directly after class(middle of day)and on days after homework turn in and before you know enough to try the next. Always behind, takes attendance, so hard to go to other lectures to learn.","Lectures were dry--he would go through proofs of theorems with a few examples here and there for the entire time. His exams were great, though. Each was 6 problems, of which we had to do 4. Of these, 3 were hw problems and 3 were proofs taken from a list given to us to study from. Overall decent teacher for a challenging course.","Good notes, fair tests","Presentation of material isn't very clear, neglects to explain fundamentally important things.  He runs through everything on the board too fast.  It seems like he assumes that everyone already knows the material and expects everyone to instantly know whats going on with minimal explanation.  I wish I signed up for a different section.","Extremely useful, helpful I`ve ever had in this school. Teaches clearly with examples, puts every lecture notes on website. And interesting. Tests are not hard at all. Tells exactly what is gonna be on test. Little Russian accent, but understandable. Overall, great professor.","With all honesty, he is probably the easiest Math 241 teacher.  I don't know why all these people are giving him such poor grades.  Sure his Russian accent is a little thick, but I think he is a great teacher.  He goes a lot slower than the other Calc 3 teachers (often behind by 1 chapter), but that's only because he does so many examples in class","Wonderful professor: teaches very clearly. Generous grading scale and willing to give extra credit. Puts all lectures and homework solutions on internet. Extremely helpful during office hours: encourages questions and does not mind staying late. (Slight accent, but easy to understand.)","Good Professor, but definitely one of the harder 221 Sections(You will learn a lot). Test can be scary but he gives huge curves and with his grading scale a 56 is still passing. Comes from Russia so he has a bit of an accent but he is easy to understand. Makes really corny jokes.","Tests were difficult. The curve was not substantial. Homework and quiz grades only accounted for 25% of the total, and the rest was tests. I think that another teacher would probably be easier, but he is fair enough if you have to take a class with him."

She is one of the most entertaining professors I've ever had. She's very helpful in lab! You can tell how passionate she is about flowers!

People like to complain about the difficulty of his classes, but he really does emphasize the material you need to know for tests in class through discussion. Essays are tough and toughly graded.","Professor O'Brien has reasonably high expectations, but, if you pay attention in class, do the homework and study for the exams, you will get a lot out of the course.","He is a bit monotone during lectures. Copy fast, as he changes slides very quickly. For the tests, it REALLY helps to make a google doc of the study guide with several people in your discussion and keep sharing the link. Helped me so much on the final with 30+ people contributing. 3 papers total, grades somewhat tough. Not easy A.","It is impossible to stay awake. His voice is a boring monotone while the content is really disorganized; the lecture notes doesnt help much in the exam. The essay assignments are pointless in grading, overall I'd say dont take this class if you can.","One of the most intelligent and interesting professors I've ever had!  He's a little monotone, a little dense, but very interesting.","He's an overall good guy. Class is not easy, but not THAT hard either. Grades a little tough on papers (3 total in the class). Be prepared to write notes quickly because he loves to change the powerpoint slide too fast so it can be hard to keep up. Overall a good guy and a decent class.",hard to get A,No Comments

His class is easy too, just make sure not to skip the poem readings. Grade is based on attendance, so don't miss lecture.","O' Brien is a solid teacher. He's friendly, and he knows his stuff regarding Intro to Poetry. Sometimes a mumbler, its not really an issue because almost all of the class consists of analysis, so missing details doesn't hurt one at all.","He's so helpful and really knows how to teach. We discussed everything we had to read for homework &amp; in class. O'Brien lets you voice your opinions and responds to you as an adult university student, which is refreshing.

Philosophy in general is not simple and explaining it seems pretty impossible. I will admit that Derek expects a lot out of his students than we're prepared for considering it's a beginner's class.","Derek is boring, no doubt about it.  However, he's good at teaching the subject. People should avoid complaining about the reading, as he does not demand everyone does %100 of it, let alone understand %100.  For an intro class it is very informative.  I think most people take PHIL classes expecting an easy A, and that is a false assumption.",This guy doesn't know how to teach even if his life depended on it. He sits there and simply blabbers gibberish at you and has you do readings that he even admits are way too high for this class. Its an intro class and he clearly doesn't know that. Also he's very offensive and just plain idiotic. DO NOT take his class. I regret it every single day.

Don't buy the book, the e-book works fine and comes with the subscription for the online HW program.",A very easy Econ 302 class. The exams are graded fairly and quite straight forward. He is a little bit strange (distant) and  strict but he is a great professor-kept the material concise and on point.,"I took this class two years ago, and after having some other econ professors right now, i just thought it was worth going back to mention how helpful he was in comparison.  I learned a real lot and understood everything in what isn't very easy subject matter.  Definitely take ECON 302 with him.","He's great.

Her lectures may be boring, dull and hard to listen to, but the class is very doable as long as you keep up the reading, online quizzes and homework. There are many extra credit opportunities, so take advantage of those bc you learn a lot.","you have to like history to take this class.

I don't think people that don't like history will like her class. Her lectures are hard to follow and her voice gets monotone during the lectures sometimes.

He also had problems answering most questions that were brought up during class. Studying a tremendous amount (going over each assigned problem 4-5 times) does pay off on exams (A's and B's on them).

Regret taking his course, the proofs take a long time and they are graded harshly. The tests are fine if you study, the final is decent. He does not give curves but he is generous with partial credit on tests. I wish I did not take this course.","I got 5s on BC Calc, and felt prepared. I was sorely mistaken. Oikhberg is not a good lecturer, and though the class size is small for honors, he rarely takes time for questions.

Lectures were hard to follow, exams fairly difficult, too much arbitrary grading. Received a grade that ended in -9.96, and he refused to round. Thinks he's a big shot, really didn't enjoy his attitude toward students. Overall, makes life difficult for a gen ed course.",Professor Orta is fairly good at his job. Lectures are not listed as mandatory but for a good grade they are. I was more disappointed with his TA selection for discussion sections than anything else,Though lectures aren't mandatory you must go or else you will fail tests. Take notes verbatim from his slides and pay attention in discussion. The topic isn't too hard but he is very specific on tests!,"Orta's lectures are a must: try not to miss any, as the exams are heavily based on them and if you don't want to be cramming last minute to figure out all the material, just GO TO THE CLASS! His lectures are a little hard to follow because he kind of reads from his sheets but I have learned a lot from his class. 3 five page writing assts &amp; 2 exams.","This professor is terrible! The test are very hard. There are a few multiple choice (worth a lot of points), fill in the blank, and 2 essays which you have to do in 40 minutes because he hands out the test late. He is boring, old school, and confusing. He doesn't give out busy work, or any assignments for that matter. 3 test and a term paper.","I'm not sure what the other reviewers are talking about. His exams are super straightforward. He gives a ""word list"" prior to each exam, and if you know all the definitions, you'll get a 100%. Readings are all discussed in class, so you don't have to do them. Exams only require 5/6 questions to be answered per page, too, making them extra easy.",Professor Orta is a very old-school professor who relies on slides and lectures during his classes. There is a lot of reading but a lot of it is interesting so it is not hard to get through. He provides studyguides before every exam and there are only 3 exams.,"Do not take this class with this professor. He is absolutely terrible. You have 3 test and a term paper and that is it. He does not offer any extra credit and the test are very hard even if you study. He is a terrible teacher, he gives out no study guides and does not try to help his students pass the class.","Lots of readings, but if you go to class you can do well without them. Class is interesting, tests mainly focus on general themes. DO NOT take pictures of his slides.","Teaching style reminds me of a high school teacher. He knows a lot about his subject, but expects students to write down what's on his power point slides while listening to what he is saying. One of the most ineffective ways of presenting material. Just don't take this class with him. Choose another Anth103 prof. 103 is supposed to be really easy.","This guy doesn't want us to succeed in his class at all. Too many readings, doesn't go through all of them, useless slide outlines posted online (which are actually just the slides without the content and only the titles) and we can't even take pictures of his slides even though he talks much more than what's on the slides. Avoid him for this class","Terrible class. He is a bad lecturer and when you ask a question he never gives a direct answer, so you usually end up more confused than you were before. His tests are very hard and there's no good prep for it. Requires too many readings-3 books at once. I would avoid a class with him.","I never really go to class, and got As on the tests. Studying in needed and his tests are kind of weirdly structured.. Interesting class though.","I took prof. orta's anth 430 last spring. You will learn/read so many important authors in this class. Hes great for advice/consulting on papers. One word of advice though: the readings are really intense.. but if you can work through it, the class isnt over-bearingly hard. its heavily relient on discussion though.","I took Prof Orta's class last year and he is great. Sure, he may be ""dull."" but he is very smart and a great lecturer. Honestly, he is probably one of my favorite professors at this institution and deserves more recognition","I'm an Anth major and this class was by far the WORST Anth class I've ever taken in my 3 years here. Professor Orta is boring and his lectures are dull. Could not stand this class. Still got a B+ but it was a struggle since I just didn't care and he made it harder than it needed to be. Tests are hard, so study."

I finished this course and actually I have no idea what he was talking about. Every question he asked has a lot of answers. In the exams, he asked about definitions and silly stuff that you wouldn't expect. It was very boring class even though he's very nice.",Dr. Osman is an amazing professor. He is very enthusiastic about the material. The low workload makes the class more enjoyable for me because I'm able to focus more on learning rather than the actual grade. I would recommend this class to anyone!,By far my favorite class at uofi. I knew that I wanted to pursue a masters in economics but now I'm inspired to go after a PhD!,Dr. Osman is a great professor! It was his first time teaching and you can tell he loves the subject a lot. He's really nice and the workload is light which is refreshing since a lot of other classes just cause stress and you only focus on the grade. Here it was less pressure and I felt like I actually learned useful stuff.,"The material is very interesting and engaging, however Osman as a lecturer is fairly dry and boring. He is very knowledgeable and willing to help if you ask. Grading was inconsistent.  Was a blow off at first, by the end grading was much harder (Probably due to it being his first semester.) 2 homeworks, 1 presentation, 2 exams: LOW workload!"

She is great and the class had such great material and I learned so so much.,"Very easy class, especially if you've taken a GWS class before. The material is common sense. Ramona is unnecessarily strict, especially about phones, and she isn't great at leading discussion, but none of the work was hard. Attendance wasn't required or necessary to do well. Seeing others' final projects was the most interesting part of the class.",Great teacher! Very interesting class material. Students felt very comfortable in her class sharing personal stories because she makes it that way. Final project was very fun to do &amp; I learned a lot from other student's projects.

Also, she dropped our lowest exam and the final was very easy.  If you put in the time, there is absolutely no reason you should earn anything below an A.","Otnes is engaging and interesting in what could otherwise be a dry and boring class; examples and lectures are very relevant. Exams are easy, just review her slides and articles (and there are no more pop quizzes). Homework, however, is useless and not even included on exams, but you have to do it...Overall, a nice easy A.",I'm not a big fan of this class but it is mandatory. The material is BORING. Memorize the slides she post and what she tells you to read. You'll be good to go. I feel like even the TAs are not motivated.,"Well, her exams are not bad. You just have to study the slides and write down things she reiterate in class. I don't think she does a good job of making powerpoint slides...it is very disorganized. She only quiz you on stuff she thinks is important. Textbook is a rip off, you need it for homework and 1/5th of your studying.","She is really nice and her tests are very straight forward and not meant to trick you. I took the class last semester, there were pop quizes in class so attendance is mandatory. The online homework is very easy. If you skim through the book you'll get an A, if you don't then if you have a good amount of common sense you could probably pull off a B","She was on okay lady, kind of funny but a little annoying, freaked out way too much about cell phones.

Freaked about people who had cell phones in class, which is absolutely ridiculous.  Overall, a very easy class though","Her lectures were fun for the most part, and the tests were extremely easy, straight from the book. The pop quizzes were annoying, but the abundant extra credit points were enough to make up for point losses. It's an easy A.","Though the examples she use is interesting, the way she lectures just makes me fall asleep in class. Her tests are easy if you've read the book, though you can answer most of the questions with common sense. The grading for the article analysis is tough though. She makes us spend money to buy an account to do useless homework assignments.","Love this class! She really makes you understand the concepts and models through real world examples, which is really helpful.

No info posted online,no solution for homework,no respect to students, no interest in teaching,always not attending lectures. be careful!","Prof seemed to be ok, but TA and grader were VERY bad, and didn't want to be there.  TA was hostile, missed office hrs, accused me of starting homework 'at the last minute'-untrue. The grader NEVER replied to me and TA refused to switch to piazza while griping about how he'd already talked of a subject on the newsgroup (piazza fixes this problem)","Professor rambles through lecture slides he did not write, nor read, prior to lecture.  Clearly stated his dislike of the class, and does not deserve to teach if that is how he feels.  Disorganized, disrespectful, and has violated FERPA on at least one occasion.","Padua is a has-been expert in parallel computing, but he's not up to date with the latest technology.  This puts him at a disadvantage for teaching CS420 (parallel programming), because he can only explain Fortran 77 and array programming.  The lectures, exams, and machine problems are all completely unrelated.  Avoid this prof if you can!"
999373,4.0,Chetan,Pahlajani,1,0.4396925828831843,"If you have to take Math 234, you probably want to take it with chetan. Very clear, and if you do the hw you're set b/c ALL of the exam questions come from the book/quizzes. Doing the HW isn't mandatory, however if you want anything higher than a C, I HIGHLY recommend doing it."
124048,4.0,Robert,Pahre,27,0.5562360680847511,"I really like how the texts give us different perspectives about the issues. You really get to think about the issues rather than just regurgitate information. He is a really nice person and a good professor. However, this class was a lot of work for a 200 (quizzes were hard and took a long time) level class, so I probably would not take it again.","I was so nervous to have Pahre as a freshman, but he turned out to be my favorite professor my freshman year. You do have weekly reading quizzes but they aren't too difficult and no exams. He's such a humble and caring professor, it's really easy to talk to him about any confusion in the class or worries! Would totally have him again.","lectures jam packed with info, slides were pretty decent imo, very nice professor, good jokes sometimes. if u want a good A then u have to read the readings, if not u can kinda get by pretty easily, finessable","8 WEEK COURSE. 40 ONLINE QUIZES, 4 ESSAYS, LONG READINGS, FINAL EXAM IS BASED ON 2 ESSAYS AND 10 DEFINITION WITH EXPLANATIONS TO WHY IT IS MEANINGFUL AND GIVE EXAMPLES FROM SLIDES AND READINGS.",Pahre is a cool guy. His PowerPoints are only useful if you attend class to get the full details. It helps to do the weekly quizzes during class.,"This class was a new hybrid, it was supposed to tie several vocations together and did an okay job of it. Pahre was nice and helpful, Good professor.",This class had kind of difficult material but about what should be expected for a 400 level. He is a great professor with lots of experience and knowledge. I really enjoyed this class and got a lot out of it. Possibly the best professor I have had at UIUC,"Pahre is an awesome instructor! He really knows what he's talking about, and the course is fantastic. You'll learn a ton of cool stuff and can actually use some it in the future. He is pretty clear about explaining things and is always willing to answer question. Also, going to class is really helpful into turning this class into an easier grade.","Amazing guy who really knows his stuff. If you go to lectures, you'll ace the tests, as well as that he gives you extra credit for sitting in the front seat. Awesome topics, and really opens up your eyes to what's going on. Would do this 100000 times over, simply because of how great the class was.",Great guy. Interesting. AND a great beard.,Excellent instructor.,"Helpful, used examples.  Course material was interesting and updated.",He really knows a lot of stuff and he is extremelly well prepared in addition he IS funny with an unconventiobal sense of humor. Interesting class it is usefull to have economics background however I didn't and I did ok. Also helpful for real life,"He has a large participation grade, so you actually have to participate which sucks if you dont like waking up.Other than that the class was 3 papers and a final.I only read b4 the final and did fine.He had 3 papers, his grading is a bit ambiguous at first, you just have to figure it out after the first paper.Is boring if u have no interest in econ",Study Abroad with Prof. Pahre!!!!!!!! Had a great time and easy easy A!!!,He's great at lecturing. Decently entertaining.,"I hated this class, it was so hard to motivate myself to go at 8.30am.  The assignments were hard with very little explanation or guidelines.  The questions on the online quizzes were hard and obscure.  THIS CLASS IS NOT RECOMMENDED.",he took an easy class and made it hard for no reason. parhe thinks he is funny but hes not at all and half the time you feel like you are being talked down to. if you have somewhere else youd rather be at 8:30....like your BED...dont take his class.,"I had high expectations going into Pahre's International Relations class, and for the mostpart I'd say they were fulfilled.  We had no exams, just highly ambiguous writing assignments.  He's a really nice guy, but his class is tough... especially for 8:30AM.",You don't even have to go to class because he posts all the notes online.
997207,4.6,Ken,Paige,4,0.5595714201855012,Dr. Paige is a pro. He is a good example of what a University professor should be.,"Overall he does a good job explaining and you will understand the material. Tests are awkwardly skewed towards names, dates and obscure figures. Good class despite the fact that he does not seem to care that much","I had him for Evolutionary Ecology, and anyone in IB or NRES I would highly reccomend this course and this professor. He covers material that's not incomprehensible while not beneath a junior/senior in biological sciences, and in his 443 course you get to discuss studies every friday.",I would recommend this  professor to everyone.
