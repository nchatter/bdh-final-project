Make sure your grades on the discussions, quizzes, and Wiley are high enough because that's what is going to carry your grade. Don't be late on those or you will not pass the class.","Looking at ACCY 302 professors, I'm not sure I could recommend you take it with Drnevich. She does not give students any flexibility in anything! While the class allowed me to learn more about accounting, I feel I would have been better off with a different professor."

If you go to class, there isn?t a reason to not do well!",Overall effectiveness of teaching is good!,I took SPCM 199 from Kristin in Allen Hall and it was so much fun. She brought us candy and made us cookies. We got off topic quite a lot but we still got stuff done. Her stories can be hilarious.,"Hands down, my favorite class ever!  Kristin is great! The class was so much fun and I'd take it again if I could!","Very funny and cool. Every boy in the class is in love with her. She can be a tough grader, especially on preliminary outlines. Just follow the handbook as closely as possible to get the maximum grade, and PRACTICE. She does a good job of making the classroom environment a sociable and enjoyable one, however we often got off track."

HIs exams are mostly powerpoints but also throws in random material which is annoying. Id call it an easy class though as long as you memorize the powerpoints and take the quizzes",LOVE HIM! plays music before class which is great,He makes class exciting and interesting.,"I had this class for sports in society. It was an interesting course. Exams are easy if you study the slides and read the chapter. The chapters are very long though. Also you get all lecture quiz points if you take the lecture quiz. Total of 50. Show up to discussion and you should get all points for that to. Overall, a very good class."

Is passionate about computer science and librarianship, and is a great resource in and out of the classroom. Would definitely take another class by him.

She cares about all her students and even makes an effort to help them succeed in the development of their professional career. She has a wealth of knowledge when it comes to advertising and brings it to the classroom everyday.,"Brittany's lectures are very interesting, and she is more than willing to help you during office hours. There are weekly reading quizzes, but there are no exams. The semester-long group project is time-consuming but the most rewarding one I have completed in college. Brittany is also willing to give you career advice, so take advantage of that.","Brittany is a very smart and educated professional in the advertising field. She brings in a lot of her own knowledge and experiences to class. This class does have work, but not too much. In addition, Brittany is more than willing to help students with class work, life, resumes, finding jobs, etc.","No papers or exams, just one semester long project and a few assignments. Great teacher, very clear about assignments and wants you to succeed. loved her class. Reading quizzes were easy if you did the reading.",Worst class I've taken in my life. 200 level class made into like 400 level. Each point you lose is actually loosing 1 percent of your grade. Very scatter brained and you never know what was expected of you. Group projects are very very time consuming and difficult. Rubrics are very unclear. Thank god I'm done with this class!!
160949,3.0,Don,Dulany,9,0.5380211181443695,"took this class two years ago and dropped it because prof was boring and course packet with notes was so hard to follow. he knows the material but was not good at teaching it, was boring, and you could hardly hear him since he couldn't figure out how to use the mic. take 224 with federmeier, she puts notes online, is clear, and very nice.",If you are registered for Psych 460...you should drop it now....seriously.,"Totally agree with previous ratings- knows so much about what he's talking about that he forgets he's talking to a room full of upperclass undergrads and not one full of similarly-distinguished research psychologists.  The selected readings were really interesting, and help understanding A LOT- but bring coffee to class!",Dulany seems like he knows his stuff throughly but his ability to communicate to a class of undergraduates is limited at best. He seems to find a way to present simple material in the most complex fashion possible. He is better suited to lecture other professors or graduate students. Tests were 80% from his class lectures.,"If the reverse of ""those who can't do, teach"" is true then that explains A LOT.  Dulany knows what he's talking about -- he just can't teach it to save his life.  His notes are like English translated into Japanese and then back into English again.  Try and take this class with a different teacher.","The content is very easy, and the professor is very intelligent, but the format he uses to teach is horrible. Try and stay awake.","Great teacher, no quizes or HW, only tests. Hard to hear sometimes, classes kinda easy to fall asleep in.","One of the best teachers I've ever had, and his theatrical style keeps you attuned.",Great teacher!  VERY knowledgeable.

What we read about and discussed in class was really interesting, so it was easy to write the papers. We fell so behind that instead of having six papers to write we only wrote four. He's a bit of a tougher grader, but it helps you improve.","My favorite professor last semester. Walking in, I was like ""oh heck it's an old white guy time to serve him some tea"", but he was actually more woke than me so it was a pleasant surprise! Really cool guy if you get to know him. Passionate in his teachings, excellent and honest grader. Made me a better analytical writer! HIGHLY recommended!","I took his intro to poetry class and it was my favorite class among the 6 classes that I take for the semester. He is friendly, insightful, passionate about the stuff he talks about and engages people in his class. He makes writing papers such an enjoyable experiene! Wish I could take that course again if I could!! Easy exams if you attend class.","I learned a lot from being in this class, and I legitimately felt personally engaged in this class unlike most of the other ones that I took during my first semester here. His class isn't the easiest thing in the world, but challenges aren't always a bad thing. It's well worth the while in this case. I feel like I actually did *earn* my grade.",Dennis made me think in ways I never thought possible. He was definitely an inspirational teacher who understood how to properly keep students engaged in the conversations that were conducted in class. Definitely a great professor and a reliable personality.,"Dennis is very well may be the most intellectual professor I have yet too have. Took an intro to fiction class, ended up learning so much more than I expected! Go to class, read your stories, and do the very small amount of homework he assigns. Also go talk to him during office hours! Makes writing the two papers so much easier.","He is very tough grader on papers, very picky on students' writing. He did not expect you to improve. He seems like a strong Republicanism. He is very intellectual, but not so friendly to students. A lot readings in class. Attendance is necessary. Not a good English professor after all.",This man has been my favorite professor during my entire time at the University of Illinois. He's very insightful and made the poetry class I took with him even slightly philosophical. He values the students' personal takes on the works. Easy exams if you attend class.,"He is a very talkative guy I ever encounter in my life.Sometimes he talkes things outside the class such as news or political debates, but he also associated these things to the content of class. His voice is steel but not serious. He is very friendly and care about students. Read everything  and do everything he want on your paper in class.","Really helpful and the stories he chooses are usually easy reads. Some are a little less than awesome, including ""Heart of Darkness"" and ""Benito Cereno"", but most of them kept my attention and were enjoyable to read and discuss. Just do the weeklys and the questions and you should be all set.",I had Dullea for Intro to Poetry (way back in 1998) and he sponsored an independent study of Dorothy Parker my senior year.  He was by far my favorite professor (next to Kauffman).,Great teacher.  Take him if you're fulfilling the ADV COMP. Gen Ed ( and a double bonus because it covers the  literature and art requirement for LAS.)  He understands that his students aren't all English majors for this class so he is more forgiving with his expectations. So helpful and explains things well. Clear expectations. Take him!,"He is a great teacher, he is helpful but a little boring.  An overall very caring man.","HIS LECTURES ARE VERY BORING AND UNUSELESS, HES A GOOD RHET TEACHER BUT GRADES HARD ON PAPERS, U HAVE TO WRITE A WEEKLY THATS A PAGE LONG EVERY WEEK, HE MAKES U WANT TO FALL ASLEEP.

Teaches class out of order compared to other teachers so labs do not sync up but its not that big of a deal",Super nice guy and organized lecture notes . All you need really,"The lectures are good and the overall organization of the class is phenomenal (there's one course website that directs you to your homework, pre-maide textbook style notes, and lecture notes). However, the style of problems in lectures are not related to the homework, which are not related to tests. Thus its difficult to prepare for your exams.","Dullerud gives some of the most boring lectures I've ever attended. I had never fallen asleep in class before him. Felt like we jumped around on topics, sometimes we'd discuss the same simple topic for a week. Exams were totally off the wall, no way to prepare (sorry). Try to go above and beyond learning the concepts, and you could get an A.","His lectures were kind of boring, and, while he does post them online, his notes are very disorganized. The online homework system is terrible; it does help you learn at all, and rewards gaming the system for points.  I also didn't think the website was much help, and would have preferred a real textbook.",Dullerud's lectures are very clear but also slow and boring. The homework problems are the type that are difficult until you know how to solve it and are then quite simple. The website for this class is phenomenal and greatly improves the quality of the class.,"He made the course as easy as it should be. Go to lecture, do homework, and you will be fine. Exams could be a little tricky sometimes, but rechecking several times guarantees you a good grade.","He's a good professor, very thorough (if a bit slow in getting to the next subject) and the homework is helpful. No textbook, but his notes were enough. Watch out for ""range"" problems; he likes those.","Always prepared, sometimes overdid unimportant material/subjects and didn't get to more important ones.  Always willing to help/clarify/communicate and was respectful.  Recommended.  Tests were meh (kind of fair, kind of tricky, had a few bad questions), but I think it was compensated for by a curve at the end.  2 Hour midterms kind of suck.",not so helpful during the lectures...spends too much time talking about things that are not so important.,"worst teacher of ever, extremely arrogant",He is helpful and patient towards students and tends to explain concepts and goals well.  It is important to understand the concepts because he isn't going to tell you how to do every type of problem (which I don't think he should be doing anyway). He has his little phrases that make him a bit quirky.,"Very clear lectures. Extremely patient and helpful when you need it. Uses a tablet in class for notes and posts them all online. The homework is tough, hard to do it on your own. The tests were very hard as well. Nice guy too.",During lecture he provides only very simple examples to get the idea across. However  most of the time his homeworks would take so much time. The second half of the semester I was in office hours every week asking for help. And his tests were much more difficult than anything seen on the homework. But at the end he makes a huge curve.,"This Professor shows simple examples in class, but brings very different problems on each exam.  He does not understand the fact that the material is difficult.  His methods give you a false sense of security before taking his exams.  He does have a generous curve (75% get B A), but I think there are better ways to teach. Just do above the average.",This guy is the worst advisor ever. He was completely useless who had no idea what I needed as a freshman and no ability to answer the questions i had I was better off googling my major.  He had me out of there in 5 mins while my room mate got 45 with his advisor.  Note I have not had a class with him so i do not know his teaching skills.,arrogant,Excellent examples but unaware of our lacking in some topics.

Easily the best professor Ive had here so far",Professor Dunfield is the best math teacher I've ever had in my life. His office hours are very useful and he takes the time to ensure that you understand the topic if you seek the help.,"Amazing professor. So many resources (online lecture notes that he hand-wrote, worksheets and exam solutions, course diary, practice exams, pdf of your graded exam, office hours, etc etc) that can help you achieve the grade you want. Also, I really enjoyed his subtle humor.","Worksheets are harder than tests, but they are very good tool for me to get a big picture of new concepts. Practice exams are much like the real ones. The course is not easy, but u'll feel much easier if your professor is Nathan. The grading is fair. The overall grade will be curved. So dont worry. PS: Hes in suits every day! Like his beard : D","Calc 3 isn't the easiest class but Dunfield is exceptional at teaching its many concepts. The lectures are very informative and easy to understand, and exams themselves are very fair, and you get adequate preparation with many practice exams. Additionally, they are graded very fairly and quickly, and you get to see exactly where you went wrong.",Sometimes I think he is so talented and nice that he should teach sth much beyond Calc 3. If you can please take his class. He explains everything in lectures and hes very approachable outside class. He is patient and ready to every question. Hes also excellent at drawing 3D pictures to help you understand the geometry in calculus.,"Dunfield's lectures weren't boring, but sometimes they had no big picture and were confusing. He also sometimes went off topic and taught us things we didn't need for the test, which was annoying. Discussion worksheets were way harder than the tests. Tests were almost exactly like practice tests, so focus on studying from those. Fair grading.",Nathan Dunfield is amazing.,"Prof. Dunfield is by far one of the most talented professors I have had so far. He makes a effort to connect with students, especially in a large class like MATH 241. For example, I went to  his office hours once and he remembered my name. Additionally, his lectures are phenomenally clear and handles in class questions exceptionally well.","Dunfield is one of the smartest people I have ever met in my entire life. He is an amazing lecture and while he lectures quickly, they are clear (he is amazing at drawing the 3D shapes). His tests are very difficult, but the practice exams are great prep. I am not great at math but I managed to get through.",Professor Dunfield has very clear lectures and is always ready to answer any questions in a succinct manner. All of his drawings are incredible and make learning the concepts much more straightforward. Office hours can be quite helpful and he makes the effort to know you by name if you stop by and ask questions. Take this professor!!!!!,"He's so sweet! I took calc 3 as dual credit, didn't do so well, took it here with Nathan and he's a million times better than my prior instructor. Really helpful discussion worksheets and sends you a PDF of your exams so you can see your mistakes and how you are doing in calc 3.",An awesome professor who is always enthuastic in the lecture. The lectures are instructed clearly and organized well . He's extremely helpful and accessible to students. The notes are really helpful.,"Dunfield is probably one of the smartest math minds I've ever seen in my life. Because of that, at times it can be hard to keep up with his lectures and his way of explaining things can be more complex than it needs to be. However, he's a great artist so his visuals are super helpful.","Very good prof, clear and insightful. one of the best ive had during my time at Uni",Perfect sketching just make 3-D much easier,"Very good professor. Gives clear lectures and really cares about students. Though the course is tough, you will probably end up with good grades.","Awesome lecturer, very knowledgeable about the material (used to teach at CIT). But he sometimes goes too fast in lecture. Pretty helpful during office hours, HWs and exams are decent, not too hard not too easy. You will be able to do well if you put time in it.","Awesome professor. The class is a lot of work, but he provides you the resources to get the grade you want.  Regularly attending lecture and discussion, doing homework, and going to office hours/the Calc III tutor room will allow you to get the grade you want.","The class's discussion and homework tend to be difficult, but they aren't worth too much of your grade. They're where the problem solving learning takes place, and you should take them seriously, but not worry too much about grades so much as the learning and practice you get from them. Dunfield is a wiz when it comes to his drawings on the blackboards, and he explains the basic concepts very well. I never had any problems with him. He taught at Harvard and Caltech for awhile, so no surprises."
263675,4.5,Jason,Dunick,14,0.5332914944255943,"Jason is a decent teacher, his tests are mildly difficult because you really need to know your stuff to answer the questions, but he does give out study guides that are really helpful. His paper prompt are really ambiguous and he grades them very critically, so going to talk to him is something I recommend. He is also kinda full of himself...","I have now had Jason for two straight semesters. I really encourage you to take his class. He makes sure you know everything that will be on the test, but he is a fairly hard grader.","Even though he isn't officially a professor, he's better at teaching (and a harder grader) than any of the other profs I've had.  His class is super-straightforward: just read the book, memorize his list of terms perfectly, and then there's no way you can't do well.  He was often available to help and ate lunch with us to discuss current events.",excellent teacher who connects well with students,"Its true that he is not an easy grader, but in all fairness he does tell us exactly what is going to be on the tests. He gives a long list of terms that we need to memorize and several different essays. He picks two of them for the test. After all this, you can't really expect anything less that harsh grading.",I play football so my study time is limited.  This teacher goes out of his way to help student athletes succeed in the classroom. An A- in economics is better than beating Ohio State.,"Really nice guy, extremely helpful -- if you want to meet outside of class (I had him in Allen) he is more than willing to. However the class is based on very few grades and at any point there is little indication as to what your grade is. Easygoing, nice teacher but a tough grader sometimes :)","He's truely passionate about what he teaches which helps so much! To ace this class, just take good notes.","Fun teacher, but he grades REALLY hard, especially his tests.",Great Jokes.

And those suspenders are just awesome.","THIS GUY IS AWESOME!!!GOTTA LOVE THOSE SUSPENDERS AND THAT NEED FOR A TUPE.  When he walks, it looks like he's about to fart.  He is funny and great.

Eric is a great person but spends too much time on concepts and not on problem solving examples.","Tests got harder as the class progressed, but considering they were True/False I don't know how you could fail this class.  Dunn has your typically boring proffesor look and voice, but he is actually quite interesting.",This dude is a bad ass.  t/f tests with notes and example problems.  doesnt have wast time deriving everything just tells you what you need to know.  if you have a choice make sure to pick this guy.

However, if you're not a math/ science person like me, you should probably find another Nat Sci &amp; Quant. II class. Unless you plan weeks ahead, professor is ALWAYS busy. My TA is Cail Daley and he's the type of guy who know a lot but not how to explain. THE EXAMS ARE REALLY HARD even w/ a cheat sheet. Good luck :(",He's such an awesome teacher even if you're interested or not about astronomy you should definitely take his class it's not hard and very easy to get an A+. There needs to be more teachers like Professor Dunne that are very passionate about what they are teaching about!,"he is amazing!! if you attend the lectures and pay attention, you are sorted.",Lots of homework but they were spread out over the entire semester and were fairly easy so long as you show up and read the articles assigned.  There is no $100+ textbook to buy and the course material is fascinating.  Powerpoint presentations and NO TA section which is EXCELLENT.  Significant extra credit opportunity and lowest homework is dropped,Tests were so hard for a 100 level class-even with a cheat sheet. The homework was so long and boring. Do not take!! :(,"Took ASTR 150 as a non-astro major, really enjoyed it! First project was a little math-heavy for my taste but Prof. Dunne is extremely approachable and up for adapting to students' needs, so definitely chat with him if you have any questions or concerns! Lectures are awesome; he's a lot of fun to listen to. Two thumbs up.","He's very knowledgeable on the topics discussed and explains them well - doesn't just read off his power points. If you ask him a question, he almost always knows the answer off the top of his head. BONUS: HE LEAVES HIS SLIDES UP LONG ENOUGH FOR YOU TO TAKE NOTES AND NOT RUSH!!  Tests aren't easy but aren't impossible, and he allows a ""cheat sheet""",Very hilarious professor. Easy A class and reading doesn't matter too much.,"Online homework is easy. labs and exams are very hard, you are aloud a cheat sheet on the exam but no matter how much info you put on it the exams are still to difficult for a 100 level intro course","This was supposed to be an easy A gen ed but it was not easy. There was so much homework and the tests were really, really hard even with the cheat sheet you can use. Bryan is super nice but I just wish the exams were a little easier and that the lectures were shorter!","Pretty easy class. It doesn't require alot of understanding, but you need to be able to memorize, then A's are very possible for exams, just allow 1hr study per lecture (exams cover 7-8 lectures). Homework quizzes allow 3 attempts, so those are guaranteed 100%s. Not a hard class... getting an A but I don't feel I learned THAT much, to be honest",He talks down on you when you have a question or need clarification.  He can be very rude to students. His class is easy and what you need to know is straight forward.,"Very enthusiastic person, but teaching style is very confusing. The materials that are on the test is often not on the study guide, you basically have to remember every bit of the stuff he says in lecture.","His class was interesting, homework load was fair. discussions were easy. but when exams came, they were pretty hard. wish there were practice exams instead of TA reviewing the materials.",Weekly online homework answers can be found online. Lectures and activities were pretty interesting. You can tell he cares about the topic. Tests aren't the hardest and aren't the easiest.,"This class was pretty tough due to the exams. You did get a cheat sheet, but sometimes it was not helpful at all. You really need to know the concept. The lectures were quite long also.","I mean he's a nice guy and the weekly assignments/work load are not bad at all, but the exams are literally impossible. Cheat sheet doesn't help, and some of the questions I've never seen before in the lectures. He's not too bad but the exams are honestly HORRIBLE.","Very easy midterms and exam if you had done your homework and went to lectures (I studied less than 3 hours, 3 hours, 5 hours)  Lectures are enjoyable, and the professor gives off a great vibe. Easy classes, easy to follow.","Overall, it's an easy class. All the homework can be found online, and the labs are not too bad. He gives several extra credit opportunities, but his exams are extremely difficult. He lets you use a cheat sheet, but it doesn't help much.

Very hard and not recommended for anyone to take!!!!!!!!!!","Just finished this class this past spring. Great lecturer; I lucked out and had a good discussion section TA as well.

Basically, do the work, and you'll do well.","This class was horrible.  He did teach us anything other than what was in the book and never fully answered the questions.

Just read the textbook and you should be fine.","This guy is still one of my favorite Professors and I'm going into my third year.  All you have to do, as with any class, is show up, take notes, and study.  I didn't read a single page (minus the book on which the paper was based) and I aced every test and the paper.  He's a little dry but if you're even a little interested, you'll do fine.","Good lecturer in that he's slow and delibrate thus allowing good notes to be written, but some found him too boring.  Interest in the subject is helpful.  Gentle grader as best I can tell, but takes assignments seriously."

Since Math 417 is so abstract, without having read the textbook and practiced the assigned ""homework"" problems, you wouldn't really understand the material. His tests were relatively easy and his lectures &amp; notes were fairly comprehensive.","Dr. Dutta has a reputation for being hard to understand in his lectures. I did not find this to be true at all. He was clear and proofed everything he present in the course. His tests while difficult were fair. My favorite quote, ""COME ON, THIS IS 416 GUYS"". Overall great professor who cares about his students.",Completely condescending and rude to our class. I would not recommend anyone to take a class with him.,"He is the WORST professor I have ever come across. When students ask questions in class, he makes demeaning remarks about how you haven't done the homework or haven't been paying attention. When students don't ask questions, he gets mad and says that we should be asking questions because ""This is Math 416!"" Terribly unhelpful in office hours, too.",don't take the course,"Probably one of the worst professors I've ever had. If you can avoid taking a class with him, do so. He complains about the book not explaining the material well, but half of his lectures follow it exactly. He is of no help in office hours.","Above and beyond the worst professor I have ever had. He has this funny knack for claiming that the book is terrible, yet when you ask him a question, he responds by saying ""it's all in the book."" His lectures were boring and unhelpful, and he can be demeaning. You need to stay away from his guy's class. His class was my main cause of stress.","He has a heavy accent and a weak voice, so sit close to the front.  He does ask if there are questions frequently, but there rarely are because the material is so simple.  Seriously, it's a cakewalk.  He WILL give you a hard time if you ask stupid questions, because it'll obvious you've skipped many lectures you've lost track of what's happening.","If i were you, I wouldn't take his class. He needs to resign his position by none taking his section. He's that horrible. He's not making any sense in class but when I go to his office hour ask question, he says ""you don't know because you didn't show up in my class""","This professor is horrible, if you have a math class make sure not to choose him. He keeps asking the class ""Is it clear?"" ""Is it okay?"" but no one responds because everyone thinks its not okay. He makes everything super confusing and doesn't teach well at all. He is also usually the first one to leave after class, so its hard to ask questions.","Dutta is one of the least useful instructors I have ever had. His lectures made no sense, he would veer off into meaningless tangents and spend around 10% of the lecture telling us what was actually important. Thankfully his exams and quizzes were straightforward and easy. Take him, cram the exam reviews and you should get a B easily.","I think he's kind of funny, seems very personable.  I thought he was easy to understand, although he spent a lot of lecture time doing the abstract stuff, and then 10 minutes actually doing a problem, where you learned all you needed to know.  No homework required, quizzes and exams very easy.","Are you guys kidding me? Dutta is the worst teacher I've ever had. I mean, he actually threatened to kill everyone in the class! Dutta is a horrible human being, but I'll admit I've seen harder graders. You know what he gets? F+",He's probably not the best at explaining stuff...but he gives the easiest quizzes and exams. Math 415 is a class where you can get destroyed if you have a 'theory-freak' prof. He's not one of them.,One of the best lecturers at U of I.,"goes a bit quick and lectures are pretty much all theory; he spends VERY little time going over how to solve problems.  his tests are very simple, but he ""grades on the british system"", so if you get part 1 of a multi-part problem wrong, you are",he does have an accent but its not nearly as strong as MANY OTHERS in math and engineering. this guy teaches it so well that i suggest not buying a book if you have him and are willing to go to lectures. he has a great quiz policy where he drops 3. NO HW!,"You have to listen carefully to what he says, he has an accent.  And he has a catch phrase: isn't it?  He says it all the time, you'll find yourself saying it.  I never went to O.H. so I don't know if he's helpful, but didn't like the class very much."

Very clear and knowledgeable of material.,"Transferred in as a Junior, this Professor set the standard. Go to his office hours. Don't procrastinate, you will regret it. His classes are crystal clear and he will help you understand the material (after class of course). He enjoys teaching, and therefore you will enjoy learning. BTW he says 311 uses more math than 312.",Very knowledgeable in Compressible flow. Lectures with clarity and is very flexible. Tests are fair and straightforward. Really enjoyed coming to class.,"Great teacher. Very organized and knowledgeable in this area of compressible fluid dynamics. He carried out the important derivations which was helpful and gave great examples to understand the concepts. He also told a few jokes ever other lecture. Very friendly, easy going guy."

Very hard to follow, ending up trying to teach myself through the book.","He's really into theories and proofs. He is a great professor, though. He takes the time to make sure that you understand the material!",Great proffesor. He really takes the time to answer questions during lecture!,"He was probably the best of the calc 2 professors this semester, which really isn't saying much. The class is tough but doable if you study hard. His accent kind of makes it hard to understand him at times and he is also very soft spoken so sit in the front.","The tests are very hard and worth almost all the points. He also has a bit of an accent and talks quietly, so sit in the  front","Overall, I would say that this class was a Marathon, which I largely had to run on my own. If you go into office hours, he does displays a willingness to assist students. However, his lectures are often confusing, and mainly delve into general theory, rather than examples that may be presented on the exams. In short, decent guy, impossible teacher.","I would not recommend taking a math class with him. His tests are very difficult, he goes through difficult material quickly, and doesn't seem to care about his students. If you are able to, take it with a different professor. You aren't missing out on anything.","He's not the clearest for lectures, he could explain the subject matter a bit more.","never update my homework grade after I showed him 3 times and sent him 2 emails, and it accounts a lot for the final grade","Harder than other professors teaching the same course, but definitely worth it if you take math seriously. Very demanding on what you need to know for the tests, but puts in a concerted effort to make sure you understand even the most difficult concepts. Very clear lectures if you can get past the accent and Dutch phraseology.",This instructor is an idiot! He even did not give us a detailed syllabus for his class. He promised us to upload assignments at a certain date but failed to do that many times. What he taught was too ambiguous. Honestly I highly don't recommend students to take his classes.,"I couldn't understand the book, but I understood him pretty well. Places HUGE emphasis on exams, and not so much on HW and quizzes. But the exams are usually some variations of problems he's gone over in class at least once, so I recommend attending them.",Extremely smart guy but teaches everything from a pretty general perspective...extremely helpful and goes straight to the point which is an added advantage..highly recommend taking this guy's class,Does not curve.,"The guy teaches everything in the most general form possible, all with symbols and few examples that you're later tested on. He is hard to understand but it's evened out by the very low difficulty level of the course.",Try not to select his class if you can. You can learn more completely if you read the book then go to his class.,"He was very difficult and taught out of the book, but this math class is a bit difficult anyways, so it's hard to judge him.

He gave lots of partial credits because he cares more about whether you understand the problem or not than whether you get the right number. A good and funny guy.,Sergey is familiar with everything about PDE. The grading was also quite generous.,"Dyachenko is new to teaching. He did a good job answering questions though he needs to work on time management. Also the tests were simply too long for 50 mins. I would HIGHLY recommend asking him questions outside of class. I went to his office hours (often empty) and got lots of help. He is patient, helpful, and sure to improve in the future.","Sergey gives very interesting and detailed lectures with plenty of examples. At times the examples use more time and effort than they should, but overall one gets out what one puts in. Tests are hard, but he makes up for that by adding curves and/or bonus questions. My only complaint was the harsh homework grading, but that's the TA's fault.","Once I stopped coming to lectures and studying with a group of friends I stopped performing abysmally on the exams, which were very difficult and time-consuming for the 50 minutes we were allowed to finish them. As my friend said, you're better off just reading the book rather than listening to Dyachenko's confusing lectures.","25 year old post-doc, doesn't care about undergrads learning trivial things like DiffEq. Gives impossible questions on tests sometimes as a result of negligence. But makes up for it in the end. Class is laidback and relaxed, he jokes around often, even during tests. As for most math classes, lectures are useless, just read the book.",Homework doesn't line up with tests. Giant mathematical operations without calculators. No quizzes and just a few homework assignments to practice. Brutal exams with material unlike the lectures. Provides very few examples - most of his lectures consisted of proofs. Very inexperienced professor who makes many mistakes.,"He is a very inexperienced professor and his lectures are filled with too many proofs and MISTAKES!! The material isn't that difficult, but the tests are absolutely brutal! He definitely is trying to improve his teaching by taking advice from his students but still doesn't make up for the fact that his HW/ lectures do not prepare us for his tests",His test will crush you if you are unprepared. Take his class and challenge yourself XD,Do not take his class!!! This professor gives poor lectures and his exams will crush your soul into non existence.,"Very terrible professor. Basically have to teach yourself. His tests are absolutely impossible. Doesn't give enough time, and it is very hard to finish in time. I understand the material, but the tests aren't passable.

Beware that this class has a LOT of group work and work outside of class.  Online quizzes are pretty easy but take with a friend.  Overall, really interesting class and Dr. Dye was really funny (and had a really cool accent!)","Dr. Dye is one of the worst professors I've had at U of I. He only communicates through Twitter and is rude and sarcastic when you ask a question. The quizzes have trick questions on them and it's difficult to get a 1010 at every discussion secton. Group projects every week and no EC opportunities. Not an ""easy A"" gen ed course.","As long as you do all the readings, you should be able to get a 1010 on the weekly quizzes. There's no exam for this class, but you better love working with groups online. You have 2000 word papers due every other week. This class was really interesting, and I definitely recommend this for an 8 week gen ed.","He was impossible to meet with, really doesn't care about students.  He'll send you one sentence response emails.  His communication skills with students if the worst of an UIUC professor.  His quizzes were also pretty ridiculous, he would ask anything he wanted.  I highly recommend you look for a course other than this one.","It's an extremely easy course with 8 group projects that you are given specific days to work on them, so meeting with your group is no problem. 8 quizzes that are 10 pts and you just have to make sure you post to the forums throughout the unit. I love this class and the professor is actually really funny. It's easy, anyone will like this regardless","The class structure has changed a lot, and it is now one of the easiest gen-eds ever.  No tests, just 8 group projects that are painfully easy to do well on as long as you follow the rubric guidelines.  Each unit has a 10 point reading quiz which you are given an hour to complete on compass.  Extremely easy A, and he is a funny teacher!",Absolutely horrible. Don't take it unless you have to. The professor complains how students don't come to his office hours and then when you do he makes you leave. He really does not care at all about students. The grading is ridiculous and not standardized. The tests are nit picky. Guest speakers are relatively interesting.,"Don't take this unless you have to. The grading is ridiculous and completely unpredictable. Do all the EC. Yo might be doing fine at first, but eventually you'll get a random horrible grade. Also, Dye is completely unsympathetic and refuses to discuss grades in any way, and he never gives feedback. No matter what, you might end up with a bad grade.","TA grading is ridiculous. If you're taking this class for a gen-ed, do NOT do it. You can do study and do all your work in this class and still may not do well. Much, much easier gen-eds out there.",he knows his stuff! but his TAs are the worst! short answer exams are easy enough if you can answer the 5 questions but multiple choice tests were terrible. do all the extra credit assignments because you will need them in the end. all in all this was a very enjoyable and eye opening class. also he has a hot british accent ;),"He makes the class interesting, but the TA's are extremely picky with grades, and in the end the grading overshadows the class. Do the extra credit, and the multiple choice tests aren't always straight forward.","This class, though not terribly difficult, was frustrating. The grading of the reflection papers was very harsh, and there was no feedback. With that many people in the class, the professor is not very helpful and somewhat unsympathetic. If you want to take ASL, this is a required class. If you're looking for an easy gen ed, don't do it.","This class is definitely not a blow-off class, while readings are not necessary, the tests can be quite picky (4 exams), and the TAs grade hard on the 4 reflection papers. While Prof Dye makes class funny/interesting, I'm not a fan of grading procedures AT ALL, and review sessions are a waste of time. Again, NOT a blow-off class!!","Attendance not mandatory for SHS 222, only two exams, readings not necessary, interesting movies, overall pretty great class. I learned a lot more than I thought I would and Dr. Dye actually made things fun.","Although this class has the potential to be interesting, the grading is frustrating to the point where it takes away from the class. Even if you do what is asked, you may not do well. Doing reading isn't necessary, he goes over all of it in class. Very slowly. A generally nice guy, but not at all flexible. Not the class I was expecting.","I love him!! He's so cute and funny (makes it easy to pay attention in class). Policy changed, now there's more than just 4 exams (weekly quizzes, but they're easy). Take this class! Really interesting.","He has very fair expectations, except you only have FOUR grades which are the FOUR exams. He is very reasonable and easy to communicate with. Attendance is mandatory due to a ""sign in sheet"" that you have to sign at every lecture."
24429,3.0,Michael,Dyer,128,0.4232890746537194,This class is SO hard. Do not take it on campus if you are not going to be a finance major. We have pre-lecture videos that Dyer makes and they ultimately never make sense as someone who has never taken a finance class before. Exams arent curved and are decently difficult. UIUC needs to re-evaluate having this as a business core requirement.,"I think the biggest problem is that the professor does not pace the course very well. The first few weeks classes were canceled a lot and we have 50 or 0min lecture+50min discussion per week and we only went through 1-2 chapters, but still we had a major test and a group project. Now we'r going 2 chapters a week. I hope he could balance it out.","Took this online &amp; this class was hard. No extra credit for the online class, but it is easier because you don't have to go to class. Homework assignments due Fri., lecture ""quizzes"" due Tues., 2 online quizzes, 2 group projects (not bad if you get a smart group), &amp; 2 midterms (not cumulative). If you can do well on the exams, no final. Good luck.",Sitting in lecture right now thinking about how terrible of a teacher this man is.,"Dyer is a genuinely nice person, but not an effective teacher. You will see when doing the homework how much he leaves out of lecture. And because the homework doesn't take the highest attempt, grades suffer. Much of the material is self-taught from the textbook, and the general consensus is that the TA's for this course are consistently unhelpful.","His homework is a freaking nightmare. You will lose points easily, and once you lose points, you will never have the chance to get full score in your homework. The home work counts on average, and it is really time consuming. The class is useless, and the professor is hilarious.","Dyer as a professor is fine. His tests and assignments are straightforward, though you don't learn much in lecture. The pre-flight videos and previous exams are the way to learn in this class. He's a very nice guy though. You can get an A as long as you do those things, though I didn't learn how to study until after the first exam.",Definitely not a good professor. Pre Lecture videos are fine but you really need to learn on your own. In class he just makes jokes and doesn't really teach.,"Lectures and videos are somewhat helpful, but they go over the same material, leaving them pretty redundant. Also, exams are way more difficult than the lecture/homework material.","Dyer is the champ, if you normally get good grades you'll be fine. Just don't expect to learn anything from the lectures.","His class was... not great. I mean, I was able to succeed, but still hated every single part of it. I stopped watching his videos since it did not help. Just do as many past exams as possible to succeed in the class. (especially if you do not read, conception is mostly drawn from couple of previous exams)","Very jolly guy. He doesn't teach during lecture, lecture basically exists to test i clicker questions, not to explain anything. If you learn how to use the calculator you can answer any test question by clicking a few buttons. Its a doable A for anyone, just look at his old exams, 80 percent or more of the questions will be from old exams.",Fin 221 was a mostly self taught class for me. Classes weren't very helpful and are self driven. The midterms are also challenging. Would take another professor if you can.,the extra credit was easy. the course was set up in a very forgiving way. he did not explain very much of the material and you had to read a lot. he made simpsons jokes more than he taught,"I may have an unpopular opinion about Dyer, but I thought he did a great job explaining things in class. As long as you come to class actually ready to learn and pay attention every single time, the material is not difficult. However he has a ton of material to get through in this class, so he can't spoon feed every problem to you. Great guy.","Super nice guy and lectures are relatively entertaining. Though entertaining, he does not cover hardly anything that is tested on. The weekly homework is fairly challenging and a much better representation of what will be on the tests. To learn, I had to read the textbook.","Really jolly guy, but can't teach. Lectures only go over very basic concepts and the exams are far more challenging than the material he teaches. Homework &amp; online quizzes take a long time too. Hope you get a good TA because they're the only one that'll teach you. People that do really well in the class usually read the textbook.","Lectures are very hard to understand because there is very little explanation about what you are actually learning.  He  tries to explain the material with jokes that make it more confusing.  Also, he writes solutions in the worst handwriting I have ever seen.  If you have him I would recommend doing the practice tests.","Maybe his lessons were changed for this semester, but he didn't use any old videos and actually, well, taught. There are still iclicker questions in lecture (which is twice a week) and two group projects, but overall I think he has improved a lot comparing to the other reviews. He's also humorous and makes the lectures interesting.",For Fin 221 you just have to teach yourself everything because this guy just shows old videos that he says you have to watch but they're just a waste of time. If you want to get an A just do all of the previous exams and you should be fine. Go to lecture not to learn but to get easy i clicker points which can be extra credit. The final optional.

I even took the class in high school and am still struggling...nice guy but just cant explain things well.","Doesn't really know what he's doing... lectures are straight from the textbook, he basically just reads the definitions and maybe one example. But it's all in the text so there's no point in going to lecture. Even then, he still manages to mix things up... maybe he does know what he's doing but he's REALLY inarticulate. It's more efficient to read",Wow I dont think I've had a guy so unprepared to lecture his classes. He mixed up domain and range for the entire first lecture. On top of that he takes a week vacation the week before the first test and leaves a TA that can barely speak english to teach the class for him. nice guy but not a professor for a person just starting calculus

Rubric seems fair  but looking at the grade posted, you just have no idea how you lost 30% of the paper grade. Have written many papers before, all As. Got a C in this one, no idea why. Is this a suitable paper for a 100 level class anyway? Don't think so. Exams were okay but be prepared to read","The class went well having many different lecturers, but having the professors as a TA made the in class quizzes much harder than what the other students received. He also grade our papers and exams harder. The class itself was easy though.","I took one summer course from Professor Ebel to fulfill graduation requirements and it ended up being one of my favorite classes I ever took while at U of I. He is incredibly knowledgeable, a good speaker, and a genuine person. I would recommend him to everyone.","I love Professor Ebel! He is so knowledgeable about his subjects and genuinelly cares about his students. He is really easy to talk to and an excellent resource if you need help with anything. He is very encouraging and wants to see everyone do his or her best. While he is not the easiest teacher, you will learn a lot and get to know a great person","I had him for HIST 289 and not PHIL 110, but this class was harder than I expected (from  the reviews up here, I thought it would be a breeze.) Exams are kind of tough. He gives you the essay questions in advance and doesn't expect very much, but the multiple choice is ambiguous and asks very detailed questions about the readings.","Professor Ebel only lectured 3 times, but he is a very good teacher and course administrator. The course is an easy A if you go to class and can write decently.",Ebel only lectured like 3 days during the semester because the different religions are covered by faculty members whose specialties are that religion.  Only 2 exams (easy multiple choice) and 3 short papers (~3 pages each).  Readings were unnecessary if you went to class and review sessions.  Very interesting class!,"A lot of reading in this class and going to lectures if you want to survive, mandatory discussions.  He is an excellent public speaker, but most of the time you get random professors from the department teaching the different portions of the course.  Some of them which were horrible a teaching--Ebel teaches the final section--Excellent."

His commentary during the lecture helps. After a test which everyone did badly, he decided to give us some hints and make it a take home test.

AVOID AT ALL COSTS!,"Had her for calc III. Not bad for her first time teaching, but the class if very fast paced and you will need to study a lot just her lecture notes. Very organized lecturer though and easy to see the key topics that will appear on the exam. Lots of homework for this class and exam questions are usually like the mock exams. Be ready to work","I like her, she's so cute. Cute accent, cute face, cute teaching style. wow",not bad

If you read the moodle presentations and attend lectures, the material will be easy to understand. I would advise being sure that you have the right level of Spanish to be in that class. Otherwise, some students find it challenging.","She doesn't do a good job of explaining anything. Her PowerPoint slides don't seem very organized to me. The topic is difficult but she doesn't make it any easier. She gives an iclicker quiz at least once a week, and she quizzes us on info we learned weeks before. This is by far the hardest Spanish class I've ever taken. Wouldn't recommend it.",This is an extremely difficult class and requires a LOT of work. She could do a better job of explaining the concepts. She always seems to want to rush on to the next concept when nobody understands what she just taught. I wouldn't recommend this class unless you're serious about spanish.,"The class is mostly grammar review, so it's not really her fault that it's so incredibly dull. Her PowerPoints are literally the most boring things ever and she does nothing to make the class interesting. She's nice, but so boring.",She's adorable! Mi professora favorita!

I really appreciate how well he understood and explained the material, and provided an extra vantage point in discussing sensitive topics.","His discussion sections are mostly a lecture review. He's a fair grader. His presentations are OK, but will be better if he shares them with the students more often. Nice guy, with a dorky sense of humor who make him kind o' cute."

However, he is an incredibly boring lecturer and everyone is on their computers doing something else. If you put in minimal effort you will get an A and he does enjoy talking to students outside of class if you want to learn more.","Professor Esfahani is one of the nicest professors in the department. If you actually pay attention in class, his lectures are great and he seamlessly integrates current world events with his course material. He's always happy to answer questions and take out time to chat with his students. Highly recommend taking a class with him :)","Although attendance is not necessary there are ""quick quizzes"" or pop quizzes which are easy you just don't know when they're happening. He is a boring lecturer and most of the class is on their computers but he doesn't mind. If you go to his office hours he does like to talk to students and will like you more! If you put in effort you'll get an A!","I cannot describe how great lecturer he is. Funny, humble, and caring about students. He is very patient and has great teaching philosophy. I won't hesitate to take any course with him.","Humble, intelligent, funny. Esfahani seamlessly integrates economic theory, current events, and research together. Some days I only came to class to listen to him lecture. He goes out of his way to make sure students learn and succeed, even if the workload was heavy at times.",Very humble and patient with students,"He's humble, one of the best teachers I've ever had. Clear, and interesting slide. Really helpful and wise!!!","Professor Esfahani is one of the best professors in UIUC that I've ever known. He makes sure you get something to learn in the class and he doesn't want you to only care about the grade. He is really helpful if you ask anything both in the class or in his office, very wise and great professor! I recommend you to take his class.","He is the best professor I have ever bee taught so far. In every aspect, he is perfectly great.",Simply awesome. Extremely knowledgeable and best at explaining the content. Has very fair and effective exams/grading system.,"Esfahani is knowledgeable, but this does not compensate for his lack of organization and clarity with respect to projects and exams. He discourages hard work by grading sporadicallynot according to any recognizable guidelines. Many often complain of professors who disregard students workloads in their other courses, Esfahani is one of them.","Absolutely outstanding professor. Extremely clear and very approachable. Class is well formatted, tests were easy, problem sets and quizzes are also helpful. Also an outstanding person from my experience with him. Highly recommend him and his class.",Everything is easy except the tests. The tests are hard because the questions are random and are about the stuff he briefly covered in lecture. There's a quick easy quiz for each lecture which makes attendance mandatory. HW doesnt relate to course and tests are just based on lecture.,"This is definitely a fun class. He really makes this class engaging by adding current events or interesting articles he's found in The Economist.There are however, daily quizzes, so be sure to pay attention.",Esfahani is simply amazing. He is approachable and his teaching style quite cool. Plus exams are not difficult at all. An easy A. And a great class.,amazing teacher...easy A given u put in the work,"He's very caring and understanding towards his students. And on top of that, he has a great sense of humor. If you just go to class, you'll enjoy this course a lot and most likely even get an A+!","He is the most adorable Middle eastern man and you can understand him perfectly so dont worry! Hes a very easy grader, just do the aplia problems and youll do great.  The final is not accumulative and is short.  Great teacher I definitely reccomend him over the others.",he's awesome!!,"Hadi is AWESOME! very open. very caring of his students. He wants the best for your education.

She loves what she teaches and you can definitely tell, which is a great environment for learning. She is really funny and the way she lectures is very conversational, which, I thin, is easier to follow. She gets off topic a lot but somehow finds her way back with that as her example. LOVED her!","One of the best professors I've had here. Very passionate about the material, and is very helpful. Her exams are pretty straightforward...essay format, but as long as you understand the main concepts you will be fine. Relatively easy for a 400-level. TAKE THIS CLASS IF DOROTHY IS TEACHING!!!",Great person to be around. Very funny and helpful. Tests were essay format and not hard really if you know the main points.,"Professor Espleage is amazing. Her exam questions are not meant to be tricky or hard. She gives study guides, and does not require attendance in lectures. There are no assignments, grade is solely based on four 25 question exams (the study guide consists of questions that will be used on exam). Great Professor!!","This teacher loves to hear herself talk. Really tries too hard to be liked. Often talks for 10 minutes about some story that has nothing to do with class, than reads from the slide for 3 minutes than another 10 minute story about nothing. Terrible teacher.",She is overly friendly with us in class. Too busy trying to be friends with the students.,"She is definitely impressive in terms of research accomplishments (I mean, she's appeared on Oprah and other talk shows), but I was quite disappointed with the class (I had high expectations prior to the class.). It's true what someone said - she seems more concerned about being cool or being your friend than teaching. It was an easy ""A"".","If you ever have a chance to take a class with her, DO IT!  Not only is she a wonderful professor, but you'll never be bored. I don't know of any class where about 99% of the students showed up everyday.  She's had more experience than any other teacher I've had and she teaches the class like it's Stand Up Comedy, but you always learn something new",Best professor I have ever had!!!,"Professor Espelage is awesome.  She's a little crazy, but very funny and intelligent.","Very hilarious and brillant professor.  She loves to teach and share stories with the class.  She won't be teaching this class spring 2006, but if you can take any class with her, it will be amazing.",This class was almost impossible to get into and there's a reason for that - the professor is fantastic.,"Her clinical experience and knowledge offered a lot to the class.  It can be easy to become disturbed when focusing too much on psychology, but Professor Espelage has a great sense of humor--the class was almost like therapy!  I'm more sane for taking it.","really funny, really helpful (although I had her for a ridiculously discovery course) I loved her!",Great professor that gives real life examples and makes the class fun!,"This is the same guy who took the discovery version----I liked the actual version of the class too. It was very informative and Dorothy's a great teacher. She is friendly, and takes huge tangents, but I think we get to the important stuff in a roundabout way. Take the class!","This class was pretty easy.  The professor is more concerned with being cool and being your friend then in covering the material, so not a lot of material gets covered.","One of the best professors I have had at the University, probably the best.  Her class is very fair, and she makes it fun and entertaining.  I actually like going to her class.",Admittedly I have her discovery course...but she's awesome... really nice to the lowly freshman too...,"The class was hard work, but it was worth it.  She taught me a lot and was amusing while doing so."

Also get a good Lab TA,"If you can avoid taking CEE 300 with Espinosa-Marzal, please do. Horrible lectures due to one of the heaviest accents I've ever heard. Extremely difficult content. Tests are extremely hard, but lets you retake them, which bumped grades as much as 50%. Homework due everyday, but attendance isn't taken. Easy to just leave after you turn it in."

There is a good amount of reading but the books were easy to read and he recaps the information in his lectures. Top notch teacher.",He's not bad. Fair grader on essays,"Professor Espritu cares a lot about the topics which we teaches. Overall super nice guy &amp; very approachable. His lectures are awful though, very long and drawn-out. Hardly went to class, just did readings on my own. Grade breakdown:  1 Midterm, 1 Quiz , participation, 1 homework assignment, 1 short paper &amp; 1 take home final.","Very easy class. Never need to go to lecture. Never need to read. One midterm, one essay, one final.","I took this class last year. Prof Espiritu is a great guy, and his syllabus is extremely fair. just make sure you attend lecture and take notes.","Great professor, attend lecture and discussion and youll do fine!! T.A's are extremely helpful- Merin and a nice guy that I personally did not have. Great class, interesting","His class is super easy, midterm is directly from the notes. Easy A on the midterm. He knows his stuff and his T.A's are nice (Merin and a nice guy) go to lecture everyday, bc thats where all the info is said (dirctly from slides) Movies are interesting","He was very nice, but his lectures were very boring. His multiple choice tests were very easy, and his study guides explained exactly what would be on the exams. Grades are ultimately determined by TAs though the essay questions and papers.",Highly recommended...class had 3 midterms that were each 30 multiple test questions and he posts a study guide on compass a week before the test. Test questions were all from lecture. The final was only a 3-5 page paper. Attendance is taken but it's important to be there for notes anyways. Extra credit is offered. Take any class with him for sure,Reads off powerpoint slides for entire lecture. Very boring lecture but the info on the slides is exactly what's on the test. Final took 30 minutes. Easy A

I called her on Thanksgiving Day and she coached me, giving me support that was relevant and much needed.",Rigorous in the thoroughness in which the subject matter was examined. Lot's of reading but most of it was excellent. Pretty stringent grader.  You have to earn your grade.,"Dr. Estabrook has high standards, but if the student is punctual, dedicated, and keeps the lines of communication open, you'll find her course and expertise invaluable.","Absolutely horrible professor. You will feel as though you have been blindfolded. Nothing is clear, assignments are ""surprises"", and the amount of secrecy surrounding her course is absolutely ridiculous. This course, as taught by the professor, does not ""prepare"" you for future courses. Most other courses in the department are NOTHING like this."

Exams were not fairly graded and he was a jerk when talking with him.,His lectures were always interesting and he made an effort to make the ideas clear and to listen to people's opinions even though it was a 200 person lecture.,"This is a really easy and worthwhile class. If you think he uses ""elevated"" language to make you feel dumb... sorry, you're just dumb. He's a great teacher.","very smart, entertaining and challenging prof. even for those who dont like literature, he still makes the 75 min class not only bearable but enjoyable. class is reasonably easy, pay attention or read the stories, dont need both (i do both, it makes class more fun)","He uses extremely obscure and formal language when it would be simpler and clearer if he just dumbed it down a notch. This isn't a high level course, and we know you're smart, its better to just be clear. Otherwise, a very informed and relatively helpful teacher. Lectures are LONG and BORING.","He is an arrogant ****.  He constantly talks in this elevated form of speech just so he sounds smart and sophisticated, but it's impossible to follow his lectures in class.  Also, if you have any sort of interpretation that differs from his own, it's considered wrong.","He's so nice and you can tell he really likes what he's teaching, however, you can only talk about a short story for so long in a 75 minute class before repitition and boredom begin to take over.","Unbelievable Professor; I learned so much about not only British lit, but also about culture, history, and the evolution of a society and the modes of thought that define it.","Amazing professor, very intelligent.

He does a stellar job explaining concepts and relating them to real world examples. You will be in good hands.,Wade is passionate about teaching. He carefully prepared every lecture. He is happy to help his students in many ways. He is a professor who is very popular among his students.,He is super passionate and excited about computer science. He shows great care for his students and really wants everyone to do well. I would highly recommend him.,Wade is such a caring and encouraging professor. Loved this class. He's an amazing lecturer and he's also quite accessible and helping. Would highly recommend.,"Wade is an amazing lecturer. His class atmosphere is very lax, yet he has very good control over the lecture hall. He really shows passion in the things he teaches, and he cares a lot about students. For example, he's had open office hours where you can talk to him about anything like career choices. That's a first I've heard of here from a cs prof","There was two professors when I took the class in Fall 2015. He is responsible for the coding part. The material is pretty easy, but the projects are quite different from what we learned. Just make sure you have CS friends that can help you with coding. If not, go to office hours and TA will make sure you understand the concepts.","Was for sure a good lecturer. I wish I had him the entire semester before it was too late. The course was very tough at the time I took it. In fact, it was the lowest grade I've ever got.","His passion for CS made the class 10 times more enjoyable. Although this class sometimes seemed a bit challenging, it was an easy A nevertheless. I truly learned a lot from him! His half of the semester was my favorite.","This class has put me in tough position but I learned so much. Be ready to work for long hours on CS mini projects every week. The prof is great, he is there to help you all the time and there are also TA's. Although I did not get the best grade, this is a class for those who are really into computers and their language/functions.",I think he's a good professor. I had no knowledge of computer science before entering this class and I'm getting an A. If you're having a hard time with the MPs all you have to do is look on piazza or go to office hours and the TAs will help you.,"Very passionate lectures and good grades. The activities and machine problems are really easy. Ok, sometimes you may stuck on the MPs, but you can find quick help on piazza. Exam is also as easy as you can imagine(although, I did not get a full point). Will take his class again.","He's a great professor who cars about his students. I don't know why everyone else is being so harsh. Attend office hours, stay on top of your game and you'll do fine.","No. Take something else if you can. He doesn't care about you. Take him if you want to destroy your academic career, he's great for that.","Wade is a really thorough teacher.  Because he's new to this class, he's always surveying students to see how he can better his methods; he definitely cares about his students! Also, the course is graded out of 1000 points, but there are 1050 points available, so you can get up to 5% extra credit.","This course is challenging for non-CS majors. The work load is way beyond the average for 100 level courses. Expect to use office hours at least 1-2 times a week in order to get an A. His lecture style is different and hard to grasp, but put in a lot of effort and you will be okay.","Great teacher but he gives a ridiculous amount of work for what is supposed to be a 100 level course. But if you attend lectures and discussions, you should be able to score at least a B.",The MPs are really hard and take a ton of time to do. Lecture is pointless to go to. I think his only goal in this class is to catch cheaters and make an example of them. It's not our fault that the material covered in the notes isn't enough to do the homework though! Overall it's not too hard of a class if you put the time in to doing the homework

It was nice to have a professor who actually cared to teach and was passionate.","Professor Farnell is a strict but very helpful professor. She is very interested and engaged with students. For this class, attendance was mandatory. She focuses on your ability to write clear and concisely which helps you become a better writer in the end.",Sweetest lady with a great British accent! No tests but a few papers and online posts but if you take good notes they will be a breeze. Really enjoyed this subject as well.,"This class was very interesting and i enjoyed learning about Native American Culture.

There were a lot of readings but you do not have to complete any of them really. Just show up to class and write 3 essays across the whole semester. Prof is very nice but the class was a bit slow sometimes.,I thought this class was so uninteresting. attendance is mandatory and i even listened in class but i felt like i did not learn or understand anything. there's no exams though..only papers. i would recommend a different gen-ed over this one.,"Took this class as a gen-ed. Being in engineering it was a total breath of fresh air, super easy and interesting at the same time.  No exams, three papers and three compass posts. Also very generous with extra credit. Her English accent was enjoyable too. Definitely would recommend the class and Farnell.","This class was by far one of the easiest courses I have taken. Honestly, I was able to get by wihtout doing any of the many ""required"" readings. Prof. Farnell has good intentions and is obviously very knowledgeable, but I had trouble finding interest in this class (counted as gen-ed). She is very understanding if you approach her as well.","Very nice lady! The material was somewhat difficult to keep up with because there was lots of reading; however, I learned so much! You can't B.S. your work and as long as you find interest in the class and attend the extra credit opportunities, you will do awesome! She's very understanding to a certain extent.","Extremely easy course. Prof. Farnell is such an easy grader, and she makes classes interesting none the less. I learned a lot about native americans while getting an easy A.","This was an interesting course, and I appreciated the focus on Native American history, language and religion. It is disappointing to know that there are still bigoted students - this was NOT a course about ""blaming white people."" That is such a ridiculous and wholly ignorant assertion.","super easy class. learned alot, felt like it was a highschool class. no tests, everything is take home. oh yeah unlimited extra credit. easy A.","What was up with not having any of the textbooks available at the bookstores because the bookstores ""sell chief merchandise""? It's ok for her to boycott places if she likes, but forcing hundreds of students to do the same is just wrong. It was darn hard trying to find those books, especially when one didn't ship. Jeez. Easy class, though.","Recommended; nice, easy-going, definitely knows her stuff. Interesting subject matter, but come to class (notes here are crucial) &amp; keep up on the reading (more handouts &amp; pdfs than text) if you want to get a decent grade.

She makes class interesting when the material might not be. Her tests are super fair, just put in a some studying and you should be fine. Come to class cause she does random assignments for points. Wonderful teacher overall!","I have taken several classes with Dr. Farner. She is very helpful, just a little boring in lecture. Classes are easy. The thing I don't like is that in 494 you have to listen to her opinions. Australia is NOT like the US!","She is really nice and class is really easy. Only 3 exams and 3 short papers.

But exams are pretty hard, so go to office hours!!!",Farrand is an approachable professor but in class he tends to jump around with concepts. His exams are definitely not easy so study.

She was really nice and spent a lot of time helping me in office hour.","She really wants her students to learn and to think.  Not everybody is looking for this in an intro class, but it really prepared me for later classes and the MCAT.  Recommended!",She was always prepared and clear. The class was mostly interesting. The tests are easy if you actually read the book and lecture slides. I would take it again.,"Professor Federmeier is a great instructor in that she creates an atmosphere conducive to learning. She uses interactive demonstrations and videos to help teach the concepts. The grading structure highly advantageous to a student as well. 4 tests, lowest score dropped 30 percent each with easy homework for 10 percent. Tests are not too hard either.","This class does require a lot of effort, but it's definitely worth it - you really walk away with a lot.  There are 4 tests (you drop the lowest) &amp; 3 EASY hw assignments (but she drops the lowest - so you really only have to do 2)  For each test there is a study guide that is EXTREMELY helpful for the exam. Overall: Recommended! :)","This class was not that hard, although some psych majors will find it challenging. As long as you attend lecture and study her lecture slides, pulling off an A shouldn't be that difficult. She doesn't do plus/minus grading, and out of the four exams, she drops the lowest--so you don't have to take the final if you did well on the other three exams."

All in all, a good professor.","Very knowledgeable guy, but does a really poor job of conveying his thoughts to students through lecture. Poorly organized lecture slides as well as unnecessarily difficult homework. You can hardly call it a statistics class, it's basically all theory/proofs, barely applicable to the real world.

He is pretty funny and pretty willing to help his students. I highly recommend you to take his class.,A lot of mistakes on the easy material. Taught the class on a very theoretical level with emphasis on proofs; it was so hard to follow. Not enough examples. The HW was hard. The exams were easy. Did not prepare for MFE adequately because the class was focused on theory rather than computation. Make your life easier and take it with Gorvett.,"I went to every lecture, but I still had a tough time with the class.

Don't take this class if you expect an A either, I am a straight A student and worked my butt off yet still pulled an unsatisfactory grade","Prof. Finke may not seem approachable or friendly at first, but your impression will change once you start coming to his office hours (He's even more friendly if you like (a) Anton Chekov and/or (b) Airplanes). He is extremely passionate about Russian literature and will be very happy to recommend you a few books to read.","You get what you put into his courses- put in the extra effort and it will be worth it.

He assigns interesting texts but in class discussions is very unclear and will tell students that their opinions on a text are wrong. He isn't extremely helpful, I was very excited for his class since I love russ lit but he lacks passion and its a downer","Finke is serious about the topics he teaches, but he is an extremely knowledgeable and helpful professor.

Much different than the other 300 profs","He's rude as a teacher, and he's an jerk. I did ok just by attending lectures and studying from the book. But lectures weren't fun, he attacks people based on assumptions and is too proud to admit when he's wrong","He is funny and super smart. Exam is questions from example during class.  Got to attend every class. Great introduction to finance, prepares you to 400 level classes.",I HATED HIM. His notes are not helpful at all even if you can make out what it says on the board.

Very relaxed, does not fit the ""finance"" stereotype. Got some quality quotes out of this semester. Taking FIN classes is often a guess in the dark. I'd highly recommend Finnerty!","Not as bad as everyone says, or maybe he lightened up his class the semester I took him.  He tells you every topic that will be on the test, question by question.  He gives you 2/3's of the points just for writing down the formula and data you will use.  Take good notes, and get a good team for the project, and you will do fine.","Finnerty gets a really bad reputation from students who received bad grades from him.

Other teachers make the class 10x easier than he does.  Smart guy, but really unfair when it comes to grading.","Finnerty just tries to make everyone feel stupid, he does not use the textbook at all, and his tests are not reflective of what he teaches. The exams are also ridiculously tough and he does pretty much nothing to help you out. Also, the whole class is structured very poorly.","Super intelligent guy. Has a lot to teach people if they pay attention. Always very willing to help, and is very helpful if you ask questions.  Tells you what is on the test before you take it, and if you are confused, go talk to him and he tells you even more.

He's not a good teacher, doesn't use any overhead notes or slides, just scribbles a bunch of garbage on the board. His exams suck.

I just didn't like the guy.","The test material is not reflective of what is covered in class, and Finnerty is more concerned with mocking students than with helping them. Also grading is inconsistent. He says that thanks to his investments he has ""more money than I know what to do with"" - so why doesn't he retire?!","He's hard as hell.  He's a decent teacher but maybe if he spent less time trying to make his students feel stupid and doing examples of his lessons, the class average on the exams wouldn't be a 70 (and the class is not curved).  His test tend to have like 4 questions total which really blows if you get one thing wrong, and they're a lil tricky."

The lectures could easily be 50 minutes, but she takes 80. I also frequently wonder whether she fully understands these concepts during her lectures, or is just reading off the book...","Taking Fireman's STAT200 this semester, and I'm pretty sure I would like to take her classes again. She is organized in explaining stuffs, and provides detailed study guides for each exam. It should be a fun class even if you didn't have fun with math in the previous, and it prepares me well for stat400/410.",Online lectures are very clear and easy to follow. Class itself covers a lot of material and can be a little difficult but she prepares you for the exams really well and provides lots of resources for studying. Require work to do well but I learned a lot in this class.,Wonderful and kind,Fireman is very nice but sometimes confusing in the way she explains things. The material isn't too hard though and you can figure out what's going on by following her examples in the textbook. All lecture videos are posted online so attendance is not mandatory but you can get extra credit with clicker questions.,"Highly recommend! Great class, very well structured and interesting.","Hated this class as an online class. You just watch lecture videos that were actually done by Karle Flanagan (who is great). Homework is extensive and tests aren't that hard, but just overall boring and I forgot I was in it most of the time.",Fireman is okay at best. Just pay attention and you can get a good grade.,Awesome!,This class was easy as long as the lectures were watched and the homework was done.  If you do what's required it's an easy A.,"Fireman is really helpful &amp; she uses interesting examples.  Still like in any math class the temptation to fall asleep is real.   A lot of people say it is easy A, but I guess that's true if you're naturally great at math.  I had to work for it but it wasn't impossible.  You can guarantee like a 2% overall grade raise if you do all the bonus work.","I think she is a fairly good lecturer. Sometimes, it gets really boring and tiring going to class, she is really funny and makes Statistics interesting. It is worth taking the course. I recommend it. You can just watch videos at home if you just want to take a nap.","Professor Fireman is a little weird and funny at times, but her ability as a lecturer fell short of my expectations. She's very friendly and offers plenty of extra credit, but she's not very well-spoken, often struggling to explain and losing her train of thought. I had previously heard good things about her, but her STAT 200 lectures were a bore.","The class is easy; I managed to get an A without much effort. That being said, Fireman is an absolutely dreadful lecturer and her speaking style often contains a great many words and little content. She tends to dawdle on examples and I often fall asleep during the class. However shes a funny lady and very relatable. Gives lots of bonus credit.",Love! Dr. Fireman is awesome (and hot)!,"Very helpful, clearest math educator I've ever met. Very passionate about teaching. Wrote the textbook herself. You will learn concepts, not just formulas. Go to office hours! You will get an A if you go there, they will explain everything. Videos of the course are offered online so you can miss classes and not fall far behind.",The class is interesting and fireman creates most of the material herself. She teaches in a way that gets my attention and I wish most teachers taught like her. She understands that different students learn differently and that we do not like those boring text books that take forever to get the point across.,She is amazing! You will learn a lot of valuable things about Stats,Best class I've ever had! It is easy because she is making everything so clear!,She has been my absolute favorite teacher to have here on this campus. Super easy course and it's fun to be in class for once

1263334,3.2,Amy,Fischer,13,0.5526300002794914,Very nice. Her instruction is very clear.,She is extremely difficult as a professor to talk to and as a grader. She is very subjective and despite you knowing the information will not give you a fair grade on exams and projects.,She's a great professor. I really enjoyed this class. There's a short online portion every week (2-3 short articles) with a easy 10pt quiz that you can take 3 times. There's 2 lecture sessions a week and they almost always let out 20 minutes early. It's really easy but you have to go because she gives pop quizzes.,"She's a great teacher! She knows a lot and explains material very well. She's a fun teacher and the material is easy to understand. I highly recommend this class! As long as you do everything, you should get an A!","EASY class. No final. Just go to lecture and discussion, do weekend posts, and take a few quizzes. Class is a bit one sides (animal rights) so it may make some people mad. Some weeks are very emotional too. Guests speakers are great overall. This class is great to take with ANSC101 if you want conflicting viewpoints.","Great class to take if you want an easy gen ed. All you have to do is go to class.There are no exams and only 4 online quizzes. The reading is easy and you don't even really have to do it.There are some interesting guest speakers too. If you like animals, its a great class for you. Easy A. =] Just don't use your cellphone in class....","The class itself is fine, but this professor is VERY uptight. She will take student's reading materials if it does not pertain to class, call students out for 'not paying attention' in class, and is very one-sided. I recommend the class itself, but only if it is not with Professor Fischer.","I do not recommend the class. It was a very one-sided opinion based class that did not accomplish it's purpose. I don't appreciate the biased books we were asked to read. Most classwork was about animal welfare, not animals' place in society as the course description reads. I was completely unimpressed.","She focuses way too much on tiny details that are a way to prove you have read the book.  She can't write a decent exam question to save her life - everything was vague or confusing.  She is selfish, not open to other opinions, has no interest in students.  She would be better at a high school.","Class had potential but taught in a terrible manor. Very skewed format, you had to conform to her ideas in order to do well. She focuses on dates and names rather than content or the 'big picture'. Very tricky exams/quizzes. Not very helpful or friendly at that. Would NEVER take a class with this prof again. She has no interest in her students.","Totally recommend this class. Not too difficult. Exams are mostly based off the weekly online quizzes. Excellent class to take for the life science gen ed. Course is all about dogs and cats, so if you like animals, you'll love it. Very interesting subject material, enjoyed the class. It's not too hard, but there certainly is some studying involved.","This class is very interesting and informative. The professor, however, does not make time for her students. Does not care about their level of comprehension, or the quality of information she is teaching. Many of the lectures focus on teaching about her ""causes"" but to not actually convey up to date or accurate information.","material is extremely easy at first, then gets harder. basically just learn about dogs and cats. should go to lecture because the notes on compass arent very detailed..shes very easy to understand and knows what shes talking abuot. my lecture is at 9am and i still always go because i like the way she teaches. need to study for exams and quizzes"
2101226,2.0,Paul,Fischer,2,0.3986638867098634,"Not a very good lecturer, assigns extremely time-consuming homework even if you have gone through all the lectures. Oh, did I forget to mention that they literally assigned a homework due over fall break.","He is a very smart and knowledgeable  professor. During the lecture, he often extends the material beyond the textbook. However, it seems that he is not very good at conveying. It's very likely to get confused during his lecture and you really need to spend time home to get understand.  But anyway, the exams are quite easy."
203314,2.3,Cynthia,Fisher,11,0.4158666235956408,The worst. topic is so cool but poorly structured class and tests are way out of control.,"Topic is extremely interesting but the professors are just awful for this class. If it's not mandatory, DONT TAKE THIS CLASS. The tests are extremely confusing. Good luck. You were warned.","Horrible class. Such an interesting topic but taught so poorly, and there's like 5 different teachers so it's super off-putting. Class is beyond boring and the slides aren't even engaging, literally white background, black times new roman font, no clear bulletted levels, just words regurgitated on a page.","Attendance is not mandatory, but there is extra credit if you go. This class is split up and taught by 5 different professors, so no time to get used to anyone's teaching style.  Getting an A is impossible unless you read the book and memorize the slides. 10/10 would not recommend. Also if you get an A or A- it is a 4.0 a B+ or B- is 3.0... etc.","You have to attend her class to understand what's on her slides. She leaves quite a lot of questions in her slides without answers, so attend her class. Her class is the most boring among the others'. Rmb to refer to yr textbook!! Well she's a nice person. Talk to her and she'll help.","While she was nice to students, she could be a little difficult to follow.  The grade for her team-taught class (psych 216) was based solely off of 3 exams.  Would not recommend if you are a bad tester.","Very knowledgable teacher, test was easy.",She was a very knowledgeable teacher who loved what she did. She was clear in her lectures and more than helpful in the review sessions.,"She was BORING AS HELL! She was the most awful teacher of the 9 we got as part of the team taught Psyc 216. I went to 1 of her lectures and skipped the next 3. Still got a perfect on the test, proving that her lectures were useless. If I ever see her as a the teacher for a psych course I DO NOT take it.",Rude and disrespectful to students.,"She led the team teaching approach to 216... it was very hard to follow and much harder than I thought. All your grade goes into 3 tests, and with differing teaching styles it is difficult to succeed."

But, tried to teach too much material, which hurt the overall effectiveness of the course. Also, the final exam was worth around 40% of the final grade.","The final is worth 40%. I could maybe understand 30%, but putting everything on the end it too much for a course like this.","This was Mitch's first year as a UIUC professor, and I think he killed it. It is obvious he cares so much about his students. I think there are kinks in the format of the class to be worked out, but nonetheless, great professor. Mitch, if youre reading this, keep it up. Also, dont make the test worth 40% please.","Mitch is an awesome professor! He is new, so it took him a while to figure his stuff out but he is a very effective teacher that listens to feedback. He made ACCY 201 super informative and easy. Yes, the final is a lot of points and he is kind of a goofy guy, but he has given us really great opportunities to earn easy points.",Professor Fisher is a very good teacher. He cares about students very much by providing every week videos and prepared well for every class. Every homework is useful for the course and you can truly learn things from him.,"He is very organized and provides a lot of examples and problems, so students could constantly practice. He truly cares. He puts so much work into his course, posting all the solutions and walk-through videos online. The grading is very fair. Overall, a great professor. Take him for this course.",Great guy,"Does not seem very prepared when planning ahead. A lot of the grade is towards tests. Also, seems to try to hard to be funny, which has the opposite effect.","I've found Mitch to be a quality professor. His lectures are very thorough, allowing his students to understand all of the topics. He currently teaches an introductory class, so some may find it a bit slow, but it the pace is reflective of the level. Only negative is how test heavy the class is, which the midterm worth 30% and final worth 40%.","Lots of not very good T.V./movie references. Also, for the first several weeks the class moves very slowly, continually repeating the exact same stuff."
1877184,4.0,Margaret,Fitzpatrick,3,0.5958080407612605,"Class wasn't hard but extremely disorganized. She reused information from previous years on her class website and it showed (she many times forget to change the dates). She also loved to give out tons of little petty assignments. Lastly, she was very bias in her opinion and didn't like it when students disagreed. Overall, the class was pretty easy.","I can't say enough good things about her! I wasn't sure about international relations before, but she showed me that it's a really cool field to get into, and she helped me figure out a few study abroad options that I'll definitely be looking into this summer.","She's truly amazing at what she does! With tons of international experience, she brings in a global perspective like no other global studies professor I've had.

1259730,3.6,Bruce,Flachsbart,16,0.4936768389012038,"Very intense - don't take his remarks personally. I wasn't a fan of his personality. He will make you redo things if he sees that you finish the group project early. Tests are CBTF but straight from the homework. Group project is very time consuming but if you make a solid effort, your grade will reflect it. Not the best professor, but no choice.","Bruce is a beaming oasis of light in a soul-siphoning monstrosity of a class. His last name is pronounced ""flox-bart"", not ""flash-bart"", and he will flox you hard if you slack off on the group project. If you know how to bargain and agree on a direction of progress with him that you can feasibly pull off, he will be very pleased with the end result",Fun class and very informative. The project was super fun and rewarding but required a LOT of work.,"Bruce is a very intense person and has the strongest personality I have ever seen.    The group project is what makes the course difficult.  If you want a good grade on the project you must take all of his suggestions, go to office hours frequently to make sure he still likes your direction, and START WORKING RIGHT AWAY.","Great class (weekly labs, 2 lectures per week, weekly homework, semester group project). You will learn a lot from Bruce, but be ready to work for it. If you show you are trying and come to him for help he will help you; he wont spoon feed you. Prof gives you the building blocks to do the work. Read the notes before class.","Cool material, horrible group project. But only he teaches it so no point in complaining","Weekly homework, Biweekly labs, and semester long project with three presentations makes this class quite a handful for only 3 credit hours given. Bruce is a relatively nice guy. His class is very unorganized and the exams had multiple spelling errors on them, which made the 50min tests a nightmare to finish on time. He grades very subjectively.","Least favorite course in 7 semesters. I found Flachsbart rude and very unprofessional. Doesn't want to clarify vagueness and blames students for lack of understanding. Every aspect of the course fails to teach, so you have to teach yourself, not that you'll be rewarded for doing so. Tests are riddled with errors that make them nearly untakeable.",Very disorganized in general. Tests are disorganized.,"For the semester project, he likes neat gadgets that don't work over useful things that do work (if he doesn't think your project is cool, you will probably fail the project). During presentations, he is incredibly rude, condescending and unprofessional. Interrupted and didn't let us finish our presentation and then marked us down for not finishing","Content is very easy, but the exams are graded to pick out mistakes, rather than lack of knowledge. Do the homeworks and know them going into the exams, and try not to make a single careless mistake (and watch out for trick questions). Very supportive outside of lecture, go to office hours if homework's give you trouble.",Engineering Enthusiast.,"Great teacher, super patient and considerate. Tests are not that difficult. But a lot of homework every week.","awesome professor. lecture attendance is a must but he pretty much tells you exactly what is going to be on the exams. very helpful in office hours, and always has time for students. only con is that labs are a pain in the ass. even so i recommend him.",avoid if possible,Very exciting class.

Initially I hated this class but began to like him as a professor and the material became very interesting. Definitely a hard class but I learned so much. Best powerpoints on campus. Great guy!,Exams were extremely difficult but class was curved.  The homework takes forever but I learned a lot.,The class/homework/exams are really hard but he gives a really strong foundation for the large amount of material that he has to cover.

Karle is such a sweetheart too :),"Karle Flanagan is the best math professor I have ever had. I HATE math classes but her class made me consider picking up a Stats minor.

If you score perfectly on the papers, you need only a 75 on each of the two tests to get an A- in the class.","best guy. i went in for help because i didn't understand something and he was amazing. his accent doesn't hurt either. take this class, you'll do wonderfully!","Pretty easy class- only 5 short papers and 2 mc exams. You don't need the textbook. uses lots of current events, great TA's, loved the british accent! he seemed like a really nice guy","Easiest class I've taken at UIUC! Go to lectures OR read his book: they both say exactly the same thing. Writing 1 page papers to hi exact guidelines is a pain, but who cares? You only have to write 5 pages all semester!

Just take notes &amp; go to lecture. Discussions highlighted main points. Essays were easy if you just follow guidelines. Tests are not too difficult if you actually do the readings (questions can be specific).","""Calling me Courtney is an earned privilege so you all will refer to me as Professor Flint"". What a great first impression. Also bragged about her money and properties she owns - hated going to class. Exams were very specific so do the readings on time and then reread before exams. 4 papers with 3pg MAX, no minimum. Attendance taken in lect&amp;disc.","She was a great teacher that really challenged everyone's common thinking about the environment and showed us interesting material.  Her expectations were reasonable-low, she expected you to attend class but the discussion ""quizzes"" were easy and so were the exams.

975115,3.2,Karen,Flynn,16,0.43576296272957515,"Prof. Flynn is the type of teacher who will treat you as she likes to be treated; she is understanding and caring and flexible, though admittedly a bit disorganized (aren't we all?), so if you want a professor who is rooting for you every step of the way, then Prof. Flynn is an instructor who will do just that. Utilizes Student-Centered Pedagogy,","Grades are very arbitrary and she is incredibly disorganized. Assigns some religious reading that has little relevance to the topic at hand, and she is very unclear about assignments. She is very defensive as if she thinks students think she is a bad professor and by doing so, is a bad one. I really wanted to like her but she was awful.","I took this for my soc minor so I felt out of place among GWS majors. I still enjoyed the class and felt like I learned a lot. She was very enthusiastic. However, prof. Flynn is incredibly vague about her expectations and gets mad when you're confused. Also don't go against her opinion unless you want a debate where you're always wrong.","This was Professor Flynn's first time teaching an online class, and she was extremely reasonable and flexible; she noticed the workload was a bit much at first and tweaked the course to suit the needs of her students. If you email her and discuss things with her, she will be there for you, and she really wants to help you and everyone else succeed.","I would avoid Prof Flynn at all costs. She is passionate, but is very unclear what she expects on papersprojects. Takes a very long time to grade. Gives pop quizzes. If I had the opportunity, I would have dropped the class. I honestly did not learn anything new in the GWS field, unlike other GWS classes I took this semester.",One of my favorite professors at U of I.  She is very knowledgable and wants to be as helpful as she can be for students.  Frequently asks if we had questions and wanted feedback throughout the semester.  She is also a lot of fun to have as a professor.  I would recommend to anyone.,Professor Flynn is honestly the worst professor I've ever had. We watched 5 films throughout the course and she wouldn't even stay for the film. She would put it in and then leave. Then when she found out we were doing the same thing she lowered our attendance grades. Attendance was mandatory but I got absolutely nothing from class.,"I hated this class with a passion. We barely talked about the readings, and for the end of the semester group essay she accused almost half the class of plagiarizing. However, the class was fairly easy to pass.","Class is a breee. Not test of final. Only quizzes. The quizzes are tricky. Teacher is not professional. Cusses up a storm, bad attitude, and does not respond to emails yet send dozens of forwarded messages. Dreaded going to class.","SUCKY Class. It appears easy- no REAL quizzes or tests... and 3 5-point ""reflection"" papers all based on your opinions. BUT! There's only 100 points in the class so you lose 10 points and kiss an A goodbye. You have to a ton of reading to get all the participation points and all of the readings are BORING AS ****. NOT an interesting class.","This is a great class, quizzes are easy, only 1 exam and no final. Anyone who didn't pass the exam didn't use the study guide or read the readings.","She is decent professor, but she let the TA be in charge of all the grades, and then stood by that TA when she screwed over more than half the class on the final.  If you want to receive an unfair grade, then take the class.","She is very cool and nice but really likes to discuss readings from the homework. I never read but still made it out okay, but wish I would have read some for sake of class participation",She is a good teacher but  often uses class to further her own feminist agenda.  Very opinionated and likes to debate. Don't question anything she says unless you want her to argue with you.  The class is easy though!,She is an amazing professor and the Introduction to the African Diaspora is a great class.,"She is very knowledgable, and her lectures are very interesting. She is always up for comments or questions. She doesnt really believe in tests, so there is no final. Instead theres a group project, which isnt all that bad. Also the midterm is not that hard either, as long as you go to class and take notes. Recommended class/professor."

The class is a lot of work- quiz and discussion post every week, three 750 word papers- but it's also a double gen ed. He makes even the most boring content interesting just because he's an engaging teacher and just a funny guy. Really open to feedback as well. Definitely recommend","Charles is definitely one of the real gems of this university. Whether it be the feedback he gives or the compassion and genuine interest that he shows during his lectures, Charles definitely is a professor that everyone should have. Take his class seriously and you will definitely get something out of it.","This is the best educator I have ever had in my entire life. He is down to Earth, funny, and really cares about the content and how it comes across to the students. He will work with you if you have any problems and the coursework is always reasonable. This is my third class with Charles and if you are thinking of taking a class with him, DO IT!","Charles is great! He's a nice guy and he talks a lot about going to Lesotho. He has an really high vocabulary for someone as chill as he is. Shows us pictures of his kids, who are adorable. Clearly loves what he does and cares about his students. Can't recommend him enough!",Great professor! Very energetic and helps you with all assignments. Even if you submit late he will only take a few points off.

You've definitely got to get out of your comfort if you want to be able to find the sources for your articles. The papers are very short which is the upside. Lectures were long and filled with fluff. I imagine this class can be awful if you have a very subjective TA grading your papers.","If you take this class online, definitely invest in the textbooks. I did not have a ton of interaction with Professor Follis, but she is a solid teacher. She was also very accommodating when I had computer trouble while taking the final and allowed me to re-take it. A pretty interesting advanced comp class!","This class is not hard at all and easy to get a good grade as long as you do the work. Do it ahead of time and you'll be fine. I hate to say this, but I recommend taking this class online. I do feel like I learned something... but class was pointless and was very boring unless there was a guest speaker. She's nice and approachable though.","Average at best. She knows her stuff, but lectures aren't good unless she brings in a guest. Not Ideal when she's the professor.","She is very nice, but I don't know why this class isn't online. Less than 30% of students attend lecture, and you don't really need to because the quizzes are all online, no exams and no attendance taken. Assignments are graded by TAs and A LOT OF WORK. I wouldn't recommend this class unless you're a journalism major.",Nice and level-headed lady. Understanding of life situations and late assignments.,"She's passionate about what she does, but she doesn't respond to e-mails right away. You need to be in class to understand what's going on. The assignments are reasonable, but they will take time - do NOT put them off until the last minute.",I highly recommend everyone to take her JOUR 200 class for advanced composition! AWESOME class!,"She's an amazing professor and makes lectures interesting. Get a head start on the assignments, the bigger ones can't be left until the last minute. She really let's you experience the world of journalism firsthand, which isn't what I expected from an intro class. Two exams that aren't hard as long as you've shown up to lecture and read the books.",This is my first journalism course and I enjoyed it.  Assignments were fun but exams might be tough.,She's a great teacher! Ask her for help if it's ever needed and coming to class is beneficial. Plan ahead and don't leave assignments until the last minute: t won't work out .,"Follis is a great professor and makes class enjoyable. You'll want to go to lecture because they are so interesting. Get the books, show up to class, and enjoy it.","Such an easy class! There are three tests which are not cumulative and the rest is assignments and papers. So easy, especially if you come to class.","She has really high professional moral standard of what is a good journalist, and how to be a good one. Through the intro to Journalism, she also strives to give you a good foundation of making you one. Although her classes are not mandatory to attend, if you don't, you won't pass.","As a biology major, I was displeased to take a course  to fulfill my Adv. Comm.  requirement. I took journalism because I heard it was a relaxing class with flexible assignments. However, I fell in love with journalism and even ended up doing the James Scholar Honors project with her. She is there to help and will talk w you about anything!","She's a great professor! very inspirational and makes you do your work! This is definitely not an ""easy A"" kind of class! so be prepared to work for your grade!","For every assignment you have to interview people. The lectures are extremely boring, so I stopped going. Your assignment grades depend on how hard your t.a. grades. The tests are kind of tricky, so you should study well for them. The class isn't too bad though.","I did fine without going to lectures (though I did take journalism classes before and was familiar with the material). I happened to get an easy TA grader, but it may vary. Only thing I had trouble with were the in class tests (2 of them), so be sure to study!","Lectures were mostly pointless to attend. I stopped going after two weeks, and I ended up with a 95 in the class. As long as you understand the assignments and look at the grading rubrics, you should do well in this class. Tests are not bad, just make a class-wide google doc for the study guide - that was awesome! Easy advanced comp gened.","This class was the worst class I have ever taken at this university. The lectures are pointless to attend. Don't bother going before an exam for a test review, because she doesn't give one. Her TA Clara is horrible worst grader i have ever had beware if you have her! You have to work very very very hard to do well in this class. No one liked it"
1907208,2.5,Lena,Folwaczny,58,0.35772002761142807,Her lecture sucks. You can barely see her handwriting even if you sit at the front 5 rows in the lecture hall. She simply reads her note for almost every lecture,"Horrible as a teacher, has no idea how to teach a class and has no idea about the material whatsoever. Do not take, your other option is probably Guzman, she is horrible as well, but still better than her.","Ok, so I couldnt focus during her lectures 1) I had it at 8 am. 2) she talked very fast and her back is always towards you. 3) she never really explained how to do the examples she just wrote the answers beneath them which made the quizzes hard to do. I mainly used Khan academy to teach myself.",You know somethings wrong with the professor if the class avg is 50-60%,If you can learn by watching someone scribble nonsense on the board this is the class for you.,1. Terrible lecturer. Spends the majority of time writing out the solutions to problems but scarcely explaining the material. You're better off just going on Khan Academy everyday to understand how to solve problems. 2. Rushes and speeds through the material while somehow barely teaching. 3. Don't get her as a TA. She just solves problems FOR you.,Rushes through topics at the end of lectures which most of the time end up being more important topics. Test questions can be challenging if you do not intuitively understand the concepts. However she is very nice and approachable outside of class.,Terrible,"Lectures are great, but the grading is not very friendly.","Calc 1 was difficult, but if you put effort into solving the homework problems, show up to every lecture and discussion, and do all of the practice tests and quizzes you'll be fine. She did make the exams more difficult than previous years, but if you really know your trig and exponential rules you can figure out any problem. Exams are curved too.",Take this test at your community college because it is really hard at uiuc. The test averages are 55%-65% for each test with no curve and make up 75% of your grade. The other 15% being quizzes and hw which is extremely tedious. I've never gotten below B in any class in college except now and I deem myself a fairly good math student.,"She made a lot of mistakes and wasn't good at explaining the material. However, the TAs were solid sources of help and there are a ton of resources for this class outside of class. DO THE PRACTICE QUIZZES AND EXAMS! They are EXACTLY like the actual exams that she gives. Also do the hw, it really helps but its only 2% of your grade.","Guaranteed nightmare. If you take this class, you will have to learn all the material by yourself. Stopped going to class because all Lena does is scribble incoherently on the board rapid quick. My hands got cramps from trying to write so fast lol. A Jackson Pollock painting makes more sense than her lectures. Asking her for help? You're dreaming.",Her lectures are a hot mess. They are extremely unhelpful. Calc 220 is a standard class for many majors and should not be impossible but the way her class is structured is set up for student failure. I do not reckoned taking! There is also and extreme amount of WebAssigns! Her tests are also impossible and no matter how many practice exams you do!,"Be prepared to teach yourself everything using the textbook. Her class is extremely difficult, everything is unorganized, and there is an extreme amount of homework via webassign. Highly advise against taking her class. Also, she makes all exams much harder than last years.",Lena is a great professor in MATH220!! She and her notes are so well-prepared and well-organized! She is also easy to communicate with during class. :),She is extremely difficult and not helpful. Her lectures are not helpful. All of the test and quizzes are much more difficult than the previous years. She gives a large amount of homework that take a lot of time to complete and doesn't help you better understand the topic. 3 web assigns per week with about 25 questions and weekly quizes.,"Just an awful teacher! She barely explains the problem when she is doing it on the board, only repeating what she is writing and not explaining it. She makes the quizzes and exams much harder versions of the previous ones. She should not be the ONLY 220 teacher available (shouldn't be one at all), we need Bob Murphy to teach, not Lena!","Lena is an incredibly sweet and empathetic person. The nature of Math 220, however, does not quite match her personality. I put in about 20 hours a week for the class and was successful- you need to work for this class. She cares about your success, so please take advantage of the resources provided (tutoring hours, office hours, practice exams).","Prof usually goes over example problems during lecture. Hence, hard to pay attention during class. Additionally, seeing a problem being done and doing the problem is different. Provides about 10 quizzes and tests for each quiz/test so do them like your taking the real thing. People complain about prof but course is doable with time and repetition."

Gives out quizzes that are 5% of the final grade, tough if you don't read the books. Tests are easy, spark notes is the only studying required. Nice,but lied when she said she only gives out A's and B's. Apparently an average test grade of an A- equates to a C+ in the class",I loved this class! Foote is hilarious and down to earth. she definitely knows who her audience is! really easy,"Great professor!! Super easy, just sparknotes the books before the four quizzes and you'll do great. One of the best professors I have had. Very funny","I had fun in her class.

Extremely easy easy A and easy gen ed! Just read a couple of short stories and some books and you WILL do fine! Great sense of humor, very helpful, and so kind. The books are easy. The mid term and final are super easy, but you have to actually read the books and stories, and come to lecture.","This is lots of reading to do, not all the books are fun, and there can be a few tricky questions on the tests.

Her lectures are entertaining and the books are relatively simple.  Go to lectures (she tells you everything you need to know for the quizzes) and read the books for an easy A.,"Good teacher. Keeps lectures interesting, and can relate to the students.  The readings aren't bad at all, and there are no assignments except 4 quizzes and 2 exams which are pretty easy if you do all of the readings. I would recommend this class.","Stephanie is an awesome professor. 103 is an easy class, but there is a lot of reading.","Great class! Honestly, I don't usually like to do the reading for my classes, but the books in ENGL 103 are really FUN and INTERESTING. And lecture is really interesting too--I actually wanted to go to this class. Only advice: don't underestimate the final.

Once in a while he will throw a tough exam at you, but he curves pretty generously. He is inspirational and cares about the student if you go to office hours.","Honestly he isn't that bad. Yes, his lectures are slow, and it gets frustrating when not all material was covered, but it's easy to follow along. DO NOT expect to be able to go to lecture and learn it all. You have to read the textbook, you have to work through all of every discussion worksheet. This is true for any MATH 241 prof.",Kevin is one of the most unenthusiastic people I have ever met.  He has a very slow demeanor and can barely get through any material in class.  He gets angry when people ask him questions during lecture and refuses to hold office hours.

The only plus was that he was pretty clear in his teaching.,Not a good professor. no idea how to teach,"Not the best professor but certainly not a bad one.

I'd recommend this guys to anyone","Math 231. Hard tests. BUT, 10% curve on 2/3 tests. 10% no matter what! I got over a 100% on one of them. It made up for my failing quiz grades.","Kevin Ford is too cool for school.  His disposition can make his less-than-stellar jokes hillarious.  Also, he's an amazing lecturer and a fair grader.

Beder is a good TA as well.,"Really good professor with clear lectures, tests were moderately difficult and had some pretty tacky grading, but generous curve.

He's smart and I'm sure he'd be great for small discussion classes. Grading is fair but the TAs do that. I doubt he ever grades.,"It was okay, I did not care for the format of the class nor how the grader graded. Good knowledge to have, but his lectures and readings didn't always have the needed info.  I would recommend it to most.","Lectures are great and there's basically no homework. The required reading can be alot but you can get most of the information from the lectures anyway. The biggest downside is the exams are all essay/free answer and are pretty tough. Also your whole grade is pretty much based on the exam grades, which can be a good thing or a bad thing","Not a good lecturer. Very disorganized and scatterbrained. He had the T.A. grade every exam, and I don't think the grading was very fair. I would avoid him if possible.","Interesting class to take as a gened. He takes random attendance sometimes, and you need to attend 75% of the lectures to make sure you're grade doesn't drop. Understand the overall themes and you'll be more than fine. I didn't read any of the texts, just make sure you know everything on the review guide. There are 3 exams. Easy A imo.","I enjoyed this class. One of the best gen eds at u of I. I recommend it and the lectures are very interesting. He is very organized now. Pleasing him on the exams are tricky (since they are short answer &amp; essay), but they are not to horrible. Do the review guides and you'll be in good shape, don't let the fact the grade is made up of 3 exams scare you.","This has been my favorite class this semester.  He studies technology and spends a lot of time talking about how certain products have developed and affected our lives.  Pretty easy grader, attendance is pretty mandatory but he leads the discussion and the class takes over so very interesting and easy to stay engaged.","I took his class in 1999, his first year of teaching. I did a google of his name and found this site. He changed my life and gave me confidence in my writing skills! He as the only teacher who ever cared enough to give me the gift of writing! If he is your teacher you are blessed!I am now writing a novel and it is because he gave me my passion!",Good guy.

If you like in-class disscussions this is the class for you.  But please be prepared if you don't do your readings he might call you on it when you walk-in...,Great professor I've had two classes with him and I highly recommend him. He always has a class discussion and therefore spares you of the boredom of other professors. This is a class I highly recommend if you really want to learn more about yourself as well as the world around you.,"Professor Fouche was an unorthodox teacher.  If you are looking for a teacher to read notes to you, this is not your guy.  He enjoys debates and discussions in the class, and therefore its not very boring, nor is there very much reading.  The reading that is assigned isn't necessary usually.  Grading was fair to easy, but a very fun class.","Professor Fouche is a kind, witty, and refreshing teacher. He has opened my mind to a variety of new subjects and ideas. His class is wonderful and I would recommend him to anyone. Weekly readings and two papers. EASY!","Fouche was a horrible teacher.With every word being ""um"" or ""so yeah"", he was a useless professor.I dropped the class because it was so boring and got nothing out of it.He forgot to bring the printed copies of the final to class, and everyone ran out of time on the final exam.DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!!

He is knowledgeable of the subject however and is capable of lucid descriptions.",He is very nice and easy to understand.  The material is very interesting and he shows a lot of clips from shows about dinosaurs and prehistoric animals that add an interesting visual.  You will need to study and I recommend going to study sessions before tests.,"he is really nice and extremely smart.  when he talks in lecture, he rambles on so it seems hard.  but you really dont even have to go to lecture.  he makes every test the same and gives you the tests from the previous year.  so if you study the previous tests you will do fine.","very nice man. always smiling and showing funny pictures of himself in speedos. fun class too. you need to keep up with the work, but fun.","History of Life is a great, interesting class.

The labs aren't too bad, but its the lecture midterms and final that will kill you.","The class is so easy...although you MUST attend the labs in order to pass.

Completely arrogant, condescending and unhelpful.",He's an interesting speaker.,"Weed out class. TA's, no matter who you get, will grade papers tough, but they are usually very helpful. Professor Fountain is very knowledgable in journalism and speaks from experience, and the guest speakers are for the most part interesting. If writing isn't your thing, it's probably best to stay away.","this guy is more full of himself than anyone else i've ever met. he devoted his entire last lecture to himself--his journey through journalism, and his journey through his pentecostal faith. how inspiring. read from one of his own stories during every class. extremely pompous and verbose lecturer. sucks.","Fountain's lectures are usually pretty interesting. He also has a lot of guest speakers so you never really get sick of his voice. If you are genuinely interested in journalism this class is somewhat enjoyable. It is hard to get an A, but this is sort of a weed out class. Also, f you don't like to talk to random people, you shouldnt take this class","Yes, this class is difficult but an A is definitely obtainable if you enjoy writing.  Don't let a bad paper grade get you down.  Since there are so many grades, you can bring it up.  I think there may have been a slight curve, too....","He seems nice enough, but he's not the best teacher. The readings are never discussed in lecture, he goes too fast through his slides(which aren't available online), and he might write well but he's not a good speaker.",Probably one of the best lecturers. He genuinely loves journalism and he's an excellent writer. Great to talk to. Loved getting feedback from him. Former writer for the Trib!,"He's a great guy with great journalism experience, but not such a great teacher. The lectures are really boring and seemingly pointless but you have to go for Current Even quizzes. One of the books is okay, but the other sucks. And while I loved my TA, they are instructed to grade REALLY hard, so it's hard to get an A in this class.","Lectures sometimes seem pointless, but there's almost always something interesting or a random comment/theory/whatever that will show up on the test. Prof. has a great personality and all the TA's are really helpful, but the all grade SO hard since it's like a weed out class.","LOTS of reading which is never discussed in lecture or discussion sections but is a huge part of exams, exams include lecture questions from left field, and lectures that talk a lot about the professor's own experience, his book, and the dramatic side of journalism.

Lab was scheduled for 2x a week but was only held 1x week for 2/3 of the semester. No Book.","This class was the easiest class I have ever taken. However,it is not surprising considering the competence of this professor. He is unable to do simple mathematics and cannot answer questions without referring to his ""notes"". I'm not even sure how this class can be considered senior level at a top research university.","This professor taught only during the first half of the semester and then transferred duties over to a TA. There are two projects which require commitment and 10-page papers each (70% of grade). To do well on these, you need to be able to write well and know statistics.

He really did care about helping students to do well in the course.,"Easy easy way to get science credit. He essentially just gives like 65 free points of hw, labs and participation. The HW are all on Quizlet. He doesn't grade iclickers for correctness. The labs were easy and the TAs helped a lot. The exams weren't that easy so I'd recommend studying but I got an 80 and 83 on 2 and still got an A. Don't buy the book","Dr. Frame is an awesome professor and is really nice. Meteorology 100 is a pretty easy class and each of the 3 test are only 45% of your grade. The final isn't cumulative, it's just ""exam 3,"" whereas lab and reading assignments found on quizlet are worth 20%+ of your grade which is amazing.","Jeff is the man! His puns be fire and he speaks well so you won't fall asleep (of course there are days you are tired) and you'll be interested. Jeff is the bee's knees and one day you might at least think what it'll be like to an Atmos major. ""What is the answer"" is basically his trademark.","Solid, easy gen-ed. If you are even a little curious about the weather, take this class! I learned a lot and had to study very little to get an A. If you like puns and dad jokes, you'll like Professor Frame.","Exceptionally sarcastic and unnecessarily loud. Extremely hard to pay attention to. Gives abundance of office hours, but be prepared when you go to not be personally offended by any remarks he has. Extremely picky on grading. Attendance in class not mandatory but 5% of grade is participation which has no explanation to how it is determined.","Frame is a good professor. He is sarcastic and seems to think everyone in the class is an idiot, but it helps because he explains material very well. Exams are easy as long as you study. Go to labs, I found them to be the most beneficial part of the course to prepare for exams. Lots of easy points/extra credit to make sure you get the A.",Lectures are useless except for iClicker points. Answers to the homeworks are all on quizlet so you dont have to read at all. Tests are difficult but questions come directly from powerpoints but it's a lot of material to study. It's an easy A as long as you study a ton for the tests but he also gives you 8 points extra credit for them anyway.,"Prof Frame is great! His class is very, very easy and each lecture has clear explanations and so many puns. He can be snarky/sarcastic. TA review sessions can be VERY helpful if you go to the right one. Reading assignments/iClickers/Labs are easy points. Exams are not cumulative. Easy and interesting class! I highly recommend.","I love Professor Frame. He is so funny and a great lecturer. He keeps it interesting. You need to show up for I-Clicker point and go to lab but if you actually go to everything and pay attention, its an easy A. I suck at math/science and got an A so you can do it!","He may appear funny and quirky in lectures but when you see him in office, he is a different guy. When you ask him questions at his office, he's kind of obnoxious and gets offended when you say that you don't understand certain parts of the class material. Also, giving a 1/5 for helpfulness because for the 2 emails that I sent him he did not reply","Professor Frame is an amazing and pun-filled professor. His class is perfect for non-STEM majors. (And for people that couldn't get in ATMS 120) He's a true weather nerd, and loves teaching. The reading assignments get a little repetitive, but they're easy. You get points just for participating on the iclicker questions.",He is a ok teacher. Could be more interesting.  Tests were fair.  Requires attendance and labs are not boring.,"He would be a much better teacher if he didn't act so snarky and arrogant. As it stands right now, his attitude makes him pretty hard to listen to. I understand a certain amount of sarcasm is alright from anyone, but Frame is pretty over the top. If it's between his Atmos 100 and Snodgrass's Atmos 120, take Snodgrass.",I enjoyed going to Frame's class everyday. He was very interesting and knowledgeable about the subjects he was teaching. His test can be a little challenging but not impossible and they aren't a big part of your grade. He gives out easy extra credit  and the final is not cumulative and its the same weight on your score as a regular exam.,"Tests are not too bad, but Frame is the man. He knows everything about the weather and knows how to make his students interested. Puns are thrown in for good measure. Would highly recommend to anyone needing to fulfill for a gen-ed or just wanting to take an interesting class.

Definitely knows what he is talking about and as long as you do the work you're golden!,"Grossly misled that the final was cumu; was entirely on tornadoes &amp; supercells. HWs are easy, just be sure to ask questions early. Study PPTs well in advance of exams. Random quizzes announced 1 class prior, start studying ASAP bc they're specific. The boundary layer quiz is notoriously hard. Could have done better in the class if I'd studied more.",All the answers to reading assignments are online somewhere. Find them. Labs are all right if you have smart partners ;) Tests are not that easy just saying. You DO have to study. Book is useless. I-clickers every class so yes go to lecture. Overall easy-ish class. Whatever I got an A. :P,"This class was pretty rough. Just make sure when quizzes are announced, start studying the related powerpoint THAT DAY. Study for exams with lectures and HW. Exams questions are asked the same way homework questions are. Directional/speed shear are ALWAYS on the first exam, which I thought was unnecessary. Final is terrible from what I've heard."

He was a little hard to please at times, but he only wishes to get the most out of his students.

One of the most insulting and arrogant instructors I have ever encountered in my educational career. If you can take 402 with another professor, do so at all costs.","Francis may well be the most confusing and frustrating professor I have had.

His questions are extremely vague, but somehow he grades as if the prompts were specific. You will not get through all the books he lists in the syllabus because he spends forever in class talking about things completely irrelevant to the book or course. No rubric for grading, he makes things up as he goes.","He's a likable person, but a frustrating prof. He tends to explain concepts in a manner that is overly complicated and difficult to follow. He also assigns purposefully vague prompts. The plus side is that he's super laid back &amp; incredibly lenient, so it's a relatively easy A. The class just felt completely structureless; I didn't learn very much.","Along with most other reviewers i agree that this dude rambles a lot.

Grading wise hes great, and as long as you try you'll get at least a B","He's a pretty easy grader. He went over ""how to make an argument"" for an entire class, so if you're an English major he'll probably think your essays are awesome.

He seems like a nice guy who is passionate about the material, but he makes it impossible to learn.",I thought Ralphie was bad and then I had Fritzsche. His lectures are extremely hard to follow and sound rehearsed--plus he sounds like he is preaching.

TA's are no help.,"I took this as my ""easy"" class and the workload was. However, sometimes the subject matter was very heavy (emotionally), but Fritzsche knows how to teach the intense subject matter. It's a very impersonal class and I doubt Fritzsche knew even 1 student;s name, but I recommend it anyways. A lot of mandatory reading.",Professor Fritzsche has a passion for teaching about the Holocaust. He often shares personal stories and gives insight on touchy subjects. The subject matter is not to be taken lightly. Some classes he has cried showing pictures. I can honestly say that I loved his lectures. He has a very dry sense of humor that is very funny if you can sense it.,He is very passionate about The Holocaust and gives his personal opinion every chance he gets. His lectures seem incredibly useless. The only thing that matters is reading the novels assigned and writing genuine papers. Seriously read. I didn't and I struggled big time. Discussions are kinda awkward but attendance is taken in discussion.,"He is a very good lecturer, makes the class interesting. However, besides that it really is your TA that does everything else. He can be slightly arrogant. The only thing that matters grade wise was discussion and the papers you had to write for the class. The midterm and final were also essays. Not hard to get and A or B in this class.","Fritzsche knows his stuff.  Super smart.  A bit intimidating at first, but he'll work with you as long you're showing effort.  He's a got very dry wit - I think students don't realize he's joking sometimes. High standards for grading, heavy on writing/essays. He sets the bar high but it's totally worth it.","This professor's lecture are extremely messy and hard to follow. He is overly dramatic and his lectures are overly rehearsed. He spends little to no time communicating with the TAs and has little to do with the exams. The class is essentially based on your TA, I'd avoid this guy if possible.","Fine within discipline, but clueless about literature of non-German fields.  Doesn't like to be questioned and plays favorites.","He is definitely passionate about what he teaches. I trust his information.  It's clear that he knows what he is talking about and has thought about the content of the course. I had him for HIST 142 earlier in a larger class and he was more disconnected. Interesting class, good TAs, good readings, good professor.","Great professor. Took him for The Holocaust- he really knows what he's talking about. However, he didn't make himself available to the students but luckily I had a  great TA. Take this class &amp; take it with him if you're wanting to learn a lot about the Holocaust.","Big lecture means it's all about the TA, since he'll probably never meet you. Depending on the TA, you can skip the endless (and lame) novels assigned. I skipped lectures, read the textbook: he's predictable, and you can guess his view on events. Much more interesting in direct conversation if you catch him after class, though.","Some people just should NOT teach. This guy comes across as so smart and proud and doesn't try to explain things to his students. Instead of him teaching, he goes up there and gives a very general speech about the topic and then disappears. The papers were hard and graded hard even though it's a 100 level non-major gen ed. Stay away from this guy!","I really disliked this guy at first, but several days after our final, I'm really missing the class.  If you attend lectures you barely need the textbook, and the lectures are way more interesting.  He's a great history professor.  Take him if you get the chance - you'll really learn something and care about the material.","My ratings are accurate but take him, he can be confusing, particularly in questions and he can go off on sort of obscure things or get too engrossed (for an undergrad class) in scholarly debates.  However, I am glad I took him.  Made be a better writer by leaps and bounds.  Was tough on that.  Made me think.  Arrogant as heck, but glad I had him.",An arrogant a$$.  He made the class unbearable with his OWN ideals and beliefs about the time period.  Hated going to this class.  Only good part: the final was optinal.,"Interesting lectures, but difficult grader. Thinks he knows EVERYTHING. Made our final optional tho,so that was nice. I wouldn't take his class again","Very interesting to listen to, but not a good teacher. He couldn't care less about the students and is very egotistical.

He pushed me to become a better writer.",A true arogant ****.  Stay away!

It's not an easy class if you don't ask questions, and although he does sound a bit monotone at times he can actually be a good teacher if you get past that.

They're pretty simple to understand and he goes over everything with examples so learning the content isn't too challenging.","the worst professor for ECE110, always stick with Brunet, Haken, or Loui.  He's a very boring lecturer, and just not great at explaining things.",An older professor.  Frizzell and Loui have comparable styles (projector/blackboard instead of PowerPoints) but Loui is the more interesting of the two.,Avoid him as a teacher that Brunet or Loui instead,I don't like his teaching style. I feel that he doesn't get the class to interact at all but instead just flies through his overheads. I attended Prof. Loui's lectures all semester.,"he is a great engineer, but a professor..... well, what will Jesus say?","He is good at explaining circuits, but when it comes to computer engineering topics you are much better off with Prof. Brunet or Loui. For example, a student asked about logic gates, and after 20 minutes of thinking, he could not explain how an AND gate was equivalent to a NOR gate with the inputs NOT'ed, etc. Also, have anti-depressants ready.","He really can't teach.  A lot of the time, someone will ask him a question about the material and he simply won't know the answer.  He is very monotonous and he is in possession of a machine that can make 50 minutes feel like 3 hours.",He cannot teach.

Fairly easy bc she explains everything so even if you didn't read you can just take notes in class. She's genuinely excited about what she teaches and is very enthusiastic.

You do have to read/pay attention though because he expects you to study and work","Professor Fu is one of the friendliest professors on campus. Seriously, I don't think I ever saw him not smiling.

I could understand how some would find his class boring though.","Stop hating of professor Fu. He is a very generous professor. If you have perfect attendance he will give you 5 EX points. the whole class is based on watching 3 movies, writing (3 seperate) 1 page movie review and then taking a take home final (30% of final grade) and determining if China is developed or not. there are also 2 easy midterms","Prof Fu is a very nice and helpful, though his lecture could be hard to understand if you do not know about Chinese. He is generous in grades, but usually change assignments and forget things. Take this class if you are really interesting in China, and you will learn a lot from this class.","Probably the least organized professor I've had. Changes the grading criteria and the projects assigned seemingly on the fly but they rarely if ever get harder. Lectures are pretty dull but you aren't tested on them, all the grading comes from short papers based on movies we watch in class or the dull books read.","Honestly, this is a super easy history class. We watched six movies for the whole semester. And for each movie, we only need to write for a one-page feedback of the movie. I will definitely take his classes again!","Dr. Fu is legit. He knows so much about the subject and makes the lectures very fun. When I took the class, he changed it up to include more movies and less lecturing, which was awesome.

Follow up with your homework and you'll be fine.","She is a tough grader when it comes to your critical analysis. Did not like her grading style, it seemed unfair.",She is a terrible person as well as a terrible teacher.

She's quirky and funny and makes lecture interesting.","She has a different type of teaching method where she writes every note on the board.

The attitude I got from Gambill is that ""if it ain't broke don't fix it"". Teaching CS is hard, but it doesn't help when you have a teacher with a bad attitude. Tests are weighted way too heavily and are not curved at all (midterm 2 is 40%)","Probably the worst lecturer on the planet...I mean the guy's funny in an awkward sort of way but lectures are completely useless. MP's are very easy, labs as well however, the tests are difficult. This is also a hard class to study for. Unfortunately if you have to take cs 101, this is the only guy who teaches it.","Homework is easy when you put in the time. Projects are easy when you put in the time and go to office hours. Lectures are usually not helpful, especially when his slides are so detailed and placed online; I stopped going part way through the semester.","His lectures were useless and boring, and his tests were impossible","Lectures were absolutely useless - get a friend or the textbooks to explain it better for you because he doesn't really care about your grade. Go to MPs and labs because that's where you learn  everything in the class. Stutters and can't really make coherent sentences. Also is an arse on emails., and don't ask him about bumps because he'll troll","Tests are easy if you go to lecture, but a lot of kids skipped because he is a bit boring. MP's can be difficult, but if you start early there are lots of help opportunities. No need to show up to labs if it's far away for you; just do them on your laptop. Not a remarkably good professor, but probably a 4/5.","Lectures are vital to learning. No textbooks required, but the slides are a good purchase.  He's a pretty funny guy if you're sharp enough to notice. I knew nothing about programming and I got an A+ with minimal effort.  Just start the MPs early and you're good. Exams test how deep your knowledge is. Final is not cumulative. Extra credit galore.",Lectures cover things at a very basic level. Exams are simple if you take your time and work out each problem even if it looks like the answer is obvious. The hardest part of this class are the MP assignments.,"Pretty solid professor. Has kind of a dry sense of humor. Very laid back and doesn't really care so long as you do your work. That being said he grades unforgivingly so always use the checker programs. I recommend taking it in the summer, its easier than during the year.","Class is an easy A. All the assignments and MPs are spoonfed with directions. The professor makes lectures fun with humor. The content was clear to me, but I could see that others were confused because he used sarcasm a lot, and they didn't realize it. I highly recommend!","Great class and teacher, but the projects were a little hard.","He's a great guy and good at answering questions; he's funny in a nerdy kind of way (he taught recursion with Dr. Seuss). But I just couldn't stay awake in his lectures. I learned the most when I read the book on my own. The class was pretty easy, but it took a bit of work. You can check your grade on the MPs before you submit them, which is nice.","Really GOOD and nice Professor, and his class is easy, and very easy to get an A, or even A+, so choose his class!","Good teacher overall, difficult class. He tries to make it fun with jokes. Sometimes he can go a little fast in lecture (def go to lecture). Discussions were helpful at times, depending on what we were on. TAs help a lot on MPs so don't hesitate to go. The only book I would def get, besides the lecture notes book, is the VBA book.",One of my favorites teachers.  He somehow managed to make computer science enjoyable and even funny at times.  I would highly recommend taking his class if you have the option.,"Gambill is OK. (I've never been to office hours so maybe he's more helpful there) He tries to make the class fun by making jokes and rambling during lecture, but in reality that just makes it more confusing. Like the others say, go to lab - that's where you'll do code and be able to ask questions. I regret not taking labs seriously enough",This class is beyond easy.  Gambill is also always willing to help.  Great teacher.,"He stutters a lot and sounds like Al Gore from Southpark, but does make you laugh some times.  The material is INCREDIBLY boring. Class is semi-useful. Go to lab. Don't buy the books, the only one possibly worth buying is the notebook he made.  Difficulty of this class varies greatly from person to person. Avoid if possible!","Great Instructor. You can tell he is bored with and simply dislikes the material he is teaching but still does his best to teach us what he can. I got stuck on MP2 and went to him and within 10 min he knew what was wrong and enlightened me on it and then instead of having me just write the rest, he wrote the first half of the function as an example"

OK, sometimes he might appear to be the cure to insomnia, but he cares about his students and knows his material well. There are a lot of resources to help you succeed, and he gives you everything you need to get the grade you want, if you're willing to work for it.","Not going to lie -- went into the course with great trepidation because I had no physics background whatsoever. In spite of the monotonous lectures, the homework and discussions really prepare you for the exams. As long as you understand the concepts and how to apply the equations, this class will be totally doable.",Avoid taking physics 101 with him at all costs.  I'm an A student and I got a C in his class because of the grading scale.  Unless you have a great TA (i didn't) I would NOT recommend taking this class! Gammie does not care about his students and makes this class way too hard for an introductory physics class!,"Gammie was not a horrible professor. While he was not great at explaining some of the concepts in this class and was a boring lecturer, he was an approachable and nice guy. If you know how to do the past exam problems and how to apply the concepts, the tests are not horrible. It helps if you have a good TA. Quizzes are difficult, homework is easy.","This past semester in physics has been a terrible experience for me.  Gammie was not helpful, exams were tricky and not representative of what was taught in lecture","horrible professor. can not teach to save his life. never connects w/ students. exams are not representative of material covered in discussion or past practice exams. earned a perfect score in practically everything but the exams and the final. i still don't understand why. there are curves, but don't let that fool you.",too hard for physics 101!,"I would NOT take physics with Gammie.  He's not that great and expects way to much from students taking an introductory physics class.  i'd recommend the community college, cause this guy can't teach",a word to the wise... STAY AWAY!,All the comments below are pretty accurate.  He was a horrible teacher and shouldn't be allowed to teach 101.,"I guess I'm not the only one who thought this class was hard. I wanted to do well in it but I just couldn't. Everything about it was hard, except labs, which were super easy and just following directions. Gammie's lectures weren't enlightening but the little experiments were cool, yet useless.",Gammie is really not that great.  The guest lecturer on the last day of class was way better than the professor for the course.  Very tough for a 101 level class.    Lecture is mandatory and useless.  Students are given equations with no explanation of how to use them.  I'd avoid him,"Useless professor.  He makes the class way to hard for 101 level class (like previous comments say).  He should teach a higher level course, not an introductory one.  I hope he reads this so he knows what a terrible professor he is.",Terrible 101 class.  He teaches Physics 101 so that it is WAY to advanced for a 101 class.  I would advise taking this class at a community college.  You'll learn more and you'll avoid Gammie altogether,Reads off lecture slides and misleads students by giving them an equation sheet but then expecting them to derive equations on the test that are not apparent on the sheet. Too extreme for a non-physics major course. A physics major in 400 level couldn't solve some test problems. Crams a lifetime of physics into one semester. Final sucked/fast paced,Very boring lecturer.  Examples are not helpful in lecture because it's just Gammie deriving equations.  Homework is taken from the internet and not representative of exam questions.  The final exam is horrible.,"Gammie is a standard 100 level professor.  Nothing too special, he basically reads off of his slides during lecture and seems pretty detached.  Some experiments were cool but lecture seems to drag.  I thought that the exams were a little tough for a physics 101 class, but they were curved.  On the plus side, Gammie is easy on the eyes. =)",No Comments,"He is fine. His lecture is clear and experiments are interesting. There are formula sheets in the exams. You don't have to memorize all of equations. Exams are not that hard. They are multiple choices and well-curved. Grading is quite fragmented, so you have to do well in all the parts: labs, quizzes, exams, homeworks, etc."

But I thought it was an easy class especially if you took calc in high school; pretty much a review.,"MC Gao has a pretty bad accent, but you can understand him after you get used to it.

It is really hard to miss concepts and not get the material. I did average in his class partially because I did not get the material and would frequently blank out on tests. But if you want a fairly easy class and can take tests then this is your class.,Not very good with explaining concepts but his quizzes and exams are very easy and predictable.  I did fine in this class because I already knew most of the material but I wouldn't reccommend him to teach anything vrey conceptual and that needs a lot of explanation.,his accent made it very hard to understand him,"The exams given by Prof. Gao comes straight from his homework, therefore he is an easy professor if you do homeworks regularly.

Over all he is quite nice and helpful, and as for participation, his questions can be a little hard to understand, thus he talks most of the time and he never calls on people unless they volunteer so~","Garret does not allow students to speak, in this small honors seminar he dominated the converstaion and ignored any raised hands. My friend and I recieved B's in his class, the first and only B I had recieved all of college, despite the fact that I worked hard, attended every class, completed all the readings, and went to office hours. Do not take","Great books - Dickens, Eliot, etc.  A little difficult to listen to in lecture but his analysis is pretty amazing.  Doesn't really go into the formal qualities as much but if you should be in an advanced class it's fun to leave them behind for once and concentrate on the content instead.  Weekly quizzes are easy...if you can't keep up with the read","he does seem uncomfortable in lecture, which makes it uncomfortable to sit there and listen to him. he knows his stuff, though, and grades fairly. if you can stand to sit through the lecture without hearing anyone speak but garrett, it's not a bad class.",Clearly knows his information but has difficulty conveying that to students.  Respects original paper topics and will grade accordingly.  Lecture is difficult to understand because he seems uncomfortable.,"Professor Garrett is extremely helpful when you go to him for help, but he is very hard to understand during lectures.  Not a lot of class participation, but that could be because the people in the class.  Read the books and you'll get an A."

She was always eager to help and guide her students to achieve their best. She does a very good job explaining challenging topics (especially if science isn't your forte). Prof. Garrow genuinely cares about her students.,"I've never felt the need to write a comment about a professor, however Garrow is straight up awful. She makes you buy her 200 dollar text book that is just the slideshow that she presents in class &amp; makes you show up to her 8 AM class so she can just read off the slide word for word. She is also condescending and rude. The material is fine tho","I'm not sure why some people rated her so bad on here because she was honestly my favorite professor here. I absolutely LOVED her class and it ensured me that I chose the right major. Granted, the lab write ups and exams can be a little difficult, but if you go to lecture, take good notes, and pay attention you'll be fine.","She is very tough, but absolutely loves food. Loved going to class and she made the material interesting. Helps out if you ask (as long as you get over her matter-of-fact tone). The exams and lab write-ups are tough but interesting.",Her exams were the downfall of the class. She gives you a study guide but the exams are wayyy more detailed than she tells you you need to know. Lab was easy thank god but the lecture was very difficult.,"Professor Garrow is hard but she's willing to help you if you ask for it. It's true that if you have the old exams, you can do well on the exams. However, I didn't have any of the old exams and I still got an A on almost all exams. I just studied EVERYTHING in the lecture notes and in the lab book. Good news is there's no textbook for the class.","She is nice , but it is not easy to get points from her class.","You have to work for an A (90%) in this class, but it's definitely possible. Tests require a LOT of memorization. Labs are fun. Lab reports aren't hard but if you miss some stuff you can get a decent amount of points off. You don't have to take the final if you get at least a B (80%) on all 4 tests. She's helpful as long as you ask.",She made the class harder than it should have been. The labs were the only thing that saved my grade because the exams were ridiculous. The university should hire professors that actually want to teach because Garrow clearly does not.,"Memorize old exams, lecture at 8am brutal, especially when the notes don't help when studying for exams. Not helpful, doesn't seem to enjoy teaching.  Lab was too long.  This class was the reason why I changed my major.",Makes you feel stupid and knows how to point that out to the class. She assumes you should know all the different cooking techniques. That lab is fun as long as you don't burn anything (or she will point it out to the entire class).,can't give clear feedback to students,"SHE SUCKS!  She hates girls, loves guys.  Although she never changes her exams, so if you have old ones, memorize them!",I am so sorry if you have to take this class.,"I was excited for the class, but as someone stated the exams were hard.  Those that did have the old exams were pretty much the only people that got A's on them, which sucks when you spend hours studying and don't do as well.  Could be made a little funner/easier, a little intimidating.",I think she makes this class much harder than it should be.  The exams are VERY tricky and I felt like she didn't want us to do well in that class.  I generally have no problems getting good grades and I don't think this is a class that should trip me up! I was just disappointed in general!,"Garrow was not a very cheerful/helpful person.  Her tests had tricky questions - but apparently if you get the old exams, you are golden.  I did not have them :( I liked the class, not her.  Loved the lab, but the reports are marked off for every little thing.  The project is annoying",Really smart and easy to talk to.

He does an amazing job making sure everyone is up to speed with the material and will take his time to make sure you understand it.

Even 1 on 1 she is not very good at teaching the material.,Does not seems interested in this class at all. The TA's make the exams and they do not attend lecture. The exam can be very unclear and unrelated to what you learn.,"She seems like she doesn't enjoy her job.  She reads straight off the slides so don't plan to get much from the book or the lectures, just go at your own pace as others have said.  I dropped the class and took Kale, he's so much better at teaching.","The book is useless, and the lecture notes are better reviewed yourself than in class where the pacing is skewed, but this is more of an issue with the class than with the professor.  (The other professor who teaches the course isn't noticeably better.)","She has an accent, but you will get used to it after a week. She is approachable and will help if you have a genuine question. No textbook is used, and she will just read lecture notes, but they are so concise and clear that it's not a problem at all. There is a lot of extra credit and curve. Graders make mistakes a lot of time, so double check!",Very approachable and helpful! I don't know what the other raters are talking about. One on one she is very patient and nice.,"When no one went to class the semester before I took the class, she resolved to make attendance mandatory instead of think about how she could make more people come to class willingly. After all, when a student learns more by reading lecture slides than listening to a professor read off the exact same slides, you know there's a problem.","She wasn't very good at teaching and was kind of snappy when you went to approach her. Luckily, the class wasn't too hard, and I didn't have too much of a difficulty. I just would stay away from her."
709054,1.8,H,Gaskins,5,0.3115801891245652,He did not seem to care about this class in any way. He taught by putting on youtube videos that one would watch when trying to review for a high school biology exam the night before a test. One day he literally played Aretha Franklin's funeral for about 20 minutes in order to not teach. I expect more considering how much attending UIUC costs...,DOES NOT CARE FOR THE CLASS. How do I know? Half of the lecture is taken up by him putting up a youtube video explaining the material instead of himself. Copy and pastes his previous exams.,I know he can go a little fast but if you listen close enough you understand everything. Also he is the nicest man ever he rescheduled a midterm I missed due to health issues,"Basically this professor just reads off the slides during lecture.  If you ask questions he helps you, but he goes very fast and doesn't give very specific examples.  Definitely buy the text book for this class and read it so you don't get confused.  Past exams are also very similar to current ones if you can find them.",Not clear at all

A is doable, but lots of unnecessary work. TA was tough grader too.","This class sucks so bad, too many papers, and topics are boring af unless you are interested in super theoretical topics.",This is a solid class taught by a solid teacher. A very easy A with some interesting material. The reading summaries due every class are kind of annoying but it's really easy to write them once you get in the swing of things and all the readings are less than 30 pages which is reasonable. Lectures are also usually pretty cool but sometimes dull.,"Although grading policies were lenient, he assigns many irrelevant readings and assignments. I fell asleep in lecture multiple times because he was so boring. He did make an effort to improve over the semester in terms of engaging the class. I felt like he was teaching for the first time the way the course was set up.","This was one of the easiest classes I have ever taken at UIUC. The professor is really chill, summaries are easy to do, 2 papers, and final are also very easy! No midterm, just a mock final that isn't even graded. Easy as long as you put in some effort. Take the course!","This is one of the worst classes I have taken on this campus. Not only are you forced to go to the boring lecture by turning in reading summaries every darn class, the papers are graded harshly, the TA's are absolutely useless and he changed the format of the final because people might ""guess the right answer on accident.""

The class is unorganized and most of the questions he asks on exams are very open to interpretation, so it's not uncommon for you and the person sitting next to you to give the same answer and receive very different scores.","While the class description is really interesting, I don't recommend taking this class. Don't take any class with this professor, I'm a straight A student but the professor never curved anything and it is almost impossible to get an A+ or A in the class.

The workload is very manageable (requires 30 minutes/week) and though attendance isn't mandatory, I always wanted to go to class.","She's nice but so disorganized; her grading criteria is confusing, and she only wants you to use what she teaches you in your papers. Cannot rely on any other resources, so if you miss class, you're screwed unless you try to go to her office hours. She's the type of professor to go on ""wild tangents"" all the time.",Obsessed with pushing her left wing agenda. I'm not that right wing to be clear but its rough to know that if you disagree with her on something you get marked down. Seems to know pretty much zero about the course but a lot about herself so you wont learn squat and you'll be bored doing it.,"LA221 is basically a class to brainwash kids with liberal talking points. I don't recommend unless you like that. Ginsburg is okay at teaching the subject, but it is pretty much a worthless class. You learn about history of punishments, with a quiz on each. There is a midterm test, but only a final project no test. SO MUCH BORING READING every week","The good: she's very passionate and knowledgeable on the subject, which was genuinely interesting. The bad: SO MUCH WRITING (not long papers, but 1-2 papers per week). Grading was slow. Unclear grading standards, and each TA/instructor graded by different standards, with no comments indicating why you were marked down. Bottom line: Don't recommend!",She is really passionate professor with great capabilities.,"Probably the most different (in a good way) course I've taken in my college career. Couldn't have asked for a better, more enthusiastic professor!","I had 0 interest in African landscapes until I took her course. She has such enthusiasm that you can't help but be drawn into every word. It's easy to see how knowledgeable and passionate she is, and it really helps that she knows how to communicate &amp; interact with the class to pull them into a subject they may not have considered studying before.",Ths was the best class I have taken in my college career. This was a great break from the daily grind of Engineering. I would take any of her classes again because she made the class personal and really got to know her students.,Ginsburg took the time to know her students personally and was willing to work with them for late assignments. The class required a lot of reading but was otherwise very easy.,Ginsburg is very friendly and personal. She took the time to get to know all of her students and was willing to work with them for missed assignments. This class involved a fair amount of reading but was otherwise pretty easy yet still informative.,"She is utterly incomprehensible, and just when you think you might start to get the tangent that she is on, she changes topics again. Disorganized beyond belief.","Not clear about the assignment.  Seems to stutter when speaking in class as if nervous about something.  Ridiculous about how she comments on your grade.  She says, ""You did a very nice job.""  And you get a C.","This professor is ridiculously harsh grader.  This general education course turned my semester into misery.  She is not clear what she wants in her paper assignment.  No exam for this class; however, she makes up for it by being super picky about 7 paper assignment.  Unless you are a genius writer, you won't enjoy this class."

His grading is extremely fair, he is fun to listen to, and he gives plenty of material to prepare for tests.  I would highly recommend him to anyone.","Agreed with most reviews. Only things to add, exams are low points (i.e. out of 28) so missing 1 point is a bigger dent to your grade so be careful.  Do HW, do practice exams, go to class and take good notes, and you'll be fine.  Awesome Prof, funny, exciting (for Solid Mechanics) and he cares about making real engineers!","Awesome professor and awesome class! As far as I know he only teaches in spring semester. If you are taking tam251 during fall, then Starweski will give you nightmares.","Extremely hilarious professor in a 'mad scientist' way. Best part of his class are his hand picked TAs.

GREAT CLAS","Very fun lecturer, in the ""unintentionally hilarious"" way, but still makes sure you understand the concepts thoroughly. Homework is long and tedious, but reinforces the concepts very well, and the exams are ridiculously easy if you know your stuff. TAs and discussions are very helpful for homework, everything is graded very fairly, so there's really no reason NOT to take this class!",Craziest prof ever! And I love him for it. He keeps lectures interesting and many times funny. Pretty much everything he said made me chuckle. But he still gets his point across.

Big fan.","Hilarious, lectures were very entertaining and he knows what he's talking about.",He is pretty funny.  His exams are fairly straight forward.,Lectures were entertaining and pretty helpful. He's one of the few profs that does a good job at getting you to understand theory. Homework was a little long but pretty helpful. Go to discussion for homework help.

His tests are very easy, but the homework takes some time.",Awesome professor with humorous stories.,"Hilarious prof, keeps lectures interesting...exam style is also very good as well-uses all variables in problems eliminating needless calculation and enforcing clear understanding.",Excellent professor. Lectures are extremely beneficial and humorous. He presents a lot of theory in class but the homework deals with more real world problems. He has an accent but is still very easy to understand. Highly recommended.,his homework was nothing like the problems on the exam.  homework is very long and time consuming.,No Comments,"Gioia is hilarious. His lectures were fun to go to even when the material was boring because of his sarcastic comments throughout. As long as you do homework, this class is totally doable with Gioia.",Unhelpful to the point of critical. Difficult to understand and impatient with his students. Avoid.

Her quizzes are tougher than other TAs, and she is a difficult grader on the essays. She holds her students to a higher standard. The class isn't meant to be a blowoff gen-ed.

Giorgio is always willing to meet after class to help you and actually goes out of her way to make sure students are receiving the help they need. She is by far the best professor I've had at UIUC.,"Grace is the best professor i've had as a transfer student! ridiculously easy class she assigns readings but shes so lenient shes doesn't expect you to remember and kind of lets you off. Late on an assignment? she so understanding and will allow a late turn in and she so hot, her mannerism is what makes that tiny lady so interesting and appealing.",I LOVE HEERRR! Easy as long as you do what you have to do. She is very helpful. Best teacher I've had so far!,she's great,"Dr. Giorgio is great. Lots of group work in her class, but most of it is enjoyable. This is not a blow off class, but it is not as difficult as others because she is very engaging and the course material is interesting as well. Overall, I highly recommend her classes.",You will love her. She is awesome.,"I'm taking her now and I would not recommend her. She treats everyone in the class like high school students and brings her personal political bias too much into the class. Easy grader, but with so few comments on papers you feel like she doesn't care.","Material tedious at times, lots of hammering on topics, but very interesting stuff. Prime for involved class discussions, and some very thought-provoking readings outside of the textbook. Movies galore, too.  FANTASTICALLY COOL final project.","Good Class! The tests require you to actually learn the material (instead of just memorizing) but if you have been keeping up with the readings and going to class you will be fine.  Grace is great and the material is really interesting. Plus, I loved the project for the final.",I'd do her,great class ....shes really cool,No Comments,"I like her!

I took English 242 and English 455 (Major Authors-Plath and Sexton) with her, and completely loved and did well in both of my classes. I definitely recommend taking a poetry class with Melissa if possible!","Melissa is a TA that treats you like a baby and then gives you undeserving grades.  She is a tough grader, which I understand and respect for a college level course.  I would respect that if she didn't teach the class like they were children.  Lessons are geared towards 8th graders who have never had a writing course.  I am very upset that she assi","Impossible to get full credit on any assignment. Not sure if this is part of her teaching strategy or she is just a tough teacher.  My writing definitely improved after this class, so it's worth taking, especially if you are a  business major.  All in all, tough grader, decent sense of humor, but pretty helpful.","Melissa was a great teacher.  At first, I had trouble with the papers, but I went to her office hours.  She explained what I needed to do to get the grade I wanted.  Like others have said, she is not easy, but she is fair and wants to help you.","Melissa was a very nice teacher that obviously loved poetry.  She picked interesting things to read and always offered help.  She also has a great sense of humor and is pretty laid back.  It seems like she would be an easy grader, but she's definitely not.  I worked hard and loved the class but got a B+.  However, I still enjoyed my experience.",VERY good instructor- doesn't make the class easy- but definatly makes it worth while being there.,"Melissa is fantastic.

She is a great professor!,"I loved this class. She is not only a good teacher, but an established researcher in lexical semantics. The texbook is rather dry - but she uses many examples of real-world applications of semantics - especially from computational linguistics. This helps a lot. The grader though, was so and so.. but she is very fast in responding to emails.","This was a great class. The material might seem a bit difficult to grasp during the first month, but it definitely prepares you for the more advanced semantics classes.",I liked this class. It took a while to get used to the material (I found the part on first order logic rather difficult). But she was kind and explained the material well.,"Missed many classes, barely read the book or understood the material, managed an A! Bizarre. Doesn't natively speak English, yet teaches English semantics. Very sweet lady though, nice and calm--gives full credit if you just spew out what you remember on the tests. Apparently not good at keeping office hours though."

Very basic.,"Didn't teach anything at all, just went over pre lectures in lecture... wouldn't recommend this course to anyone!",I didn't know much about physics before taking this class and I still don't after taking it. I found everything to be extremely difficult to understand since everything he does is all conceptual. There is no text book so it is extremely hard to study on your own. The tests are extremely difficult however some people found them easy but most did not,Great Professor.,"This class is way to hard for itself. It's a required class for so many majors and it takes way too much time. He's better at talking about Jazz. My disc. was awful too. The ta never really helped. The material doesn't seem hard, and they trick you so much on the exams. Everything mistake possible is there.",He just repeated the prelectures in lecture.,"This class is not that hard but still effort is needed if you want a good grade. For the final exam, it covers material from the LAB so beware!","this class is very different than classical mechanics. I had a hard time grasping the 1st exam material and end up getting a C on that exam. but I end up getting an A so don't be disappointed to get a bad grade. i found reading the book (prelectures in words) very helpful, and lectures were very entertaining!","He was an ok professor, but he tends to blow over any demo.  Also this class is set up weirdly, which adds to the already difficult topic.  I pulled off a B+ but not easily.","Good lecturer, hilarious and understandable.  Go to his lectures and you'll do fine.  Kind of a hard class, but definitively not impossible to get an A.","Good professor but exams are not that easy. subject itself is not easy. lectures are fun with the iclickers but homework, prelectures, preflights, etc. makes this class very difficult.","Class itself for phys 199ho is very difficult, but he does a good job of explaining the material more or less.

Some of the questions comes from the things she said verbally in class which is really hard to get because she talks so fast . But the good thing is she retired so there will be another teacher with MACS 100 .,"Glennon really isn't that bad and is extremely nice if you get to know her. Her tests questions are mainly from the lecture notes but the readings are also required if you want to do well. Overall, this was one of the easier classes that I have had during my 4 years at U of I.","Glennon is a babe. Her tests are mainly from lecture notes. If you pay attention and take good notes you will be more than fine in this class. You also get to watch awesome movies and shows like The Truman Show, Little Miss Sunshine, Beavis &amp; Butthead, and a little bit of South Park. Most of the negative remarks are from slackers.","I really don't see why she is getting all of this negative criticism...I mean she does initially come off as a bi*** but her tests are straight from the lecture (JUST PAY ATTENTION IN CLASS) and the movies we watched were pretty funny (The Truman Show, Little Miss Sunshine, etc.) I studied the day before my first exam and ended up wit",I am currently in the class and getting ready for Exam 1 today. I already don't like her or the class. She picks all these old time movies that are not interesting. I don't know what to study for this exam and she is super boring. Thinking about dropping this class and taking a second 8 week course. Any suggestions ?,"Glennon does not know how to teach a gen ed. Tests were trickier than needed. Attendance is required. The title of this course makes it seem like a breeze, but effort is a must if you want to get an A. I got an A but I had to push myself to study for a course I did not think I would devote much time to. Look for a better option in a gen ed","Do not take this class. Glennon mostly talked about how much she hated Jersey Shore and discussed extremely radical viewpoints of the media that were very disagreeable. If you want to take a class that you will hate, try MACS 100. Definitely not what I was expecting. The film projects are pointless and her exams are impossible to study for.",MACS100 was okay. You have to attend lecture for clicker questions. Her tests are way too difficult for a 100 level class. She gives you a study guide but half of the material isn't on the test. Don't take this course if you're looking for an easy gen ed. This class isn't worth the GPA drop.,"Ivy was pretty cool.  I learned a bunch and she was very enthusiastic.  She's oddly cute in a older woman kinda way.  Even though the class was pretty difficult, I think of her quite fondly.  One of those professors you remember as tough but sincere.  Ivy is great.","This woman takes her PhD WAY too seriously. Yes, she IS intelligent. However, intelligence coupled with hypocrisy is hard to admire. While on the one hand she emphasizes the absurdity of institutional power, on the other, she insists on being addressed as ""Dr."" Thus reinforcing that which she criticizes. She is full of incongruent attitudes.",Learned a lot about ethics.  Course is hard at first but she is interested in topic and makes ideas clear.,"This professor is highly unorganized, yet is a very hard grader. She does not know how to work with basic technology and takes several weeks to grade things! She assigned 3 tests, 2 papers, and 1 groups presentation for this course, and the majority of those assignments were given at the end of the semester. Her lectures are unclear.","Do Not take a class with this woman.  Attendance is mandatory, she talks about non-sense, she is an incredibly hard grader, tons of readings in books and journals.  Tons of work with this woman...plus she is incredibly boring!","Hated her. Besides being ridiculously unorganized, she and my TA messed up the grades for several students in the class. She states her opinions as facts.","Great Class.  Really easy.  If you want to be entertained, go to the lecture.  I'm pretty sure Ivy makes up most of what she talks about.  I studied maybe an hour for the entire class, spent most of my time in lectures doing sudoku, and got a 94. I basically only went to hear the ridiculous things Ivy would say.",I truly liked this class. She's pretty enthusiastic and makes it interesting. The tests weren't bad at all and I loved the content of the class (also loved the book!). Take it if you're an ad major!!! This is for ADV 493 not the COMM class.,"The lecture was a joke. I didn't go to more than half. Go to discussion and put in a decent effort on the project, and you will get an A like me. Also do the online multiple choice practice exams. Ivy is knowledgeable, but a terrible lecturer. Unbearable. Get Matt as a TA. He's hot.","She could be pretty boring, but overall her class was not bad. I was always amused when she would talk about things to imply that she was keeping up with technology. She tried but sometimes she seemed clueless. But overall a good class. Interesting content. If you do the readings and assignments you will do great! I got an A!","Best teacher ever!  Even though her lectures were posted online, she tells you questions that will be on the test and shows examples to clarify.  Don't listent to people who say she is awful or boring!  She took time to know everyone's name in our lecture of about 200 students!  Great teacher and easy class as long as you read the book!  :)","She's boring but the class is fine.

Only problem is the HW was unfairly graded.","Gives 7 quizzes during the semester, which are totally doable in the time allowed. Great lecturer, probably one of the best ones I've had yet.

Be prepared for the weekly quiz and vocabulary though!",assigned way to much useless reading and tested this reading heavily on the exams. this stuff has no bearing on the 21st century and is basically a black hole of students' time. class involves way to much time out of ones valuable day. basically forcing his own interest and fancy upon other students so they can save their grade.,Funny and nice.

The French literature was diffucult for me, but he made it bareable.  He was lenient with the second novel we were  ""supposed"" to read.  Fair exams.  It's also nice his classes are small so you can know more people on campus.","An excellent instructor; very knowledgeable about many areas both related and unrelated to his field.

She definitely cares though, she just seems to not really cover material that well.","Professor Goldstein was extremely passionate and a great teacher. Many people do not succeed in the class if they don't put in the work, but she makes it so that if you want an A, you can get an A. Tests weren't easy, but weren't unfair either. Final project is rough.","By far the worst class Ive ever taken. Lectures dont correlate to the material you need to know for quizzes/exams, and none of the assignments prepare you either.

For example, there weren't specific examples in lecture. However, he genuinely cares about the students. He's a nice person - and I've talked to him about other things unrelated to physics.","Professor Gollin extremely available outside of lecture and is very helpful in office hours. However, his lectures veer of track at times. He is also pretty unforgiving and sends terse reply emails that show a lack of respect.

He is a pretty cool guy though.",Prof. Gollin was very good.,Prof. Gollin is a great professor,"The class has exams that are pretty much like the practice exams. The grading, although vague, ends up being pretty student friendly. If physics has only been plug-and-chug to you at this point, find time to make his office hours and work on the material!

The problems lie at the syllabus itself, not with Prof Gollin, 225 is not any better when other professors teaching it.",Course content is not easy but every problems in exam contains  no more than two steps of math.  Awesome professor!,"He is quite a talented person.  However, he spends his whole lecture answering questions, while keeping the rest 180 students sitting there not knowing what to do.   He teaches nothing in class, though he said he would teach sth in two of the future lectures. But that basically ensures that he won't teach anything in all other lectures.","Nothing special but nothing boring. Tried to be funny, but awkward at times. Lectures were manageable though, just do not have two iclickers because he has the eyes of a hawk and will catch you.","His lectures aren't really helpful to be honest.

He also spreads the work of the final project throughout the semester so you won't be doing last minute work at the end. I recommend this Prof.","Gong is super easy. We only had 4 group cases and 3 individual cases and the grading was very lenient. His 2 midterms were easy (lots of the questions from the practice exams), but the final was a little trickier. He responds to emails quickly and is helpful when you ask questions. Compared to Brown the workload and difficulty is near to nothing.","Really nice and always willing to help. Encourages discussion and the fact that accounting is so subjective that if you can stand behind what you choose, you get full credit. Tests are super hard though.

It is easy to get A. Also, he is very helpful.","If you can avoid taking Gong, do so.  This material is incredibly difficult, and it is that much harder taking it with a professor who is this unclear. The workload is already rough but it's worsened by the lack of guidance in class.  My advice: take a different teacher. Otherwise, get on Gong's good side, it will help your participation grade.",VERY hard class. lectures/reading material not that helpful.  He's super-hard to understand.,"Gong is a really nice guy, although his tests are extremely difficult.  His lectures include a lot of detail, and he does not give enough practice problems. Plus, the practice problems he does give aren't representative of how difficult they are exams.  Earn as many points as you can with homework/cases--you'll need all you can get.","you will do badly on the first two midterms even if you probably went into the exams thinking you're well prepared.  but just keep going to lectures, do practice problems, Dr. Gond is really nice and doesn't like to give out anything below a B- unless someone really deserves it. he's pretty easy going as well. go to his office hour.","He is a nice person, but his lecture is not clear at all.

Overall, dobable class.",It's pretty pointless to actually attend class as there is no attendance and he reads ver batim from the slides. The weekly homework assignments can be tedious but he grades them very easily. The midterm and final were a little challenging but as long as you study you'll be fine. I received an A and rarely went to class!,"Professor Gonsalves was a useless professor; he came in everyday and just ranted off some PowerPoint slides.  His class was fairly easy, but I learned almost nothing about psychology.  It's clear he doesn't care about his students and only teaches because he has to.  Reading off some slides isn't teaching!!!",This class may seem intimidating but the tests are fairly easy as long as you go to lecture and read the book. fill out the study guides Prof. G gives you!!

His study guides are very close to the test so make sure you know everything on the study guides. Studying with groups helped me. The textbook was barely opened and he never makes you read anything. I got a perfect grade and I never read anything.,Really boring lecturer but super nice guy.  His study guides are pretty accurate for the test but make sure you know every single thing on that study guide! I never had a diagram on any test but I have heard he has done that in the past. Sometimes there are in class video activities so be in class for those. I received an A plus in the class.,"I had a very hard time with the tests in this class. For my class the tests were not cumulative THANK GOD. It is VERY hard to stay awake in class mainly because he just reads off the PowerPoints. He also posts all the PowerPoints online so a lot of people don't come to class. Lots of definition questions, study hard!","Wonderful teacher who is dedicated to having his students succeed. The material is difficult, but he always communicates with the class to make sure everyone is following along. He makes time to meet with students outside of class if they need help.","Difficult material, but Gooler did a great job at teaching it and answering questions. He always makes time to meet with students and explain the material further.","This class is a SNOOZEFEST. If you want a good grade though, you need to pay attention. He assigns reading assignments, but they don't help much. The paper is about 10-12 pages long, but as long as you put some effort in, he and his TA grade pretty easy. He also hardly ever lectures, which is good because he is monotone. Overall, a decent gen-ed.","sweetest old man ever! that being said lecture is a major snooze fest because he talks very quietly! only two exams and a final, fairly easy (he doesn't try to trick you) but you defs have to study because they cover so much material. is very nice when you ask questions. he wants his students to learn the material.","Very nice man, but soft spoken and a bit boring. Don't really need to read the assigned readings, especially since the textbook is really dry. The only time I did use the textbook was if I did not understand something he was saying.",He's a nice guy but the study guides he posts are sometimes a hit and miss...and all the material is from other guests lecturers. He probably taught the class no more than 6 times.,"Extremely boring lectures and can be difficult to follow if you're not paying close attention. That said, he's very understanding and the exams aren't too bad. Just as an aside, make sure you memorize all sections of anatomy, several questions on the exam about those specifics.",You can tell he has the best of intentions and is a great guy who really knows his stuff. That being said...lecture is a snoozefest and trying to pay attention to his mellow monotone voice is nearly impossible (especially in the mornings.) Study up on the posted notes and you'll be good; he doesn't try to tick you on exams.,"He's so cute! Gooler is literally the nicest man in the world and is really good explaining things one-on-one. Lectures can sometimes feel long, but his slides are generally very clear. Highly recommend reading the book because it's very simplified and easy to comprehend.","Can't comment on him too much because he rarely taught the class, all ""guest lecturers"". Exams are a bit of a toss up between a lot of powerpoint material and some book references. Know the study guides!  Going to class is not necessary but can be interesting.  He definitely wants to help you learn.",Good professor and fair.  Looks exactly like Larry David and went as far as showing a clip from Curb Your Enthusiasm in class...I couldn't help but bust out laughing.  Simply stunning. Do it...do it.,"He was alright, nothing special. Boring boring boring though!","He looks like a cross between Larry David and the guy who played A.J.'s principal on the Sopranos. Great professor, exams are okay. Doesn't review at all for the exams, and the textbook is beyond useless, though. Cool guy. Take his class."

Lectures can get boring, but to liven things up she brings along (and plays) musical instruments relevant to the country we're studying. Bonus points for the amazing TAs.","There was a lot of material in this course, which was interesting, but it was just too much. Tests are easy, and my TA graded really easily on essays. I would not recommend taking a class with Lillie Gordon because a majority of the class time is spent with her complaining about people using cell phones or laptops. Towards the end I stopped going.",Definitely learned a LOT in this class but WAY TOO MUCH work for a gen. ed. class and only 3 credits. Covered a lot of material and the exams really test on the small details,"Although I found the class to be very interesting, it was a lot of work for a 100-level, 3 credit hour GEN ED. I don't have any strong feelings toward Prof. Gordon, but what I can say is that she notices when you're not paying attention and gets mad. The tests were hard and I studied a lot. Long readings every day. Discussion was easy.","While Prof. Gordon was well liked, the TA's were generally unhelpful [I didn't know my grade until right before the final!].Many essays were graded harshly for being a GEN-ED class [they expect non-music majors to write like professional musicologists!].I really do like Prof. Gordon, but not my TA. Not recommended for a Gen-Ed if you don't like it!","I took this as an easy GenEd since it was just introductory and a 100 level course, and it turned out to be the hardest course on my schedule. The professor takes it too seriously for non-music majors. Tests are impossible no matter how much you study.","Class is super boring. Not at all what I expected. Also the professor is very uptight and doesnt allow any ""screens"" in her class - I.E. laptops, pads, etc. Thought the class would be pretty easy but its a chore just to go to lecture without falling asleep. Professor takes her class way too seriously and makes it a bore.",A lot of readings in general. Two exams and two papers. Terms are hard to memorize.

He curves the grades generously and if you deserve to pass, you will, even though the content is pretty tough. He can come down pretty harsh on people he thinks don't deserve to be in the major, which can be a weird discussion, but overall he's fine.","Very interesting class. Gorvett is one of the best professors. Explains all content clearly, as well as theory and derivation of formulas. Places emphasis on problem-solving rather than memorization of formulas. Exams are similar to FM Exam problems, and are graded very fairly. Lots of homework and in-class assignment grades too.","I really don't understand why anybody would have a problem with Prof. Gorvett. He is not only such a nice person, but he is very knowledgeable in the subjects he teaches. The only way I can explain someone having a problem with him is because they don't want to spend time studying and perhaps are doing poorly in the class.",A nice person. And easy exams only if your go over all the materials and REMEMBER them.,"He does not deeply understand the course materials, and not really be able to answer hard questions. But he's a nice guy with rich working experience~ that's it.","Generally, a nice guy. But in terms of teaching, not competent...... office hour is not very helpful",Best professor I have had so far at UIUC. He presents hard subjects in a very easy and comprehensible way. He will give you a good fundament and the rest is up to you to excel!,"HE'S THE BEST PROFESSOR, EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!","Rick is a good teacher but that's only because he's the jolliest man alive. If I didn't receive a pat on the back for being an actuarial science student every day in class or email, I'd probably drop out. He loves being an actuary so he loves teaching it. He likes to talk a lot thought and can turn what could be a 40 minute class into a 90 minute c","This guy is great at talking, and has a lot of insight. Students need to make an effort to interact with him more in class. Why - because he can be long winded if need be, and can talk about a really simple concept for a long time.",He's awesome.  He and Hildebrand basically define the actuarial science program.,"Gorvett is definitely a solid professor, maybe not quite as good as other people make him out to be.  Playing the devil's advocate he does tend to get off topic, and the homework was not always representative of the difficulty of exam problems.  All things considered though he makes most of the other professors here look like a waste of space.",excellent teacher!,"great teacher to say the least, HE is my motivation to be an actuary",Gorvett ROCKS!,very helpful,Great professor.  Does a fantastic job as head of the actuarial science department.,Gorvett ROCKS!,Gorvett was the best professor I had in college.

114009,2.3,Fred,Gottheil,359,0.49819411714133655,Really helpful course,"Really unhelpful, he writes his own textbook which he requires you to buy and comes out with a new version of his book every year, even though there are almost non-existent  changes, so you he can require students to buy new ones instead of used ones. Also his lectures are painful to listen too. Unfortunately this a mandatory class for many people.","His tests aren't easy passes, but that's because he actually cares that students are learning the material. If you attend his classes and read the book, you'll get the grade you deserve. You work for it, and you learn so much. His lectures are stories, never just a recitation of boring  slides. His book is also an interesting read.","Professor Gottheil is incredibly nice, and knowledgeable about econ. That being said I had a hard time learning anything from him. I took this class as a freshmen and got a B, maybe I am just mad about it. Since then, in the other 9 Econ courses I've taken, I've only gotten A's or A+'s. My suggestion is to teach yourself the course from the book.","This was one of the best classes I took at the U of I! I didn't think I was going to be interested in Economics, but Professor Gottheil made it very interesting with his stories and examples! I found out that 100% of the proceeds from his book go directly into Josh's Fund, scholarships for nurses who preform bone marrow transplants. Amazing!!!","""I've taught this course over a thousand times but I'm always excited for the next class."" Gottheil genuinely values the content and loves teaching. He explains complex concepts in very simple, real-life examples. He's personable and entertaining. His tests may be challenging because he really cares that students fully grasp the material.","Very tough professor, the lectures are difficult to follow, expecations on assignments and exams are not clear. The grades depends on ta since there are no good econ tas for his class. This old man is very hard to talk, and not approachable in office hours after all.","His lectures are extreme confusing and not organized, exams are very difficult which is really abstract and objective, TA grading harshly, he is a terrible professor and not sure why he teach Economics rather than any other subjects, not recommended.","Very boring lectures, makes you buy a book that he wrote for $275, then encourages you to pay an extra $15 to subscribe to the Wall Street Journal. I've never met a professor that makes you purchase his/her own book (usually they just give it to you in PDF). I could have learned more about macroeconomics for free at the public library.","Professor Gottheil has been my favorite economics professor thus far. Instead of teaching the typical profit driven economics course, he focuses on quality of life and pursuit of happiness. If you have the opportunity to take a 490 with him do it. You won't have to work too hard and you'll come out a better person.","Get in a small class with him - preferably a 490 where he is able to connect with students. Technically he teaches economics, but really he teaches life. Prof. Gottheil is one of the few profs on this campus who has actually changed my life. Every econ major should be required to take one of his 490s.","His lectures can be boring, but sometimes they are hilarious because he loves to tell stories. For the most part, he explains things well and he knows what he is talking about. The homework is really easy and comes straight from the book. The exams are essay format and long, but if you read the book, they are extremely easy. Highly recommend.","I don't understand how people say Gottheil is hard. This was probably one of the easiest classes I've taken in college. Test questions are 100% from the book which means you don't have to go to class. You have the answers to the quizes before you take them, you just need to memorize them. If you can't do well in this class, you don't belong here.","Very boring, off-topic lectures, and very difficult exams- almost impossible.",He is the best professor I have met!,He is a very nice man who loves what he does. I highly recommend reading the book if you take his class. He is very good at explaining with examples and although his test are not super easy you learn quite a bit. He makes big lectures feel small and interesting.,Most comments about Gotheil are not true. He is a great professor who knows his stuff about econ. I went to class everyday read his textbook and got an A. Those who say he is unfair did not put in the effort to receive a good grade. Students determined to do well have success in his class.,"Macro can be an easy A. You have to be an active reader, internalizing the examples/concepts as you go so that they become common sense to you (~1 chapter/week + online homework). Go to lecture because he hints towards material that will be on exams (free response) &amp; gives pop quizzes. My TA was great and having taken Micro in HS helped me a lot.","He isn't easy but isn't hard. If you take the time to study throughout the semester, you'll be fine. I took the make up midterm and it was easier than the other midterm. I don't knoe if this is a patern but thought i would add it.","He very smart but doesn't cover much in the class, but you need to attend in order to get the pop quiz points.

I am not an anthropology major nor am I very good at this subject. There are no tests which is awesome! All you do is read articles and do blog posts once a week reflecting on them. At the end of the semester you have to expand on one of your blog posts with a 6 page essay.

She's really nice in general, and is extremely intelligent.","Dr. Gottlieb is one of the most intelligent professors I have had the pleasure of knowing. In saying that, however, she was also one of the most stressful and analytical teachers I have ever had. I never missed a class, read all of the assigned readings, turned in every paper on time and still received a B. Very frustrating and ridiculous.",She was extremely opinionated and demanded a lot from her students.  The reading was near impossible to keep up with. Papers were graded very strictly according to the rubric.,"Opinionated to the point where she thinks she can pick her own facts.  Condescending, obviously prizes her own intellect greatly.  If you're uncomfortable drinking her Kool-Aid I would not suggest taking this class.","Although I enjoyed the class overall Dr. Gottlieb is very opinionated.  You will learn all about the Beng people of Africa because that is the group she studied.  She relates nearly every topic of life to them.  The class is quite a bit of work.  There are daily reading assignments you must keep up with, weekly papers, and a ridiculous project at t","If you are an 'other' she's going to tell you she 'knows how you feel', which is very patronizing at times--reducing your intellectual arguements to merely emotional ones.  A good advocate if she likes you, though.","very hyper/spacy prof but at least she is interested in teaching and her work. DO NOT miss class and expect to get favors from her. She told me she did not miss ONE class during her undergrad career so she will not be flexible if you miss a pop quiz!","Lots of papers to write, but she's very knowledgeable and knows a lot about all of the topics...this was an awesome/informative class","She can be nuts, but a good nuts.

And he's good looking and funny!","I am an A student, and this class was one of the hardest I have had to take.

We had to write a paper every week, but at least the papers were focused on solving management issues.

Tests usually averaged around a 65 for 250 students. I strongly advise against taking this class.","Grabner is a very caring professor. If you don't liked a flipped classroom, this class may not be for you. Lecture is almost pointless as you spend the whole time answering ten simple clicker questions.

Gulley takes a thorough and critical yet fun approach to some pretty complicated topics. If you ask questions in class, he gladly answers them. PSYC/NEUR 413 exams can be hard (a good chunk of students failed the 2nd one), but they're not that bad. Study in advance and don't neglect any details on the slides unless Gulley says so.","Very interesting class. Gulley is a great professor, a lot of fun. This class is tough though. Study a week in advance at least for exams",Great professor. Course material is hard if you have no biology/chemistry background but its not hard to catch up. Makes an effort to answer all in-class questions and makes sure to explain everything clearly.,"His lectures are very clear and organized, but be warned, there's a lot of biological terms that you may not be familiar with if you're a psych major. There's a lot of material to know but it's well-presented and the tests are straight from the notes. He does a good job of making the class fun and helping you when you need it",Easily one of my favorite profs at U of I. Incredibly knowledgeable and helpful. This class wasn't easy by any means but he makes it so interesting that it's not difficult to study for.,take it in the spring. much easier,"I thought it was the hardest section based on the material. Yet, I really enjoyed his lecturing style. He is easy to understand. The test was kind of hard. He had to curve it. His material is based a lot in biology, so study a lot if you're just a psych major.",This class is SUPER EASY. The material is straight out of the notes.,"Definitely helpful to have a strong biology background before taking this class. However, Dr. Gulley's lecture slides are easy to follow and he makes lectures entertaining. Tests are non-cumulative, but the essay questions on them were pretty tough.","psych 210 is taught by 4 teachers, dr. gulley teaches the first section.  i thought dr. gulley made most lectures fun with his silly jokes and movies.  i didn't think the test was hard.  it straightforward and i just studied the notes and got an a.",Liked the way he presented lectures. I found him easy to understand and you can tell he really enjoys what he teaches. Tests weren't too hard and they definitely focused on what he talked about in class versus so much from the textbook.,"Psych majors will consider this class hard, probably the hardest in the psych major actually.  But compared to other (real) classes on campus, it is a 3/5.  Gulley is a GREAT professor though, he really cares about the subject and his students, if you have any questions don't hesitate to ask him or go to his office hours.  Lecture is very enjoyable","it's really late and I clicked the wrong circles, those should have been 4's so I'll give him 5s to sort of even it out. Sorry!","Test was pretty easy...straight from the notes.  His posted power points slides didn't always make sense as the thoughts weren't always connected.  In lecture, he would not add much to the slides, so it was often hard to figure out what it was talking about."

She takes questions but sometimes her answers weren't great.,"The professor welcomes you to ask; however, her ability to explain things could be improved. Get ready to self-study the textbook!","Have trouble in keeping her own words. Often forget to update the homework. Nothing is original. Uses other professors' quizzes, homework and midterms.","There is nothing good about her. Students rarely understand what she is talking about, and we have to learn by ourselves. She does not seem to care about her students' progress even if the class size is extremely small. The honor homeworks are ridiculous, extremely hard, and useless. Avoid her if you cannot discipline yourself to do self-learning",Self learning matters,"She skipped important materials and expected students to understand all the materials by themselves in a really short time(basically no time). For me, it's okay to have lots of homework and hard exams as long as I know what I'm  doing but she was so confusing and misunderstood students' questions... We had to learn everything by ourselves. AVOID!","She is not a good teacher period. She has temper outbursts, does not care about the students, gives very little feedback and gets grumpy and moody for no reason. Needs to take a chill pill. Her accent is thick, every other sentence has a grammar mistake, it gets to you after a while.","I guess she knows the material herself but doesn't care much about this class since the class emphasizes more on engineering applications. She's helpful in office hours and can explain the intuition behind the concept. After you know her exam style from the first midterm, the later exams are relatively easy and are completely what I would expect.","The only issue I had with this professor is that she doesn't accept alternate methods of completing problems outside of what she shows you in class. Also, make sure your work is clear and includes EVERY step - I once should have gotten a 100% on an exam, but instead got a 90% because my work was unclear/not what she wanted.","Funda is a great and lovely professor. She's willing for help and she's very helpful during the office hours.  People who think her tests are hard is because they didn't study. Her exams are straight forward with 10 bonus points. Remember, it's proof class, don't think you are better than professor, be modest and put some effort, you'll sget an A.",She's honestly not that bad. Tests were hard but she gave a VERY generous curve at the end. She is also pretty hot..,"Not a great professor, although she did teach you everything you need in class, she doesn't care if students understand it or not. Can't give useful answers to students' questions.",Hard course. Hard class. Hard exam and she is extremely strict to every one except herself.,"Gultepe made more mistakes in her examples than I have ever seen a teacher make in my life. She can not make any positive connection with her students, her lectures are boring, perhaps a by-product of her terrible English. Avoid Gultepe  at all costs.",Terrible instructor.  Tons of homework.  Harsh Grader.  Absolutely no curve.  Tests are hard.  OMG... Hopefully I could get an B+.,"I wish I took this class from some other instructor. Turned a perfectly enjoyable subject into a painful experience.  Prone to flattery, so you know guys! I am not sure why she exercises such hostility for 99% of her students3219. Awful in explaining, terrible English-not just the accent her grammar is poor too.","I beg to differ with the previous post. If Gultepe's accent is so thick that the majority of the students have trouble understanding her, then it poses a bigger problem. Whatever ""Turkish accent"" means foreign to me but we as students  should not be constantly taking notes and suffer in her hands,  because Gultepe has poor English.","I have to say something for Professor Gultepe. She is an incredibly nice professor if you have ever gone to her office and asked questions. She has Turkish accent so that students may have problem what she is saying during lectures. However, if you copy down everything she wrote during lecture you will get an A guaranteed.","She made more mistakes in her examples than I have ever seen a teacher make in my life. Hard to understand her English.  She puts us to sleep, boring lectures."

His lectures can be very confusing. However, he does have open door office hours and responds to requested office hours very quickly. He often helps you in office hours on what to study for the exam.","This class was pretty hard. What he teaches in lecture seems easier compared to what's on the exam. His analogies are helpful sometimes. He's a pretty new professor, so some exams can be easier than others, but overall they are pretty hard. At the end of the semester, since almost EVERYONE failed the final, he added a bunch of extra credit points.",He is a very good guy who genuinely cares about his students. The tests are very hard and challenging including the finals but he curved them at the end to adjust low grade. A solid choice over Tina Huang because he teaches well. He makes you suffer in the semester but pulls through in the end. 9/10 would take again.,Nothing to say,"Lectures don't give enough information about the content. The exams are rarely curved and brutal, filled with various twists to the point where it's less about content and more about reading past intentionally poorly worded questions.

He tries his best to help all his students and understand the concepts. If you put in the work to understand the topics and do extra practice, you will get an A in this class.","His lectures were sometimes confusing if you don't read the chapters ahead of time, but he always offered to set up appointments for office hours if anyone needed help. Of course, you have to put in the work to get a good grade. His tests are reasonable as long as you study and read the questions carefully during the test.",One of the worst professors I've ever had. Do everything you can to make sure you do not have him if you want a good grade in chem. Tests are almost impossible and are nothing like the practice exams.,"Hes very condescending when students do badly on his difficult tests, even though he admits to making them hard on purpose. Also, aftee a student said he used too many stories/metaphors in his explanations and it was confusing, he started to use even more stories.","He has a genuine desire for his students to succeed. However, the class is very difficult. The quizzes and practice exam questions do not adequately prepare you for the tests. Be prepared to do a lot of additional practice problems and reteaching yourself the concepts.","His tests are very difficult and dont match the content we learn in lecture/discussion at all. Despite students doing very poorly on his tests, he simply tells us that were not thinking hard enough, and looks down on students who do poorly. It seems that the positive reviews are from previous years, when his class was much easier.","Reads off slides which he copies straight from the textbook. But then he puts in useless anecdotes and train-of-thought concepts that make no sense and makes the class nonsensical. His exams are twice as hard as any homework, quiz or online assignment. Bad teaching, worse prep. Also no retakes - not close to as good or lenient as other professors.","His lectures were extremely convoluted and at sometimes seemingly philosophical. He does not explain the material on which he tests on because he expects you to understand the ""story"" behind the content and assumes that most of his questions can be solved using basic logic.",Don't have anything to say,"He is a genuinely nice person who really cares about his students. HOWEVER, his lectures are the worst. He doesnt explain things well and I always leave lectures more confused than ever. He gives out curves, but I really had to study a lot on my own to get the grade I did. At one point I stopped taking notes because it was impossible.",Dr.G is not a great teacher. His lectures were basically useless and they never helped me in discussion. I often felt like it was my first time seeing test question on the test. His quizzes are near impossible the first time around but he does do retakes. The only reason I'm going to pass the class is bc of all the EC. If you can take Hummel do it.,He is very caring and wants everyone to do well but his lectures make absolutely no sense. I can't follow his train of thought and most of the time left lectures more confused than when I went in. He has a lot of office hours so use those but beware of his tests that are never even close to the review guides especially the final.,"Dr. G is an easy A. If you put in the work, it will directly reflect in the grade you receive! Tons of extra credit, nearly impossible to fail. Also, significantly easier than all the other chem 102 teachers!","Dr. G is an extremely caring fellow  he bent over backwards for his students. I do not regret taking him over Hummel. If you can  take him! Loads of wiggle room to ensure you get a good grade. This does not mean he is easy, though. Watch out for his midterms after the first one! They get tricky..."

He uses the previous ACE251 professor's slides for his lectures, but frequently can't explain what's on the slides. He goes off on tangents a lot so we're really behind in our lectures. Exams are difficult - he tests on little details from the slides.","Gunderson's exams are terrible.  You need to basically memorize every lecture slide for the exams.  No multiple choice, all essay questions.  The only grades he gave were 4 exams and 1 8-10 page paper.  You have to work really hard for your grade in this class.  Pretty funny guy though.","Terrible decision to take this class.  Though there is no homework on a daily basis, the three tests are nearly impossible to study for, given that he and his notes both make zero sense.  I swear that sometimes he is speaking a different language. I will say though that he is quite entertaining. Nonetheless I have learned absolutely nothing","Very interesting/good guy.  He talks extremely fast and mumbles to himself a lot as this is very entertaining.  However, his exams are difficult and he gives no partial credit.  The class is a lot harder than it needs to be.","The only real grades were the tests plus a 10 page paper. The tests were too open-ended, and if you didn't answer to match his opinions on welfare, taxes, etc. you're screwed. TA was hardly there and not helpful. Most people were pissed when he handed tests, papers back because the grading was so unfair. Take something else.","He wears nice sweaters.  Exams are short answers, and hes a terrible grader. He will ask 3 part question and give you little or no credit if you get 2 out of 3 parts right.  He is also very picky about his answers and the grading is VERY subjective.  No homework though.  Heavily weighted 10page paper at the end, but I got a 100% cause I tried hard",Pretty much nothing is posted on compass so If you miss class you're boned.  Yes lots of EC but this is only to make up for the fact that he grades unnecessarily hard on the exams which are all open ended and some what vague plus there is a 10pg paper which is just a headache.  Not sayin you cant get a good grade just not worth the time and effort.,"I disagree with the comment below. I was in the same class and I would say this was taken out of context. Prof. Gundersen's a cool guy and keeps class interesting by breaking it up with random funny remarks. He's kind of like the educational version of Conan O'brien... except he's not on TV, but then again neither is Conan. I'd recommend the class.","He is quite entertaining. He's a funny guy and he will go off on tangents that are usually interesting and completely unrelated to class. Lots of extra credit.

My final grade went up to a B+ when I did that.",She didn't follow the syllabus because she spent five days talking bout one thing. She's very annoying to listen too and its hard to sit through the class. You don't have to show up to pass even though she says you need to. Just read the textbook and you will learn more from that than you will from her.,Her lecturers are by far the most boring I have encountered. She is not good about covering actual exam material in class. There is a $70 charge to use Aplia and a crummy eText because she can't use blackboard like everyone else. She had to make attendance mandatory because everyone skipped her class because it's a waste of time.,Look at the lecture slides online before you waste your time going to class. There's really no point unless there are multiple graphs in the slides to fill in. She spends a lot of time going over one problem... an unnecessary amount of time and it gets old. Aplia is so much harder than the actual exams,"I took the online version over the summer.  I never actually met her because she had some grad student proctor our exams.  Aplia is okay.  Just take your time, don't get frustrated and guess. When I emailed her, her responses were okay.  I mainly used Google to help me through.","She is easy to understand if you have some background knowledge in ECON. Don't be too dependent on her lecture slides, you HAVE TO read the online textbook on aplia (quite content heavy) in order to do well for the online assignments. Gives practice papers before exams, but not answers. Both lectures and discussion are not mandatory.","Her lectures are clear-cut though not the most engaging. However, she puts in a concerted effort to ensure student success. Do the Applia and the practice exams...","the aplia online homework is way too difficult compared to what we learned in class, doesn't give any extra credit, not very good at explaining when you have questions","I'm  still taking the class, but so far, she is boring to listen to. Doesn't clarify much when people ask questions or when I went to her during office hours. She gets offended if people sleep in class of leave early.   She has everything online but the graphs so you have to go to class unless you have a friend.","Never went to class after the second exam. She is very hard to listen to. Easy for some people, but tests are way harder than you'd expect.","She made the class seem a lot easier than what she made the tests out to be. Discussions were not mandatory and they were completely useless. TA's didn't help hardly at all. If you do the practice tests online you'll probably get a B on the tests. Super boring, I don't usually sleep in class and I would fall asleep a lot.","Don't need to go to lecture at all. Tests are harder than material covered in homework but still pretty easy tests. Will only curve test if everyone does awful, even then, she doesn't really curve it as much for colored students","She was really boring. I fell asleep a lot. She got really offended if people left early. Couldn't figure out the overhead projecter on multiple occasions. Didn't go very in depth, but the exams were difficult. Definitely do the practice exams on Aplia.",Easy class,"Lecture is completely useless. She was corrected multiple times by students. The powerpoints are online which she reads in class. There is a discussion section which is not mandatory. To do well, do the aplia homework, read the slides, and come to the exams.

Depending on your interest, some lecturers can be boring when going over derivations of models. But he prepares you well for quizzes as well as the exams. His grading is extremely fair and small mistakes don't cost you your grade. I would definitely recommend."
831224,3.5,Indranil,Gupta,14,0.5319441008270257,Quite clear lectures/ hws/mps,"Never this professor again. Just awful, awful, awful.",I have this chance to be student of this professor at coursera online courses. I should say that every second of this guys lectures are full of new things to learn. I really love this professor and waana to be in his circle of students.,"Every student reviews 4 papers every week, but it's almost impossible to get a meaningful feedback for it. Hard to learn something solely from paper reviews. Take ECE 526 instead  to ""learn"" something.  I highly recommend you to collaborate with his grad students or to do a project that he understands and likes if you're taking this course.",Awesome professor and class with really entertaining homework and MPs.,"Great teacher, really knows his stuff. Tests are a bit difficult and lab code is not well documented.","took an online class with him, he was clear, direct, and easy to follow.","Professor's knowledge is remarkable. Very organized course. Engaging assignments, exams and MPs. Helpful TAs. Lectures are awesome. Just listening to his lectures is enough for preparing for the exam. There were 1 or 2 minor incidences where even though students wrote what was taught in class, they were not given full credit but otherwise no issues","A knowledgeable prof. Lectures were fast &amp; felt like speeches (not engaging. if u r lost in the lect, good luck!) I love the topic but I was unable to connect together the different &amp; many concepts, presented in the lects (think a math student trying to memorize formulas wo understanding the concepts behind them). C is used. I'll learn on my own.","He decided to cut down the MP's from 4 to 2 in the middle of the semester, still keeping 20% of your grade dedicated to the MP's. This is problematic for students who prioritized class work based on how much it effects their grade.   MP's are done in C, the documentation for them are (as usual) not well done.",Good teacher,"Indy is a great teacher, and completely defied my expectations coming into the class. He likes to incorporate humor into his slides, and - though he has an accent - is entirely understandable. The MPs got to be a bit tough, but if you're interested in the subject matter then you shouldn't have a problem.",He is the professor who knows what he is teaching about. MPs are interesting and challenging. HWs and Exams are quite easy and straight forward. One can learn quite a lot from his class.,No Comments
1862207,5.0,Onni,Gust,3,0.7622517034791446,"Took this class on a whim, and so glad I did! Best professor I've had at this university. Compelling, engaging, encourages students to think critically about material in unique ways. I've never wanted to work so hard for a class. Readings are always interesting. Take a class with Onni!","I don't even know where to begin with Onni. GWS 385 was the best course I've taken at UIUC thus far and it's entirely because Onni is such an outstanding professor. I was inspired every time I came to class and produced some of my best work there. Be mindful, though. If you don't care about social justice, you won't enjoy yourself.","Onni is FABULOUS! They are a great teacher who cares about their students and our ability to learn. They are very creative, engaging, and funning. They taught me to better analyze and critique cultural imperialism, a skill each person should be familiar with. Definitely take a class with this prof if you can. Not too hard but very enjoyable"

Not bad.",what a happy man,No Comments
1211409,2.5,Rochelle,Gutierrez,18,0.4868717303918973,Social Justice NIGHTMARE.,Very bad.,Good professor. She lectures a lot and asks a lot about opinions. The class pushes you outside of your comfort zone,"I came to this University because of a talk Dr. G gave at a conference. She gave one of the most poignant descriptions of funds of knowledge as it plays out in mathematics learning. I have taken 3 of her courses now. In each, I have had to work really hard, but I have received meaningful feedback. She makes her students the focus of everything.",Listened to her at the NCTM Regional. I will disclose that I am of color. Mathematics is a Noun not a Verb. Gutierrez proclaims herself as a scholar who argues mathematics operate as whiteness and I was quite embarrassed that I shared the same intellectual space with someone who is confused about math. Students benefit from truth not fiction.,"Blew my mind away. She teaches discrimination via her theories of how races, sex, and power are not equal. She is subjective and biased towards her own opinion, you will make her mad if you do not agree with her theory of 'privilege'.",She does not care about the students or their opinions. Free thinking is not encouraged. She focuses about spreading her ideologies more so than teaching the subjects. Her ideas are not sane; she talks about privilege all the time. These classes are filled too much with her personal ideologies.,"She was Intentionally insulting to certain students, demanded that students remain after class ended on multiple occasions, and was often unclear in class and was almost never available after class.","I find that when professors are skilled they take the time to think through how to facilitate discussions in class, make the class appropriately challenging by giving readings that are meaningful. Thank you for not treating me like a robot like people who want a degree without doing any work.","Blew my mind away. I've never thought of how education and teaching were part of system designed to stop children from questioning. Through this class, I learned so much about how to authentically empower children, how to engage in deep conversations, and not to be scared of talking about race, gender, and power.",She's great!,"Dr. G is great and culturally competent! Her class had clear grading criteria &amp; your grade was based on if you tried to participate or not. She made her class a space for all expressions and opinions while still remaining true to the idea of equality in education. Understanding of different perspective, but not allowing for bigotry, Dr. G is a gem.","Dr. G professes social justice as a constant practice, and stemming from the understanding of other's circumstances. She repeatedly holds us after class ends, making rude comments to the students who leave, including insulting a student who had to leave class to go to her job. She takes student suggestions but is condescending while practicing them","Rochelle basically turns lectures into discussion. Instead of taking the time to prepare a PowerPoint or basic points on that weeks readings that we had trouble with, she has the students lead a discussion and even has them be the ones to write on the board. She gets payed to have students do her work basically. A lot of readings and no clarity...","Way too much reading and ridiculous assignments (especially the midterm), but also listens to student input on class structure, which I really appreciated.","The work load for this course is just insane. Say goodbye to your free time, as you won't see it while this class. You learn a lot, but it's just not enjoyable due to the constant stress that the course adds to your life.",Professor Gutierrez was entirely unhelpful and provided little clarity on anything. She does not respond well to student criticisms. Repeatedly gives out assignments without any thought on them at all. Get ready to be entirely confused all semester.,Unavailable for any help whatsoever.  Don't bother to buy the book; you don't use it.  Literally learned nothing in the class.
2036750,1.5,Rosemary,Guzman,44,0.3323515150370631,"I took Prof. Guzman's Math 221 last semester and honestly stopped going to lecture after 2 weeks. The lectures don't have mandatory attendance and I went through the entire course learning stuff by myself and learning in discussion sections. This being said, I think Prof Guzman knows her stuff well however isn't a good teacher (in my experience).",Got an solid A in math 220 but still cant understand clearly in her lecture. She knows the material but just cant teach effectively. The result is that I spend a lot of extra time outside class to follow the course content. An articulate professor really helps so take another if you can.,"While the information in lecture is very important, Professor Guzman is incredibly hard to follow and I ended up teaching myself this class through the book and online resources. I would highly recommend taking this course through another professor since she clearly does not care about teaching or if the students understand the material.",She is by the far the wort professor ive ever seen,Neither her speaking nor writing on the board are comprehensible.,"The material taught in this class is challenging, and it was more difficult with a professor who does not know how to teach effectively. You will be better off skipping class and studying at home because the lecture is useless. You will find more help from your TAs during discussion sessions.","The professor knows her stuff. The students do not. That remains the theme of this course throughout the entire semester. Don't bother showing up to lecture, she generally doesn't even teach the material correctly (think solids of revolution). Pray that your TA knows their stuff because if you plan on learning. Or even better, take MATH220 the A","No point of going to the lectures, you really don't learn anything. The only place I actually learn for this class is during the discussion sessions. Huge shout out to my amazing TA. The professor is just not a good teacher, it's pretty clear she understands the material but don't know how to teach them. Be prepare to do a lot learning by yourself.","My goodness that Midterm 2 was ridiculously difficult. Its enough that she doesn't do her job and teach, yet they still decide to make the midterm as algebra heavy and most room for error as possible. Its truly a Kafka-esque feeling being in her class.",Professor attempts to cover too many topics at once. Since the professor is unorganized and not able to clearly explain concepts you must put in a lot of out of class time. Material itself is not difficult but prof specific test grading rubrics make it almost impossible to get an A. Even with previous calc experience TAKE A DIFFERENT PROFESSOR!!!!,"One of the worst I've ever had. Skipping classes and learning by yourself would be the wise thing to do. She makes things more difficult than they should be and she failed to explain herself clearly. She uploads her course note online so that you might have an idea of what she's trying to teach. If you're with Guzman, be prepared to teach yourself.","Without a doubt the worst lecturer, possibly, in the United States. She is good at one thing: making her students absolutely hate calculus. She talks to the board, does not look up to see if we have questions, and is unprepared. She does not manage time and constantly goes late. Also, she does not know how to operate basic technology.","If her job is to make you not like math, she passes woth flying colors. She constantly talks to the blackboard, goes way to fast in class, and always runs out of time before teaching topics needed for homework. Definitely just skip class and teach yourself.",She's by far the worst teacher I have ever had. She teaches to the blackboard and goes so fast. She's not very loud and doesn't use the microphone system (it does work because the professor before her lecture would use it). She makes learning this already difficult material even harder. I realized I had her for math231 and immediately switched out.,"This class was challenging to begin with and by having this ""professor"", it made it 10x worse.  She does not know how to lecture one bit.  She speaks into the blackboard and does not even ask the class if they have any questions.  Be prepared to teach yourself the course and try to ask your TA if you have any questions.  If you can, don't take her!",To be 100% honest Professor Guzman was the worst teacher I've ever had. She only talks into the blackboard and is very difficult to follow.,Worst lecture I have ever had the displeasure of sitting through. Class is very difficult to begin with but she makes it even harder.,"She was boring, awful, and very confusing. I took Calc I and Calc II before taking it with her, so I skipped lectures after the first few ones because of how confusing she was. Do yourself a favor, just teach it yourself.",I had her for Calc 1 and got stuck with her for Calc 2 again because of my schedule. Her teaching is very unclear and spends a lot of time on the derivation of things but not on real problems. She falls behind/ gets off schedule often because she's not very organized. She has no grasp of whether students are understanding the material or not.,"Calc 2 is the worst class ever, having a bad professor try and teach it to you is even worse."
2286211,4.0,Hyukjun,Gweon,1,0.4186406902441111,Fair professor. Three exams and weekly hwk. Tests are based on his notes and practice problems. Hwk is basic R code similar to his online examples. The tests are on the easy side and the final is slightly harder. Would recommend.
1542915,2.4,In Hye,HA,7,0.4487285411095451,"Although I managed to get an A, I would say this class is pretty hard for a 100 level English class. The reading materials were hard to get through, especially ""The Blazing World"". However, In Hye Ha is genuinely interested in the subject and tries her best to help students.","Really disorganized, and gave incredibly difficult and intentionally-misleading pop quizzes. Her teaching style focuses more on the plot of books than anything else and really doesn't seem suited to a college-level course, and doesn't include much of anything on Enlightenment culture. She is, however, a kind person, and willing to help if you ask.","For this 200-level course, our final paper had to be 10-12 pages long after increasing from 4-6 and 6-8 page papers for our first and second essay. She made the class unnecessarily hard. Although we did not have a final exam, we were required to give a final presentation over papers we hadn't completed yet. The extra work isn't worth the credits.","Not bad to look at.  Very patient, and as long as you're respectful, she'll be respectful too.  Make sure to attend class and put legitimate effort into the papers, because she's not an easy grader.  Office hours help :)","She made class so frustrating. I never knew what she wanted out of an assignment, and I don't think she really knew either.",Hard to understand sometimes.,She is impossible to work with. I always got the feeling that the students understood the material better than she did. Her manner of teaching is very confusing and unclear.
1755495,4.0,Erin,HA,1,0.6069981438416842,"She'a the sweetest person ever, and really seems to enjoy teaching BADM 325. Sometimes a bit hard to understand, but has no problem repeating herself or explaining something further if you didn't catch what she said. Class is fairly easy, and the big group project is divided up into smaller assignments throughout the semester so it's manageable."
1845561,3.8,Jeeyoung,HA,3,0.5112821064177618,"She is a very harsh grader. There's bunch of stuffs to do for this class every single week. You have homework everyday. This class should be 5 credit, not 4. However, she is good at teaching. It's just too much work.",I really liked her as a professor.  Really fun and energetic but... lying beneath the light-hearted facade is a hard grader.  Nothing wrong with that.  Means she cares about her students actually learning the material well.,Strict. Too much homework. Harsh grader. You will talk in class every day. Class was mon-thursdays.
734755,4.0,John,Haan,2,0.38960316147981255,"Hes a pretty decent TA for the course.  He explains everything you need to know and his quizzes arent too bad.  Plus his name is Jhaan, so thats cool.",He explains concepts well but doesn't use the board well. So take down everything he says and do ont rely on what he writes.

716938,3.2,Phil,Habel,8,0.37391970703066246,ridiculous,Easy easy easy. he gave 4 assignments that involved making a chart and a one page write up. I never went to lecture and still got an A.,"Easy class that you don't need a textbook for.  He tells you in class what will be on the exam.  A bit of a pedant when it comes to graphs.  Overall, good class.  Surprise him by saying you know he's 29 and a raging Communist.","He's an ok professor, his tests are really easy, and he gives you a study guide so it's not hard to do good. He also puts all his notes online, and says they are only a rough outline, but even if you didn't go to class you would be ok.","This class was a bit confusing because of the two Professor Habels that taught it.  One Habel was fully bearded, and the other was sans beard.  I never knew which one was going to teach the class, and each Habel gave information that fully discredited his bearded or non-bearded counterpart.  I'm sure this had a purpose, but it went over my head.","Knows his stuff, but a poor teacher - focuses too much on studies and not enough on what they mean. Needs to emphasize why this stuff matters. Not confident in lecture, creating many awkward moments and divorcing his students' attention. I would not take this class again if I had the chance - political science shouldn't be this non-intuitive.","Apparently most students do not actually attend class, which makes for a favorable curve for people who do attend. Lectures are somewhat boring, but he seems new, so I guess he hasn't come up with a good format yet. Very numbers oriented, so be prepared for lots of tables and stats.","He is one of the worst professors I have ever had on campus, but he is the hottest I have ever had! A little too young to be a professor also!"
263443,2.8,Robert,Haber,24,0.2795589747402779,"Professor Haber and the TA for this course, Sikandar, have made the learning process extremely difficult, although this is not a hard class, basic numerical analysis stuff. No examples in the lecture, pure definition; grading is not reasonable; professor Haber can not even understand his own notes or the homework problem. 100 negative experience!",Notes are terrible and confusing. Take this course with a different professor to learn more and use your time better. Prof. Haber does look like George Costanza though.,"Prof. Haber's lecture notes are filled with errors and are extremely unclear. Referring to his lecture notes during homework only brings misery to his 400-level students. He expects way too much out of his students and then criticizes them after exams. While most lectures are understandable, the homework he gives is about 10 times harder.","During lecture, Professor Haber reads his lecture notes word for word. The notes themselves are very theoretical and there are almost no examples on the subjects and the examples that are in the notes are not derived well and many steps are skipped in the examples. While he seems to think that his notes are helpful, I have failed to find them so.",He doesn't like the courses he teaches and it shows. He makes multiple mistakes in lectures and doesn't correct them until weeks later. His assignments are far more intensive than any of his teachings.,this sucks.,"Lectures on notes are worthless.  He reads lecture slides  word for word.  Try to figure out when he will do examples, because they are the only useful lectures.  First exam was impossible, second two and final were just ok.  Not very helpful professor.","Haber is very underappreciated - TAM212 is considered one of the hardest classes of my curriculum, and I had dreaded it for ages. But, this man made it easy - very clear presentation, and the tests were *much* easier than the HW. I feel bad for whoever isn't havin this guy for 212.","Horrible professor, just read the book. You don't need to go to lecture. He is so tedious and boring","Easy class, but the professor has better things to do with his time. He is very intelligent but did not put effort to teach the class. Heard his class got 10-15 points better than the other TAM 251 section last fall so take all this knowing that he knows his stuff.",Horrible Professor! Classes were boring. Never went to class. I wish i had a different professor. Tests were tough. Grading scales is harsh and no curves!,"Prof. Haber is an AMAZING professor. I always left the lectures wanting to learn more. Overall, a GREAT professor for a GREAT class!!",He was terrible God Awful I have never had such a good time filling out an ICES form for him I hope that maybe he quits teaching to spare future students as I write this the people at my table are staring at me!!! asians!!,Awful teacher. He would just read off his notes and when there was something wrong on his notes he would take a while to figure it out.  He doesn't know the material well and he only does one example a class period because he goes so slow.,He is a terrible professor and is absolutely useless. He'd sometimes only do 1 example per lecture and not explain a single thing he was doing. BORING!,"Material isn't that bad, but his lectures are extremely boring. It's very hard to stay awake. Homework takes around 4 hours a week, tests are ok though.","He is pretty friggin boring.  The class itself isn't too bad, although it takes forever to do some of the problems that get assigned.","He was extremely boring, even back in 1997.  His weekly quizzes do not always correlate to the material covered.  Also, the skip one policy doesn't work if you're ill.  I had an eye illness that prevented me from taking 2 of the quizzes, he DOES NOT accept medical excuses, even with a note; therefore, I received a C for missing a quiz.",The class was easy. The lectures were boring. Only good thing about him is that (for this class at least) he makes not paying attention easy.,No Comments
